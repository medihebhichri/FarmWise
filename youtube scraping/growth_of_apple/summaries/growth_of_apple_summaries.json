            "summary": "The article discusses how farmers grow the same type of apple, despite each seed being genetically unique. The technique used is called \"grafting\", where a piece of the desired variety is cut and attached to a rootstock. Grafting allows farmers to control the characteristics of the tree and produce consistent apples. Lyman Orchards, an American farm that has been growing apples since 1741, demonstrates this process. The article also covers other aspects of apple production, such as cross-pollination by bees, pruning and shaping trees, and controlling pests using methods like mating disruption and sticky traps. Additionally, it highlights the importance of eating apple peels, which are rich in vitamins and fiber. The article concludes with some creative ideas for using apples in cooking and baking. \nWord Count: 420\n\nNote: I tried to condense the main points of the text into a summary while maintaining its original tone and style as much as possible.

The apple tastes the same as a regular apple, but the speaker feels uneasy about it, wondering if GM foods are something humans should be doing.

            "summary": "Apple's organizational design is less known than its innovative products. The company uses a functional structure, where departments are headed by experts with decision rights for their domain. This allows technical leaders to predict which technologies and designs will succeed. Apple competes in a market with rapid technological change and disruption, so general managers would struggle to make decisions. Instead, R&D leaders weigh user benefits against cost considerations. For example, the senior leader Paul Hubel took a risk introducing a costly dual-lens camera in the iPhone 7 Plus, which became a defining feature. This structure enables Apple to balance attention to costs with value added to the user experience. The combination of its organizational structure and leadership model transformed the company into one of the most influential tech companies in the world.\n\nKey points:\n\n* Apple uses a functional structure\n* Departments are headed by experts with decision rights\n* Technical leaders predict which technologies will succeed\n* General managers would struggle in this market due to rapid technological change and disruption\n*",
