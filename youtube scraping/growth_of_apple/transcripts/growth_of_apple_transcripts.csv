I can take these Empire seeds, plant them in the ground, and in a few years I'll have a tree full of Empires, right? (Farmers): Wrong See, each apple seed is genetically unique. It will grow a completely different Apple from the one it came out of, which could be a major problem for farmers who want to grow the apples we know and love. But don't fear, we've come to one of America's oldest orchards to find out: How Does It Grow? The Lyman family has been growing apples here since 1741. They bought this land directly from King George. Today the ninth generation of Lymans work the farm, which has 100 acres of apples - that's precisely 27,500 trees, growing over 30 varieties of apples. Before Europeans brought their sweet apples to America, only sour crabapples grew here. Today, the US is the second largest producer of apples in the world. Americans eat more apples than any other whole fruit, except bananas - which don't even grow here... So how do farmers grow a whole orchard of the same type of Apple? Believe it or not, they use a technique borrowed from the ancient Greeks - it's called ""grafting"". (John): This is the rootstock, we're going to take a budd from the variety we'd like. We're going to cut right underneath, and we're going to put a T cut here, and as long as we go just under the surface, a cambium layer and... hit the cambium layer of the budd... matches to the rootstock...the two will fuse and create a new tree. It's vital to prune and shape each tree as it grows and to do it continuously for the life of a tree, which can be as short as twenty years, or as long as a hundred. The next important step comes in the spring when the apple trees bloom. Lyman brings in one beehive for every acre - that's 100 hives! For the flowers to turn into fruit, they have to be cross pollinated - that means the pollen in one flower has to be mixed with pollen from a different variety of Apple. The bees have about seven days to cross pollinate the whole orchard, and somehow they do it every time. The trees will produce way more flowers than they need for a full crop of apples, so it's key that farmers remove some of the fruit before it matures. As the fruit grows big and lush on the trees, it's a magnet for all kinds of pests. To limit their use of pesticides, Lyman follows a certified program called ""Eco Apple"", developed with Red Tomato - they're a nonprofit dedicated to supporting sustainable and innovative farming. Rather than spraying their trees to prevent insect attacks, Lyman monitors their orchards, so that they only respond when absolutely necessary. (John): What we have here is a red sphere, and with an apple essence we can make it like a ripe apple. We cover it with sticky material - it will capture incoming apple maggot flies. We'll monitor - if we see them, we know it's time to trim. (John): Another type of insect control is mating disruption - and basically it's an insect birth control...we have either twist ties or we have hoops - they got pheromone injected in them, and release it over time and that'll send off a scent and will confuse the male & female...they never get together. The harvest begins in early August, starting with Jersey Macs and Ginger Golds, and finishes in late October with Granny Smiths. Some of Lyman's pickers have been working these orchards for over 20 years. They wear buckets that hold almost 50 pounds, and look for apples that are 2 and 3/4 inches wide, and have their ripened color. Some apples go into low oxygen storage, which kinda puts the apples to sleep, so that they're available to eat the whole year round. apples are loaded with vitamins and fiber, but almost all of it is found in the peel - so put down those peelers! You can do so much more with apples than just make apple pie - you can put them in your salad with your favorite nuts and cheese; you can add them to your sandwich for crunch; or you can make them the bread itself by cross slicing the Apple and cutting out the core. That's just a small taste of what you can do - I'm sure you can come up with more and you better get started - there are 7,500 varieties of apples to try!"

Apple best known for? Easy answer, for its innovation
in hardware, software, and services for a wide range
of products, such as computers, iPhones, and iPads. Now here's what's
less known and equally significant about the company,
its organizational design and the associated
leadership model that have played a crucial role in
driving its innovation success. It all began after Steve
Jobs returned to Apple as CEO in 1997. One of his first
acts on his return, laying off the general managers
of all the business units in a single day, not a move
that inspires a welcome party. But there was a method
to Jobs' madness. Apple at the time had a
conventional structure for a company of
its size and scope. It was divided into
business units, each with its own profit
and loss responsibilities. Jobs believed this conventional
management stifled innovation. He put the entire
company under one P&L and combined the different
functional departments of the business units into
one functional organization. Simply put, a
functional structure divides an organization
into departments based on their function. These departments are headed
by functional managers who are experts in the
roles they supervise. The functional structure, which
Apple retains to this day, ensures that those with the
most expertise and experience in a particular domain
have the decision rights for that domain. Senior vice presidents
at Apple then, are in charge of
functions, not products. As was the case with
Jobs before him, current CEO Tim Cook
occupies the only position on the organizational chart
where the design, engineering, operations, marketing,
and retail of any of Apple's main products meet. In effect, besides
the CEO, the company operates with no conventional
general managers. Apple's structure is
based on two views. First, the organization
competes in a market with a high rate of
technological change and disruption. It has to rely on the
judgment and intuition of technical experts
who can predict which technologies and
designs are likely to succeed. General managers are unlikely
to be able to do that. Second, Apple's commitment
to offer the best possible products would not
be achieved if cost and price targets were the fixed
parameters within which to make design and engineering choices. Instead, R&D
leaders are expected to weigh the benefits to users
against cost considerations. A case in point is the decision
to introduce the dual lens camera with Portrait Mode in
the iPhone 7 Plus in 2016. Paul Hubel, a senior leader
who played a central role in the Portrait Mode
effort and his team were taking a big
risk, if users were unwilling to pay a premium
for a phone with a more costly and better
camera, the team would have less
credibility the next time it proposed an expensive
upgrade or feature. The camera turned out to be a
defining feature for the iPhone 7 Plus. Under a traditional
structure, Hubel would not have been empowered
to take such a risk and the feature
would likely not have been made because traditional
cost and price analysis lack a deep understanding
of users' needs. It's easier to get the balance
right between attention to costs and the value
added to the user experience when the leaders
making decisions are those with deep
expertise in their areas. This explains Jobs' decision
to change the way Apple works, the combination of its
organizational structure and its leadership model
not only saved the company from bankruptcy but
also transformed it into one of the most influential
tech companies in the world."

- How did that work out for you? (audience laughing) - There was a professor, I think his name was Dr. Nailor. Does that sound right?
- Tom Nailor. - Yeah, Tom Nailor. And, he was a great professor and one of the things
that he'd ask us to do was to write a 25 year plan. Maybe some of you have had to do this. And, it was more of a personal plan. And, normally I would never remember this, but I was doing a commencement
address a few years ago and I was scrambling for some old things, and I found, in a box, this plan. And, this plan had turned
yellow because of age, but I looked at it and I would say it was reasonably accurate for all of 18 to 24 months, after it was written. And, it was nothing, there was nothing, not a single thing on it
that was accurate post that, not a single thing. (audience laughing) Zero! And, I think that the lesson there is, at least for me, maybe you
guys will be different, maybe you have much more insight into what you may be doing, but for me the journey was not predictable at all. And, it goes sort of back
to the Lincoln quote, is the only thing I believe
you can do is prepare. And, the world is going
to change many times. The environment is going
to change many times. The companies that you work
for are going to ebb and flow, you may wind up in the
same company, you may not. You may wind up in the
same career, you may not. You may wind up with the
spouse you're married to now, you may not. There are lots of things in your life. I hope that one doesn't change. (audience laughing). But, there's lots of things that change, and I think that you sort of
have to have a north star. And, stay with the north star and let those things go on about you, and sort of find your, find your journey."
