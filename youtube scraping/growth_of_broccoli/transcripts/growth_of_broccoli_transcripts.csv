which is a particular variety of broccoli that produces the really big heads that we
usually find in the shops. A few of the heads I tasted were really delicious, and a lot of other people agreed. I hadn't realised that broccoli could taste
so good. In the past, a good head of broccoli occasionally
came out of my gardens, but it was rare enough. No doubt this had something to due with the
fact that I wasn't so fond of broccoli, I saw it as a finiky and overrated vegetable. But now I am a big fan, because the crop this
year was so good and so delicious. The question is, why have I been more successful
with broccoli this year than in other seasons? The good weather we've had is part of the
answer. I think a more substantial part, is that I
have finally managed to do all things that I needed to do, when they needed to be done. I selected a suitable variety of broccoli
for the climate I am growing in. I bought fresh, strong seed from a reputable
source. I used a good growing medium, or compost,
with enough fertility for the young plant. I used an appropriate sized container or block. I sowed the seed at the right time of the
year so that it was warm enough for good germination and fast growth of the seedling. I carefully watered to ensure the growing
medium stayed moist but not wet. I thinned the seedlings to one plant per pot
or block. I chose a part of the garden that didn’t
have brassicas growing on it for the past few years to reduce the chance of soil borne
diseases. I prepared the final growing beds well in
advance so that it was ready for the transplant. I added plenty of fertility to the soil. I gradually hardened off the seedlings before
transplanting. I waited for a calm, overcast day for transplanting
in order to reduce stress on the plant. I transplanted the seedlings before they got
too root bound. I carefully transplanted the plants into the
growing bed, and watered them in. I gave each plant enough space to grow to
the desired size. I protected the young seedlings from slugs
and snails. I protected them from flee beetles. I protected them from cabbage root maggots. I protected the young plants from birds, chickens,
and other animals. I prevented the beautiful white butterflies
from laying eggs on the plants to avoid caterpillars. I removed any caterpillars that did hatch,
to avoid leaf damage and I really didn’t want them inside the heads of broccoli. I watched out for a range of other diseases
or deficiencies. I continued to weed around the plants to reduce
competition. I watered the plants when necessary, especially
during the dry weather early in the season. I provided additional feeding to the plants
later in the season. I kept an eye on the plants so that I could harvest the large central head at the right time. I then left the plants in place for a few
more weeks so that I could continue to harvest the side shoots when they were ready. Failing to do any of these things could be
the difference between a great crop and a poor crop. Some of them, like letting the seedlings dry out completely or failing to protect from slugs and caterpillars, could lead to complete failure. But you can get away with a lot of things,
because plants really want to grow. A reasonable crop is possible if you don’t
follow everything on this list, but an excellent crop seems to rely on doing all of them, and probably more. Most of the tasks on this list are relatively
easy to do. But, consistency is the issue here, doing
what needs to be done at the appropriate time. Weather of course is a big unknown factor that can be really hard to prepare for, especially with the shifting and erratic climate. But high winds can be tempered with wind breaks,
crop covers can help moderate low temperatures, dry conditions can be managed with extra watering, and heat waves, well, thankfully they are not really an issue in Ireland yet. So there are always things you can do to moderate
the worst weather that each season can bring, if you are willing to put in the extra effort. Overall, this year has been a good season
for growing broccoli, as they do well and grow quickly with the moderate temperatures
and consistent moisture we have had. This fast growth makes many of the other issues less problematic. Another way of looking at this is that poor
weather, excessive heat, cold temperatures, waterlogged soils or dry soils, or high winds
can exacerbate the things that I haven't done well. For example failing to keep the crop weed
free is more of an issues in extended dry spells. Or the slow growth during cold weather can
enable the slugs that I haven’t dealt with to really damage a crop early in the season. Although it was a good crop this year, not
everything I planted produced well. In total I grew 73 plants of one variety of
Calabrese or broccoli, in 12 batches, spread across 6 gardens, with their different soil
treatments and growing methods. Out of the 73 plants I harvested 46 really
good heads of broccoli, some of them were exceptional. But, what happened to the rest of them? Slugs damaged 11 of them, either eating the
head or seriously damaging the younger plant, including killing off 5 of the plants in the
No-Dig garden. 6 suffered in the heat in the Polytunnel and
produced a smaller crop. Another 6 failed to produce well because of
too much competition within the Polycrop garden. I harvested 2 heads a bit late and they had
started to loosen up and become less tender. And I am not sure why 2 of them were so small
- perhaps they suffered from transplant shock. While it is great to be able to produce so
many really good heads of broccoli, I have some work to do to get closer to 100% success rate. I also wonder how much better even the good
ones can get, what factors can be improved. Have I tasted the best broccoli I will ever
taste, or is here more room on the scale? Is what I now consider to be exceptional,
merely just good? I am not sure what happened with this year’s
cauliflower crops though. As they are very similar plants to broccoli,
though perhaps a bit more demanding, they should respond well to the same good conditions
and treatment. Last year was more successful, but this year I have only been able to produce a few reasonable heads of cauliflower. Most of them failed to produce the dense white
curds that this vegetable is famous for. It is possible that the variety I grew this
year isn't really appropriate for my conditions. Or that the seed wasn't good enough. Or it may be some other factor that caused stress in the plants. I don't really know. I plan to conduct variety trials next year,
for both cauliflower and broccoli, growing a number of different varieties side by side,
to determine which ones are more successful, or more suitable do my gardens. Thankfully I have the space in the Back Plot
to do this kind of exploration. The other tasks are to continue to refine
the methods that I use to grow these crops, and to consistently do all the things that
need to be done. I'm looking forward to growing a really good crop of cauliflower, and to seeing how much better broccoli can get. I've known for quite a while that I needed
to do all of these things to grow a really good crop of broccoli. I read about all this stuff in books years
ago. But it has taken me quite a while to consistently, finally do all the things that I knew needed to be done. I believe this is the difference between knowledge
and skill. I had the knowledge, but I needed to develop the skill in order to adequately and consistently apply that knowledge. This of course takes time and effort, but I’m just frustrated that it took me so long with this particular crop. But this is what the RED Gardens project and
this YouTube channel are all about. Providing the context for me to learn a lot,
and develop skills, and to share it all with others. If you appreciate this kind of thing, please

project. And finally, thanks for watching."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5-kgS7dOM,vZ5-kgS7dOM,"I'm going to uh talk through what we're doing on this broccoli project uh a little bit historically and a little bit on the current efforts uh we've been getting a little bit of notoriety over the course of the past year in the popular press it's kind of been on on the spot for various audiences so we'll see how I do with this audience who actually knows the subject matter very well um so overall we're looking at building a a an e broccoli industry is the objective of the grant that we have and I'm going to cover a lot of territory today so we're not going to go super deep into anything but really from transcription factors that regulate flower development to Transportation models and I mean semi-trailers when we're talking Transportation models um so our goal this is from from the grant uh establish an Eastern industry that supplies product year round that's one of the market requirements um let's see where's my machine um so you know why would you want to do that so there's first of all there's a an opportunity in supplying broccoli this is per capita consumption of broccoli our population is going up and our per capita consumption of broccoli is going up very quickly it's very very popular you read the comments that people put in some of the newspaper articles that are published about broccoli and you think it was poison but in fact people eat a lot of stuff they want more um where does broccoli come from so each dot here um is I believe a thousand acres of broccoli produ no not a thousand several hundred acres of broccoli production but um you can see that there's a big concentration over here in California in fact in the summertime it's the coastal valleys where the fog comes in in the winter time there's some production in the Central Valley but they basically move the operation down to the desert in the East um it makes a good potato rotation crop so that coldest most northern County in the East can produce broccoli but then it really tails off as you head south and there's really a very minor amount of production so um what why is the uh opportunity to actually increase production in the East very high fuel prices in fact typical in the last few years is for California broccoli to sell for $8 in California it cost $7 to ship it here and it sells for 15 here and so producers here can actually get $15 a box uh when you have that big a transportation chunk uh there's some there's definitely some opportunity to undercut the competition uh locally grown is huge the supermarkets are actually asking for it and willing to pay for it and so supplying locally grown will make it easier for local Growers to get in the market than it has been historically um when California Supply was just a phone call away companies are focusing on corporate sustainability it's a big deal and they're actually serious about it and these are some of the companies that you probably wouldn't associate with doing good uh they are really paying attention to that we can shrink the food miles and in the California production regions nitrogen restrictions have just come on very very strictly in the last year water restrictions as some of you probably are well aware are going to be enormous this coming year they have no water um so producing an increasing Supply in California is going to be more and more challenging so these you know difficult problems in some places but an opportunity here why can't we do it first and foremost don't have varieties that are adapted to this climate and can produce reliably you get unsalable crop much too often we also have gaps in production so Maine obviously is not producing anything this time of year uh if you have a gap in the production from an area and go back to another region uh as a supply Source typically most institutional buyers will continue going to that source so you lose your customers once a year that's not a good business model fixing that's important and we also have an incomplete distribution now work it's a lot of truckloads of broccoli and right now they're heading east and west and how do you get them to go north and south um you need companies that are in that business and Logistics operations um and what are called in the economics business distribution channels so we have an economic component to deal with that also um just to give you an idea of what the path is going to be for the next uh half hour or so going to talk a little bit about the physiology and genetics of how this inflorescence and butter rest that's the important trait are controlled uh then how we're breeding for wider temperature adaptation and then talking a little bit about the U those transport models and what the the traits that the market demands um so this is the problem right here uh I'm sure you all recognize that as broccoli and I'm sure you would all walk right past it in the grocery store and not buy it right you know it's okay tastes fine yields fine has zero market value absolutely zero market value um and this is the most popular Variety in the world drown in the summertime in New York it's even worse no market value whatsoever so this is what happens much too frequently to make a business out of raising broccoli uh as a primary um crop but you know it's not that far off right it's just a little tweak and you got it so what's going on here what's making it bad so these are flower buds and the little yellow things in behind are also flower buds they're just not as big they're not as developed and what's happened is that there was a high temperature event earlier in development that resulted in those smaller flower buds sto development for a little while so the larger ones continued to develop and continued to enlarge and the smaller ones and sat there and said well no it's not the right time of year I'm going to wait and then they started growing again so they'll look perfectly fine just not at the same time as the other ones uh so the challenge is to get them coordinated uh and here's a couple of quick other examples so coliflower is basically the same thing as broccoli it just arrests at a different stage of development so this is all inflorescence meristem so each primordium that comes off that meristem makes another meristem that starts producing primordium so you get zillions of them I don't have the metric number for that but uh that is what a cauliflower head is one big inflorescence meristem but if it gets too cool it actually pushes cauliflower towards reproductive behavior and you get little floral primordia on them and it's starts to look a little rough so this happens to be a green colored variety that's unrelated to the development but and it even has a little bracks peeking up around the the uh worlds that are going to go but those little floral primordia make it look bad you can't sell it and the technical word for this is ricey because it looks a little bit like rice if it gets too warm it goes towards vegetative and so you get these little bra SE forming and the technical term for that is fuzzy and it it's a good descriptor and you can't sell that either so here we have temperature affecting how it develops now you may not have noticed but making it warmer makes it more vegetative making it cooler makes it more reproductive so developmentally heat makes it go backwards but makes it grow faster so you get faster growth faster vegetative development when it's warm so it's a little counterintuitive so here's a little bit what's going on developmentally and where the sensitive stages so uh this is work I did with Karen Pearson you'll see the people that actually did most of the work down here in the bottom left hand corner on most of the slides but so this is the development of the head and the sort of the key developmental stages that are um then regulated by the expression of various homeotic genes so here's vegetative you've got primordia coming off they develop into little leaves then you get the reproductive transition this is what you know vernalization all that uh triggers a reproductive marem looks almost exactly the same except now it's faded to produce reproductive meristems off of that and you can see there's a little a little Gap there in the uh by the leaf primordium and the Dome is a little bit bigger but then you get these reproductive Marist stems continuing to form off that Central one and it keeps going get bigger you see the little bra you can almost imagine a little cauliflower head um and then eventually it switches over and so there are these little knobs that are bald those are floral primordia just starting to form so this is the second transition here where those reproductive meristems now become flowers instead and of course the flower is terminal that's it doesn't develop more marem so if it's cauliflower continues to do that if it makes this switch when it's relatively young it makes broccoli uh in a lot of uh brasas you get all of the stages happening at once um but in this one it's kind of nice because they're very discreet steps and what we found was that the high temperature exposure somewhere in here causes that uh difference in developmental stage so this is the sensitive period where you can expose it to heat so we've taken advantage of that uh both for doing some physiology and for doing the breeding so thinking about what's the genetic basis of the different stages of Developmental arrest how long they stay where they are so when we started this work uh uh the genes of floral identity were really hot stuff so that was the place to go looking um so a pedal a one in a gene called col flower because it makes a rabid opsis look like cauliflower when it's in a double mutant with a pedala um that those had been described and were were really primed candidates and so uh a group in England did a controlled cross with a population between cauliflower and broccoli and they came up with the model that if you have all dominant you get broccoli if you have all recessive you have cauliflower and if you have some combination of dominant and recessive you get intermediates they didn't they were using um double haids so we don't know what happens if it's heterozygous at a Locus or not but this was this is the basic model and so if we have something that hinders the expression of these genes if they're dominant then you could get that arrest and so we looked at at the collection of uh all of the broccoli and some of the cauliflower uh in the germplasm repository and genotype them all to see how well does the genotype at those two Lite predict the phenotype that we see and so we tried four genetics models this one is that it's all about the cauliflower Gene second it's all about the apetala gene uh one is that it's dominant by Locus so uh if you have one Locus or the the two Loi are dominant but the AL are not with in a Locus does that make sense that's the model and then the other one is that each dominant Al of either Locus they're all equivalent it's just how many dominant alals do you have so those were our four models and we found that each of those models was significantly supported U so we can't distinguish among them but um those genes have something to do with the phenotype but then you look at how much of the phenotypic variation was explained by these genes and not much so yes those genes do what they're supposed to what they're uh what they do in arabidopsis but there's an awful lot more going on and there some examples we have here a couple of perfectly good commercial broccoli they're dominant at the apedal of one Locus here's a perfectly respectable cauliflower has exactly the same genotype uh and here's a perfectly respectable broccoli that's recessive at both low side so yeah they do something but you don't that isn't a very strong case for uh those two genes being the whole story um so just a quick review of what the story in arabidopsis is much simplified uh but as you go through development there's a vegetative marem then there's that transition to the infloresence marem the transition to Floral primordia from meristem then you have a bud completely formed and then there's anthesis when the flower opens so that's just a development and so the the homeotic genes that control this you have the terminal flower which kind of maintains the marem going it drops off then leafy which of course being named after a mutant does the opposite of what its name is that drives me crazy but that's the way it is uh so leafy comes in to start the reproductive development here U and then we have the apeda and cauliflower are involved uh early on so the question is does turning on or off one of these guys uh is that associated with the arrest so we did um well I can show you this so just looking at you know where is leafy turned on uh and you see in the vegetative Mar St it's not really there a leaf leafy expression is the white silver crystals um and it's when you start getting the reproductive maros stems you get high levels of leafy expression but then in the flower buds themselves it's rather low so that actually fits the model pretty nicely so what we used was a uh this is actually a commercial U Taiwanese cauliflower that happens to be green uh but it it does something nice we can keep the genotype the same but vary the phenotype by exposing it to different temperatures and looking at how the the gene expression changes um so when it's cool it makes flower buds right coold temperatures Drive reproductive development intermediate temperatures we get floral primordia and warm temperatures we get cauliflower so just a closeup look cauliflower right everybody agreed the little the little bumps you can imagine on this one that there those are floral primor it's just like a little lollipops there's no further development on them and again flower buds perfectly respectable broccoli so we can get those phenotypes and so we looked at the relative expression so this is using rtpcr so we can compare the expression in one condition versus in another to see whether a change in expression of a gene is associated with a developmental arrest or permitting Crossing that developmental chain so here going from cauliflower to starting the floral primordia when that step happens we see a pedala one is more highly expressed we're not seeing terminal flower turning off which the model would have predicted we're not really seeing leafy turning off either and cauliflower isn't doing anything either uh then looking at the next step from that floral primordium to a flower bud that's when we see the leafy dropping off um and the other genes are relatively constant terminal flow may be dropping we didn't wasn't detectable for us but um there's just less tissue that would have terminal flour expressed so that's a a hint that some of the things are happening but not not the change in leafy is happening at the wrong time for that model the model as we understood it there's also another very very closely related uh homeotic Gene uh mads je these are all uh they bind with each other and it's the U the diers and the tetramers that are actually binding as the regulatory regions of other genes so it's a great big mix and match game and so with for Losi a lot of possible genotypes here uh but we track them all and they're all declin ining slowly and as the development proceeds um so potentially keeping the expression of full could be a mechanism for maintaining the uh the arrest stage um but as so here this is sort of a schematic of how so how wide it is is how uh strongly expressed it is and so here's on the right is a summary of the data I just showed you uh the main point I want to make with this is that it's the same players and some are getting turned on and some are getting turned off but not at the same time as they do in arabidopsis so our knowledge of arabidopsis is helping find some of the culprits but not giving us good guidance on what they do um so at about that about the time we did that experiment they were discovering lots and lots more genes that have control in arabidopsis and other things um that may play into it and just that the rtpcr approach was U not going to work for us for exploring that further so I I did what we must Lisa Earl and I did like four Grant proposals together trying to pursue that um with some transgenic technology and we didn't get funded for that unfortunately um but there's uh Tech te that are available right now that are really really promising and John F who's here uh is we're trying to cook up something um where we can use the GBS to really look at a full survey um of what's going on in the various things we've already ftip I mean it's just sitting there so I'm really looking forward to where this is going to go there's a lot of uh promise there uh I'm going to talk a little bit about about the breeding now so when I was a relatively new student here I had not taken any plant breeding whatsoever uh the Paradigm I understood was plant physiologists discovered really cool stuff published in in papers and then the hungry but ignorant breeders would discover those papers and say aha I shall breed for this thing so I there was this young relatively new professor who was leaning enough to let me into his Advanced plant breeding class um where I promptly learned that plant breeders by and large don't care whatsoever what plant physiologists do they keep discovering all kinds of irrelevant stuff and so it turns out that we have some plant breeders working on this problem colleagues actually in constant communication with them uh but so they used some of our screening technique uh but also knew some art and made some good progress so that for for breeding the problem with this had been huge number of escapes when you try to do just selection for ones that look good you got there are many reasons why they could stay looking good the basically the hair ability was horrible and nobody was making any meaningful progress with the problem and it just wasn't a high priority enough for any breeding program uh to really put sufficient effort in it to overcome the problem but the knowledge that there's this particular time when they need to be exposed to heat turned out to be helpful in the breeding and so uh Philip griffi in Geneva um in fact he working with material that Mike Dixon his predecessor had worked on and the guy who got me into this in the first place and also Mark faram who's at the usdaa vegetable lab in South Carolina uh they had both made really nice progress and so here's a popular Variety in August no good this is one from Mark farum um that's starting to look like a real broccoli uh you could you could sell that it's not perfect but you could sell that um and so the SC uh was passed in the last farm bill and they said you know with this we want you to find a really big problem and find a complete solution to it and I think everybody said oh my God I can't do that I certainly did uh but we uh we ended up putting together a project that that got funded because it covered so many bases uh and so we wanted varieties that would tolerate the Eastern environment so what's special about the eastern envir environment here compared to to where it's typically grown our nights are warm that's the problem with the the uh different flower Bud sizes it rains a lot it rains on the harvestable part that makes it rot and other unpleasant things we got lots of bugs we've got lots of diseases and we don't have great deal of specialized Harvest Labor uh one of the big broccoli farms in California I was talking with them about potentially bringing some of their labor here to train people in picking broccoli who was saying oh yeah that's absolutely essential there's no way we would have like a lettuce Harvester cauliflower Harvest or harvest our broccoli they just couldn't deliver the quality we need so if that's your standards that that's what I mean by specialized Harvest labor um so here's our gaps so Maine can do great in the middle of summer if you're looking at the course of the year across the bottom AIS and so in the south you can uh get Harvest around New Year's and then there's a little window in the spring um the middle of summer is fairly challenging New York could well can do well in like September into our early October but these these gaps in between um where you lose the customers and so we want to increase each of those by a little bit we're not trying to have broccoli grow everywhere all the time we just need it to have the different parts of the East Coast o overlap enough so we need just a little bit of improvement like that first slide it's close but not going to cut it so we need just a little Improvement so the grant covers uh breeding Regional triing of promising breeding lines with feedback to the Breeders uh releasing and selling varieties this is a really big deal and seed companies are really good at that and so that's their function in this they're also good at breeding for that matter uh establishing a grower base I'm not going to talk about it here we have a substantial extension objective because the Growers have to be really good the competition is excellent like that grower who said he wouldn't have a cauliflower Harvester pick his broccoli uh they need to be that good to get into the game uh we need to have a distribution Network that makes sense to The Growers to the Distributors economically and to the supermarkets and consumer acceptance if there's a premium for local or if they look a little bit different uh we need to find out that people will want it and also feedback to the breeding if there are traits that the consumers are reacting to either as positive signs of localness in some physical attributes um or some we thought didn't matter too much and it turns out it does so that's that's among the traits coming in so we have three public breeding programs and three private breeding programs are involved with the project so my observation you know the physiologist uh every breeder has a unique breeding philosophy even if you're breeding for the exact same trait they all think about the problem in their own individual way and that's great that's a lot of fun for me uh but it means I'm not going to tell you anything about the nitty-gritty of how they actually do their selection because that remains an art and a mystery they all have distinctive breeding populations at least to some extent the practice in broccoli it turns out is you take the bestselling variety and you self it back and start Crossing it with everything you got that has been a fairly common technique uh among readers of broccoli so to some extent they've all stolen from each other but they all have distinct breeding populations that they're working with also so to bring a new trait which is really what we're doing here something that may be kicking around in their breeding population but they really hadn't been making a big effort to select for it some of them are going to hit the jackpot some are not you don't know until you try uh encouraging competition so my job as sort of the the ring master in here is to egg them on and say look you know here's what the the group did here you know don't you have another cross you want to test uh don't you think you need to you know look over at some of these potential parents you know just uh see that they are putting as much effort into this as they can because they all have uh ailon distraction so the competition is actually fun and also the licensing of public material obviously the public breeders are not going to be releasing and selling varieties that's not their business that's the seed company's business so so we want the seed companies to buy the public material so there's also a little bit of salesmanship going on in there so these are the Breeders uh so Mark farnam's um the one who really kicked this going but Griff uh has a lot of good material and when he starts moving on something he starts moving on something Jim Myers has been breeding uh broccoli for a long time in Oregon and that he's got two traits um that are of Interest one uh is that they have this exerted head that comes up above the rest of the plant so you can see that it's ready to harvest and it's easy to reach it originally that was the intention was mechanical Harvest but we're not there yet and the other is that he's leading uh the novic project which has a lot of fingers here with Michael Mich in particular for breeding organic broccoli and so he's been uh taking charge of making sure there's an organic specific broccoli being developed but then we have so seminis vegetable seed that's a division of Monsanto which I get a lot of uh uh comment on um Case Case uh yeah case sintony is the breeder with beo so it's a Dutch U you know privately held but multinational company and senta again their breeding is has just recently moved back to Holland um but John huitt who is a postto here in Department uh a while back is their us contact so what are the traits we're looking at so the bead uniformity what I've the main thing I've been talking about um so having a low requirement for the chilling hours if you want to call it that having a good dome uh so the Dome sheds rain so the water runs off so it doesn't rot it's that simple high temperature tends to make it flatten out so we need an especially good dome on these we need good head uniformity people are personnic about the lumpiness of the head so the extension trait Myers's uh exerted head for easy Harvest is a valuable trait uh we need to have normal or higher carotenoids so there so that broccoli is good for you people eat broccoli because it's good for you right so ours better be good for you as well um and normal or higher glucose inates this is being done by U Carl Sams and Dean csil at the University of Tennessee uh you need the head to be firm cu the supermarket buyers really expect that you need small flower buds this is really a pain because it's a hard trait to get in there um but that makes it look good at least to Asian uh wholesale buyers we don't know if Eastern consumers care so that's why the caveat is here the west coast is growing for the for for the Asian eye uh it needs to be really green so it looks good for you people associate that color with the nutritional qualities absolutely uh and you saw the green cauliflower they come in all colors purple red pale blue all kinds of things it has to be fan the seed companies are in the seed business after all if they don't grow if they don't produce a lot of seed it's not a product and we need stability across a lot of environments they need need to be widely adapted so we're doing these ratings in multiple locations we've got rating cards so everybody rates exactly the same way so it's we have genotype by environment interaction not genotype by Raider interaction uh that's that is a significant problem we spend a lot of money getting people together rating the same way so bead size you have it in the field you get that what does the Dome look like uh how uniform is the bead we need a lot of examples because it looks ugly in many different ways and how green is the green ignoring the purple just the green it's not it's not quite as simple as it sounds but everybody's rating the same way so our trials run through basically three steps we've got the same nine traits that we're rating in all of phase one but so phase one is looking at new crosses this is where all of the Breeders are trying new stuff either from their own programs or between programs um again each unique personality decides that it's ready for this phase at a different stage of development uh but we do a bunch of entries five locations a couple of planting we try to do a stressed and an unstressed what can it do in good conditions and how much does it suffer that wide adaptability some of these do quite well they go into phase two we have fewer entries there um but we do five different plantings at each location so we have 20 plantings each year out of that phase so we really have a lot of environments to compare quickly and so we can assess that stability and this is where we also do a nutritional evaluation on everything so you know first and formost we're going to throw out anything that doesn't cut it nutritionally that's the the really simple use of that but it gives us an opportunity to look at the genetic and genotype by environments impacts on the nutritional components which people really care quite a bit about uh then phase three is basically grower trials yield how many Cuts does it take to get all of the crop things that Growers are very concerned about but our research Farm trials are not going to tell them anything about so that's basically what we do here are the locations of the trials and the people who do them so we go from Southern Maine to Southern Florida they're all planted at different times um so we have the coast where the Atlantic is an important moderating influence um Long Island has a lot of potential um and then we have uh down here the mountains so it turns out in the Asheville area in North Carolina they have a shot at harvesting in July they'd have the entire Southeast Market to themselves for local broccoli if they were to expand that um and we have a lot of potential for uh acreage in in Western New York so here's here's one way to look at stability I'm just going to show you some of the controls here we do this on all the uh test varieties also but if you look at the the ratings so all of our ratings are three is marginal commercial quality four is spot-on commercial quality and five is spectacular that's the Five Point rating scale but the part we're interested in so the me median location so this is how they did in 28 different plantings um so the median rating was just about three for all of them not really any different difference at the best sites we had two that started looking good and two that still looked pretty ho but here's the thing that the Growers worry about so the if you look at the 20th percenti so one year in five or one crop in five it's going to be this bad we have one still marketable we have a couple not even close so that's the kind of stability we need to see in a really good variety so looking it how how how often does it do awul uh is an important parameter there and here's some of the things the kinds of data we pull out and are thinking about it here's just looking at a principal components analysis of all the traits that we measure um first of all you can see that the the data spread out very nicely as they should we don't have any clusters there uh but we find that two of the traits that are loaded in the same direction are bead size and firmness it turns out that small flower buds pack more tightly and big flower buds have air inside them and they squish a little bit so uh that those two move together turns out to be un unsurprising and over here we have a couple that we really care about the Dome and the bead uniformity those are the traits that the heat really affect and they're moving together yeahoo that's great that was completely unexpected but it may be easy to select those together and the other thing we worried about is whether the small beads don't hide any of the imperfections because they're too small if that were the case that would be aiming in the opposite direction of the bead uniformity but it turns out they're perpendicular to each other here so there's the potential to select them independently so we do a bunch of these biplots so this where you plot all of your uh traits against all of your traits in their rating and just I'm going to zoom in here a little bit uh so some of them there's a strong positive Association so firmness and bead size like I just said they tend to go together so they're they're positively Associated right that's that makes sense uh some of them there's no relationship so plot uniformity plant to plant uniformity has no correlation with firmness that makes sense and that's true of a lot of them but the interesting ones are here you have a negative correlation between two desirable traits so the upper right hand corner is desirable in all of these associations and so um so bead uniformity we really want bead size we really want um so this is the one where they were perpendicular in the principal components analysis so they're negatively correlated but not super tight and so for a physiologist I look at this okay they're negatively correlated see a plant reader doesn't look at it that way at all they look at oh I want the stuff in the upper right hand corner Let's ignore all those other data points and keep those right we just called those out that's that's the the cultural difference here so great they're not tightly correlated you can select some good ones and we actually do have some nice ones and so what uh what we've looked at this is a way to assess the um how well adapted they are to stress so we just do a spider plot of certain traits and the green line is how they perform when conditions are good and the red line is the stressed condition and you find something like here is Iron Man for instance so it looks pretty good it's getting high scores all the way around when the when conditions are nice and then it really collapses for several of those traits when there's stress um but then we've got some new material on the bottom row where there's really very little difference between the red line and the blue and the green line so the the temperature or the stressed environment as we understand it anyway isn't having much effect it's getting mediocre scores for firmness and bead size which just means it's it it has big flower buds again we're not convinced that the Eastern consumer is going to be wor worried about that one so this is one that would definitely move forward uh we also find some instances like number um well number two is a good case uh where we're getting a small bead so firmness and and bead size are the first two here as you're going around clockwise and we're finding that together with something that that has good bead uniformity good dome and neither bead uniformity nor Dome moves at all with stress so we're combining some different traits that we thought would be difficult to com combin they're showing up together this is very promising um so the seed companies so far so after three years of breeding the seed companies have released six varieties we're expecting two new varieties to come out um so this is stuff that was in their pipeline largely they're now making crosses between public and private programs uh several crosses among the public programs uh to really put the TR together the traits we want so we're now actually in the field with varieties that are an incred incremental improvement over what we had um and yeah so there's and there will be a lot more in the pipeline so the breeding is very exciting coming right along and going all the way to the the seed bag and the Seed Catalog um give you an idea of the transportation because this is something we don't often think about say oh we'll just plant more and this is the flow of broccoli in the summertime when most of our production happen so you have sources in California Source in Maine uh and so all of this California broccoli coming in the circles are the are the major markets and so this is something sh atala uh a student with Miguel Gomez in the Dyson school have worked on um that Maine comes in and basically hits New England and New York City and increasing production in Upstate New York would generally Supply markets in Western New York and west of us it we would have a lot of trouble getting into the New York City Market because of the supply from Maine wouldn't have expected that but that shows you where where to target the efforts um and the Carolinas rather than going north to the DC Philadelphia area makes a lot more sense sense to head south towards Atlanta um but the mod so our model shows this is on the sustainability if if Eastern production went up by 30% and that's not a whole lot uh the total us cost of broccoli so the amount of money spent on broccoli in the United States drops by 1% that's not bad I mean 30% more of it tiny production area having that b big an impact is not bad it also reduced es the food miles of the average Eastern broccoli by 100 miles that's not bad that's a significant uh effect on on food miles it's still around 1,500 but still it takes it down some so we can we can hit the the trait if you will of sustainability a little bit so the consumers they care about appearance potentially the tenderness and sweetness of local uh so shy found is a graduate student also with Miguel and she's been doing the consumer trial so here is a set of consumers we did uh in this wonderful laboratory in the newly renovated Warren Hall uh where we can do testing so we we actually excluded students only real consumers so they had to go through IRB and everything to to be allowed to do this uh but basically they got three samples so three that they got to taste that had been parboiled um and three heads where we had the control this was a California broccoli in the middle now basically looks perfect then we had a was a breeding line it's hard to tell in this picture it had the larger flower buds and because of the wax on the surface it also came across as a lighter green color just a little bit now we all thought it looked great but was that different qualitative difference meaningful to the consumer it's really important to feed that information back to the Breeders and uh C was a a good commercial variety but it was just showing a little bit of heat stress so how tolerant is the Eastern consumer of this primary uh appearance defect that we get how much can we get away with how how much do we actually have to improve that trait and how much can we tolerate a lower standard than the Western shippers have and so it turns out that um if you tell the consumers that it's New York grown then and but the middle one is is California grown then they're willing to pay more for the for the local and they told us they tasted better so that that had something to do with it if we just told them it was Easter drone so this the local connection the Community Connection is much weaker with the term Eastern than New York uh it dropped a little but surprisingly not very much less uh so the idea of having the regionally produced product looks promising if you didn't tell them anything and just showed them the material then it was a little bit lower for the the two new ones so combining the local um with the uh the different slightly different quality seems to work um and people read all kinds of things into it I talked with one of the panelists as they were leaving um and said oh I like C the best that was a little raggedy looking one said yeah that was the organic one I like the organic one nobody had said organic during the whole thing this it was never raised or hinted at so what went through people's minds when they put these prices on on them can be a whole slew of things but we don't care about the mechanism at this point we just compare care about the results does it sell will supermarkets start buying Eastern product even if it has some little different appearance and numbers like this says yes they should so to wrap it up we have um so we need to close all of these economic bottlenecks the breeder the seed companies The Growers the supermarkets they all have to make money and they are so having our breeders cooperate with each other to some extent and uh IG on is working uh we're really concerned about the expectations of the buyers the whole I mean the whole issue with appearance it's all in buyer expectations we're really dealing with that uh and the number that we put in the grant proposal that just scared me to no end when we put it in it looks like we're on target that by the the next egg census after the project is done should show $100 million of Eastern broccoli production so I have a slide with a lot of names on it but I'll just show this one as some of the key Cooperators and what I've talked about today so uh the one in bold they gave us 3 million bucks I'm very thankful to them uh bunch of companies that have agreed to invest an additional three million bucks I'm very thankful to them uh so we have Joe X eckl is my program manager um and um so we have the Breeders that I mentioned earlier and U my colleagues at the germplasm repository in Geneva did a lot of the genetics work with me and Denise Duo is a fabulous graduate student who did all the gene expression work so with that thank you very much"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQ_6HUeaSAA,uQ_6HUeaSAA,i cut my seeds before i plant them look at how tough this seed is if i try to plant this could take weeks to come up so to speed it up you just make a tiny little cut right here and the water can come in and these little seedlings are ready in three days which is why i
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSjwmlnLi08,aSjwmlnLi08,"- [Dr. Patrick]: The last question in this section 
has to do with storing broccoli sprouts. So   once they're grown in a big batch...if 
you grow them in a big batch, sorry,   what's the best way to store them? 
The freezer, the refrigerator?   How long can they be frozen, or how long can 
they be refrigerated and still be potent? - [Dr. Fahey]: Yeah. So good question. You grow 
them, how do you harvest them? Harvesting is   taking the jar... This jar has water, but this is 
one of my sprouting jars. You take this jar and   you put it in the refrigerator. What does that do? 
It slows the growth rate of the sprouts down to   a very, very slow crawl so they 
don't increase in size very much. You would leave them in the refrigerator, I 
leave them in the refrigerator, for a short time,   a few days, two or three days. Only because after 
that time there's more and more risk that whatever   bacteria are associated with those sprouts when 
you grow them are going to start to proliferate.   They get sort of rank and grungy after, you 
know, certainly a week in the refrigerator,   in my experience. And you've certainly seen that 
if you've bought sprouts in the grocery store,   they get...you know, sometimes half of the...or 
three-quarters of the sprouts in the sprout...the   little tiny sprout part of the supermarket 
are rank and I wouldn't want to touch them.   They just spoil very quickly. If you're going to keep them for a 
long time and you make a large batch,   by far the easiest way to preserve them, I think, 
is to just spread them out on a cookie tray or,   you know, a baking tin, put waxed paper 
on it if you want, and quick-freeze them.   And then when you quick-freeze them, you 
can bundle them and put them in a bag or a   container, and then you can keep them for, you 
know, weeks or even months. Myrosinase will   remain active. I mean we haven't done kilo curves 
to see how many weeks of freezing broccoli sprouts   in a home freezer will work, but home freezers do 
have a freeze thaw...or a defrost cycle and that   may actually allow the sprouts to keep on sort of 
thawing a little bit and myrosinase may activate,   and then you may sort of use it up to be 
sort of the 30,000-foot view of what might   happen there. So I wouldn't keep them for more 
than a month or two in the freezer, but yeah."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGti1Ml49qI,hGti1Ml49qI,crooked stems and droopy broccoli seedlings no problem plant them extra deep but will they survive that's what this video is all about let the experiment begin all right i'm going to let you in on a little bit of a secret here i've never been able to grow great-looking broccoli seedlings i don't know what it is no matter what i do in the nursery supplementary light no light closer to the light further away from the light indoors outdoors they always come up crooked i just can't seem to get them right and as a result when i plant them they go into the ground crooked and they grow up to be crooked and they never grow well at all is this just me do you have this problem and if you don't have the problem what are you doing to avoid this problem how are you getting these nice straight broccoli seedlings it seems to be the impossible task that i can't conquer so instead of trying to conquer it i'm trying to adapt and work with it so the question i'm trying to answer today is how deep can i plant those crooked broccoli plants so hopefully i get a nice straight plant in the field when you ask the question how deep should you plant something there's not a lot of great answers out there in the gardening world outside of tomatoes and things like strawberries there's just not a lot of great rules of thumb in terms of how deep the plants stop a lot of the stock answers sound something like this simply plant the plant so the soil level of the seedling matches the soil level of the field now that's all well and good if you have a nice straight seedling or a viney plant that's going to creep all over the ground but if you have a plant that's supposed to be straight and it's not if you just plant it at soil level then it's crooked when it goes in and it's going to grow up to be crooked and it's going to fall over can we do something like tomatoes with not tomatoes can we plant them deeper so we bury the crooked part of the stem so what grows above surface in the field actually comes up straight i don't know let's try here's the experiment i have a bunch of broccoli seedlings and i'm going to plant them into the raised bed three different ways and then we're going to compare the results the first way that they're going to go in soil level in the cell tray is going to match soil level in the field just like that stock answer we're going to do what it says variation number two we'll plant it deep enough so the cotyledons are just sticking out of the surface variation number three we're gonna bury the cotyledons and plant them extra deep the benefit of planting them extra deep is we can bury the crooked part of the stem so what grows above surface will be straight but the big question is is will they survive one of my initial thoughts on soil depth planting is it's like it's just a safety measure it's a great universal starting point well i don't know how deep you can actually plant so just keep the plant where it was growing when you bought it or when you were growing it and put it into the field that way and it should keep growing fine and i kind of think that's where some of the experimentation stopped but at the end of the day it makes sense because that approach is universal it's easy and if you just do it you know it's going to work but like all things it might not be best but sometimes easy is better than best ah i digress observations from this experiment all plants survive so soil depth didn't affect plant survivability they all survived now let's just look at the two extremes planted at the same depth that it was in the cell tray planted extra deep beyond the cotyledons cell tray depth we have faster growth we have it already producing a head we have a crooked stem that didn't affect growth at least from what i can see planted extra deep we have slower growth we don't have a fruiting head yet but the plant is nice and straight now one question would be is does the bent stem affect performance is there something with like nutrient water flow that in a perfect world this same plant with a straight stem would do a lot better i don't know this plant was also growing at the edge of the bed so we have to think about edge effect meaning how close is the plant to the edge of the bed because the edge of the bed has very unique conditions there's more light there and there's less water there there's also more heat there since it's at that soil bed interface so the edge of the bed could account for some of the growth patterns that we're seeing in order to rule out the edge effect we're going to have to scramble up mix up the seedlings interplant all these different plants different ways and see which one grows the best that takes away the edge effect and we focus on just the depth of planting if we ignore edge effect planting depth apparently doesn't matter you get survivability and as long as the plants survive then we can do more testing we can do optimization because there's a lot of factors we need to think about in how we're trying to get a plant to grow do we want it to grow fast do we want it to produce fruit fast or do we want it to be healthier and can we have all of those in the same bag maybe this one is more resilient to heat maybe this one is more resilient to drought because there's more roots in it because we've now given the roots more area to form i know i know people want specific results so specific results here are 100 survivability no matter how deep you plant a broccoli plant within reason who knows maybe next time we'll go deeper results that are up for question are does planting it extra deep actually slow down growth comma but do you get better growth at a slower rate that's going to require some more testing like all things in gardening don't take this as gospel use it as a starting point start here planting plants at different depths on a small scale and see what works best in your location my results might not match up with your results maybe climate soil or microorganisms within that soil have an effect on how deep you can actually do this style of planting in my case plantar extra deep it worked great it was slower but the plants grew straight and they grew really nice this experiment also got me thinking what other plants could we try this for green beans cabbage others like that can we get better growth by planting plants extra deep and by better growth here's what i mean maybe the plant grows faster maybe the plant grows healthier maybe it's more resistant to disease maybe it produces fruit faster maybe it's more resilient to heat stress this is something that i think there's some legs here and we need to kind of put down roots pun intended into this theory of how deep we actually plant garden vegetables should there be a standard depth is soil depth always the right move so it's experiment time and i shouldn't just be the only one doing these types of experiments do some of these experiments at home start planting different plants extra deep and see if you notice different effects on depth of planting and other factors like growth rate does one plant do better if you plant it at a different depth in your climate and your conditions let me know if you've done something like this in the past below but experiment science tinkering this is fun stuff if you want to see more videos like this in the future let me know in the comments below thanks for watching until next time be nice be thankful and do the work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeXkg2vR1ms,BeXkg2vR1ms,back to barely gardening with me Justin bear so what I do today is I cut you can you can see I cut this broccoli to like this right and then what I did was I took it over here and I just put them in the ground this is just a test this is kind of in the shade so I'm just testing to see if just planting a cutting of a broccoli will produce broccoli that's edible meaning that it has good flavor are you interested to learn more then follow me Justin bear I'm barely gardening here on YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj5opTbux4s,Pj5opTbux4s,welcome to the digging deeper best practices for broccoli brussels sprouts cabbage and cauliflower lesson i'm jenna niece and i'm the purdue extension ag natural resources educator in putnam county i also serve as the adult education coordinator to the putnam county soil and water conservation district i am pleased to be offering this session of the digging deeper series that's being hosted by the purdue extension ag and natural resources educators in area 5. on the screen you'll find a list of all the educators that are part of the area 5. we're all here to answer questions that you may have about gardening insects pest problems so feel free to reach out to any of us even if you live outside of one of our counties now today we are going to focus on broccoli brussels sprouts cabbage and cauliflower and you may think well what do these plants all have in common why would you talk about them during the same session well each of these plants belong to the same species brassica oloracia they have been selected for a specific form or feature like for example cauliflower it's grown for its immature flower head collectively these vegetables are known as coal crops coal crops prefer cool temperatures they need steady growth for good productivity cold temperatures after planting hot weather as the crop matures and inconsistent soil moisture can slow growth and cause problems therefore there are years when it's really difficult to end up getting a good harvest of these vegetables these four plants are mostly prone to the same insects and disease problems so crop rotation is an important management tool that you'll want to consider doing now that we've talked briefly about the similarities and why we talk are talking about them during the same presentation we now want to shift gears and talk about each one of these plants individually the first one we're going to talk about is broccoli there are different types of broccoli there is the annual green type that we are very familiar with there is also a purple heading broccoli that is a little bit more rare than romesco broccoli that has a yellowish green chronicle group of buds arranged in a spiral then there is a sprouting broccoli now the sprouting broccoli is not um grown um very frequent in the united states broccoli heads are harvested for consumption and usually have a diameter larger than two and a half inches the shoots are immature heads that will not become as large as the true head but they can also be harvested too the head consists of florets buds leaves stalks and stems the plant will grow to about three feet tall now in the spring you can start broccoli in your garden as transplants these transplants can be purchased at many big box retail stores or you can grow them from seed on your own for seed or for spring planting start your seeds indoors about five to seven weeks before you want to put them outside for optimum genera germination they need temperatures of about 70 to 80 degrees fahrenheit the seeds should be planted a quarter to a half an inch deep and typically ceilings will merge in about five days you can put your transplant outside about four to six weeks before the last average frost date for your location so you need to be aware of when that occurs ceiling should have about four leaves on them if they're smaller than that then they may not be able to survive any frost that might occur now plants should be spaced 18 to 24 inches apart with rows approximately 36 inches apart planning can continue into april and through may in some of the coldest parts of indiana now planning for our fall harvest is done in late spring or late summer if using transplants assume harvest will be on the average first frost date then count back the number of days from transplant to the harvest for your cultivar plus 10 days you can grow these transplants from seed also since the soil has already warmed up if you plant the seeds directly into the soil make sure you allow time for the transplants to get to the right age to match up with the example we provide earlier on when to put transplants out for a fall harvest broccoli it needs well drained for fertile soil and full sun you really want to avoid sandy or poorly drained soil if at all possible adequate soil moisture should be about three to four inches down into the soil broccoli prefers a soil ph that's six to six point five which is slightly acidic as always we recommend doing a soil test before you make any large changes or any for large fertilizer application near your garden however you want to give your plant just a little start with some extra starter fertilizer that's okay um you can also side dress your broccoli with 0.1 pound of actual nitrogen per 100 square feet about three weeks after you've transplanted because that's when the plants going to be actively growing now remember to read and follow all label instructions on how to apply your fertilizer appropriately now there are a number of different varieties of broccoli that you may want to grow you should select your cultivar based on the desired head shape size color yield and disease resistance cultivars may also differ in planting and harvest times too planting multiple cultivars that mature at different times will help you extend your season and allow for continual harvest of broccoli on the screen you'll see a few different um varieties or cultivars listed that you can select from now there's a lot more out there than what's shown here but this just gives you a little bit of an idea of some of the varieties and what their maturity might be so we're going to talk about some of the problems that broccoli deals with that maybe the other four other three plant species do not deal with i'm going to wait till the end to talk about the insect or disease pressure that all of these plants share but in terms of just looking at problems that broccoli deals with one of them is bolting and the high summertime temperatures may cause bolting in your broccoli bolting is when the plant prematurely produces flowers before harvest and can make the broccoli cat unusable if you look here in the picture you can easily see the yellow flowers popping up through the broccoli head and when you see that that's the bolting and that's when the broccoli becomes unusable you're just going to have to get rid of the plant and not really be able to harvest the produce that you were hoping to get then stress plants may result in broccoli developing buttons which are small heads on broccoli plants that are not desirable for harvest stresses that may result in button development include cold temperatures below 50 degrees insect or pathogen um pressure nutrient deficiencies so really to help prevent buttoning from occurring you need to make sure that you're selecting transplants that are healthy show no signs of disease and put them in a favorable environment that's not going to have the stressors and then as it's growing try to provide it with the right temperatures and moisture that it needs to thrive now broccoli is hand harvested prior to flowering roughly 60 days from transplanting or about 110 days from when you actually seed it harvest the head while the buds are still tight and before any yellow petals begin to show if harvested too late the stem will be hard cut the central stem five to six inches below the head many cultivars will continue to produce side shoots as long as you leave a few leaves on the plant the amount of stem you to leave on the broccoli head depends on what you're going to use it four in the case of processed broccoli we usually leave about or take off six inches of stem well if you're doing a fresh broccoli that you're gonna sell on a harvest mark a farmer's market you may want the stem to be a little bit longer now those side shoots i said may develop after you harvest the main head um they will slowly develop along the sides they'll be smaller so you'll have to pay attention to them but they can be harvested and used for produce too and you can continue to harvest those smaller heads until the freezing or weather causes it to stop developing them now broccoli it can keep for about 10 to 14 days if you're storing it properly which means you have the correct temperature and humidity in the location that is being stored so now that we've talked about brussels or broccoli we're now going to switch gears over to brussels sprouts and you may be thinking well you're calling it the wrong name it doesn't need that s in there after brussel but it really does because brussels sprouts is named after the city of brussels belgium where the vegetable first became popular brussels sprouts are a cool season vegetable that can be grown both in the fall and early spring they also take a long time to mature which can make them a little bit challenging for the home gardener for ease of growth select and use transplants that are young and vigorous so once again if you're going to go out and buy those transplants from a big box retail store or garden center look at them be very careful to make sure that you're buying something that's healthy and got the right maturity at that point in this growth stage it brussels sprouts is a hearty biennial that is actually harvested at the end of the first season for its enlarged buds at the base of the leaves that are called sprouts and you can see them in the photo shown here now you want to plant your seeds about a quarter to a half an inch deep germination is best once again when temperatures are between 70 to 80 degrees fahrenheit and seedlings should appear in about five days you want to grow your seedlings in a little bit cooler temperature so about 60 to 70 degrees fahrenheit and they should be ready to transplant in about four to five weeks you may also want to purchase or could purchase transplants from a store if you would like now spring plantings are not necessarily successful in indiana because um the fact that if we plan them in the spring the temperatures are constantly increasing whereas if we wait and do for a fall harvest of brussels sprouts the temperatures are declining and that helps with the growth of the plants so this vegetable really does need a long growing season in cool weather for those buds to mature so if you try to do a spring planting you really need to get those transplants out early in march or early april summer plantings that are made for a fall harvest are much more common in indiana because our temperatures are decreasing as summer fades into fall so have plants in the ground in early july for northern indiana and then about mid august for southern indiana you should plant brussels sprouts 15 to 18 inches apart with about 30 inches between your rows if at all possible now brussels sprouts require a minimum of six hours of sunlight a day they prefer fertile well-drained organic soil but will tolerate a wide range of soils brussels sprouts grow best in soil that is 6.2 to 6.8 p soil ph if planting in the spring when the soil is still cold then you're probably going to want to give it some starter fertilizer to help it get to growing and then you need to make sure that your plant receives about one to one and a half inches of water a week you really want to irrigate brussels sprouts frequently enough to keep the soil lightly moist particularly when the weather is really warm and the plants trying to develop you can also mulch around your plant with stroller wood chips to help conserve soil moisture and also reduce weed competition now about three weeks after you've transplant your brussels sprouts into the ground you may want to consider side dressing them with some fertilizer once again you'd want to use about point one pound of actual nitrogen per 100 square feet and when you go to side dress your brussels sprouts like many plants there are several different varieties to choose from varieties such as jade crossy long island improved prince marvel and valent have a 90-day maturity rate jade crossy has large sprouts and is easy to harvest long island improved is open pollinated and considered an old-time variety of brussels sprouts royal marvel has an 85 day to maturity rate is very productive and has tight sprouts so we really just want to give you some ideas of a few different varieties or cultivars that you can select from and make sure you're reading the label to see which one best fits your needs and will harvest when you wanted to so let's talk about some of the problems that you might have with brussels sprouts the big one deals with temperature um if temperature gets too warm brussels sprouts become bitter in contrast the frost helps improve the flavor makes them more firm and less bitter they will honestly withstand a frost and harvest continues until it freezes so on it is a really good idea to put them in the ground in that late summer time and let them mature as temperatures are decreasing because that frost in the fall is going to help them taste better be firmer and more ideal of what you really want them to be like whereas if you have them as a spring planted crop they're going to be growing and being ready to be harvested when our temperatures are really warm because we're in the summer and that's going to cause those brussels sprouts to have more of a better taste now the first sprouts will be ready to harvest in about 85 to 90 days from transplanting depending on the variety the lowest bud matures first with a new bud firming as the plant continues to grow upward now you want to pick the buds or sprouts when they're about one to two inches in size as you harvest each of the sprouts remove the leaf below it if possible however you might want to leave a few of them on there when you go to actually harvest the sprouts reach in and lightly twist it as you pull it off that will help it remove easily and prevent it from like splitting or breaking and make it so that you can use it for what you want to do now you can store brussels sprouts in the refrigerator until you're ready to use them or they can also be frozen and used at a later date now we're on to talking about our third plant for today and that one is cabbage cabbage has been cultivated for more than four thousand years it is a popular in many dishes around the world is high in dietary fiber iron vitamin c vitamin k folate manganese and other important nutrients cabbage is a hearty biennial harvested in the first season for its terminal cluster leaves that we refer to as a head now seeds are usually started indoors for a spring harvested plant seeds germinate in about four to five days when the temperatures are about 70 to 80 degrees fahrenheit indoors in spring you can plant the transplants outside about two to six weeks before the average last frost date and continue until the very early april in southern indiana and into may in the coldest part of the state if growing from seed start the seeds about five to six weeks before you plan on putting them outside now with transplants you need to make sure they're stocky and they have about four to six true leaves on them now you may wonder what's a true leaf and when a ceiling first emerges from the gr from the soil the first leaves that come out are usually their cotyledon leaves and then the next set of leaves are true leaves a good example of this is if you think about a tomato plant if you've got some tomato seedlings you'll notice the first leaves don't really look like those tomato leaves that we're all familiar with so those do not count on how many leaves you have on this evening before you should put it outside with cabbage we again we want four to six true leaves um and you want it to be about the the stem to be about the size of a pencil if your transplant has less than four to six true leaves then it may be more sensitive to the cold temperatures and then if they have more than six leaves then it may be too mature and produce an inferior crop and begin to flower prematurely now plants should be planted about 12 to 14 inches apart with rows about 18 inches apart for a fall harvest plant transplant 7-9 weeks before the average first frost date this would be about mid-july in northern indiana in late august in southern indiana cabbage is quite cold tolerant so you may be able to harvest after those dates though you can start these plants by putting the seed directly in the ground since it's already warm the soil is warmed up and the seeds should be put in about a quarter to a half an inch deep or you could buy transplants and put them outside too if you don't want to directly seed the cabbage into the soil cabbage grows well in fertile well-drained moist soil with plenty of organic matter soil ph should be maintained around 6 to 6.8 for optimum growth this range of soil ph will maximize nutrient availability and discourage crab club root which we'll talk about later mulching around the plants will help keep the ground cool and moist cabbage has a shallow root system so tilling near plants may cause harm provide consistent and adequate water when needed so it needs about one inch water per week now when planting in the spring and the soil is still cold you might want to provide it with some sort um starter fertilizer if you don't or if you want to also provide some type of side dress you can do that about three weeks after you put the transplants outside and to side dress you'd only use about 0.1 pound of actual nitrogen per 100 square feet now with cabbage you really want to select cultivars based on the desired head size and color resistance to splitting time and time to material charity early maturing varieties may not stir store as well and are more prone to splitting while longer season varieties store more easily and are more commonly used for sauerkraut if that's what your ultimate goal is now of the varieties listed on here regal red is a red variety of cabbage along with red acre and ruby perfection now there are two problems that we really want to talk about or be aware with when it comes to cabbage and one of them we've already talked about that's bolting but there's also split splitting and root damage so once again with bolting that's when the plant develops some sort of flowering and oftentimes seedlings exposed to low temperatures so in the 40 to 50 degree fahrenheit range for more than two weeks may develop flowers and begin to bowl so it's best to wait until the soil has warmed to 40 degrees fahrenheit before transplanting to help prevent this from occurring now cabbage does need a constant steady growth for best health head development water if rainfall is lacking to help the head develop correctly when the head grows too rapidly it may split this can occur when you have a dry spell that's then followed by a lot of rain or when the weather is so warm that stimulates rapid growth to slow down the growth and prevent splitting you can grab the um developing head and give it a light twist to sever some of the roots because once again like i said they have a very shallow root system so it's easy to kind of break a few of them if you don't want to hit and grab the head and twist it you can also take a little spade and kind of cut some of those roots off and that will slow down the group the growth and prevent the head from splitting now because the roots are shallow it works to your advantage when you're trying to prevent splitting from occurring but it could be a disadvantage if you've got some weed pressure and you're going to be tilling around that the cabbage or using a hoe or a spade to get rid of those you need to be really careful because when you do some weed removal you can easily damage the roots and possibly kill the plant so be careful with weed control maybe consider doing some hand pulling if at all possible or mulching around the cabbage plant so that you can prevent root damage associated with weed control now you want to um harvest cabbage when the head is solid you harvest by cutting the stem immediately under the head leaving the loose outer leaves smaller heads that are about two to four inches may grow at the base of those leaves on that cut stump allowing for a second smaller harvest to form and develop for you to enjoy cabbage can be stored in a refrigerator for several weeks or up to five months if the temperatures are correct and it's got the right environment which means you need a lot of humidity for storage of cabbage the final plant we want to talk about is cauliflower and it is a hardy biennial the name cauliflower comes from the latin collis and flores which translate into cabbage flour nutritious and cauliflower colorful cauliflower can be found in vegetable and ornamental gardens the head called the curd is made of dormant flower buds the curd is usually white hybrids between broccoli and cauliflower are available with purple and green heads purple cauliflower tastes like broccoli if it's harvested before frost but if you harvest it after a frost it tastes like cauliflower so that's kind of a unique talking point about cauliflower to think about how the hybrid changes or taste different depending on when you harvest it now for spring plantings you really want to put your transplants in the ground two to three weeks before the average last frost date after the soil has warmed to 50 degrees fahrenheit do not plant so late that the curd matures in the heat of the summer if growing from seed you'll want to start the seeds five to seven weeks earlier now transplants should be smaller than four inches in height and have at least three to four pairs of true leaves on them if they are smaller then they may be sensitive to frost and end up dying so if you think there's not they're gone they're too small and might succumb to frost damage try to cover them up in the evenings to prevent the frost from hurting them now you need to space your plants 18 to 24 inches apart with rows a minimum of 24 inches apart for heart fall harvest plant transplant seven to nine weeks before the average first frost day put the transplants further apart than previously mentioned you can sew the seed directly into the soil since it is warmer if you would like and at that point you need to make sure that you allow about five to six days for the seeds to germinate now cauliflower grows well in fertile well-drained moist soil with plenty of organic matter it prefers earth a soil ph between 6 and 6.8 when planting in the spring when the soil is still cold utilize a starter fertilizer if at all possible to help the plant get established you can once again side dress it with 0.1 actual pounds of nitrogen per 1000 or 100 square feet about three weeks after transplanting and that's when you're really going to see that rapid growth stage occur now this is another one of the plants that you might want to consider mulching around so you can help keep the ground cool and moist also it's like cauliflower um or it's light cabbage in the sense that it has a shallow root system so having that mulch around it will help control with weeds and help prevent you from damaging the root system you should select the variety of cauliflower you want to grow based on the curd size color if it's self blanching and it's time to maturity now of the one shown here on the screen i will mention that um cheddar is an orange variety of cauliflower and queen violet is a purple variety of cauliflower now cauliflower is considered to be more difficult to grow than other cold crops is not as tolerant to heat cold or drought any factor that interrupts its growth can cause problems if growth is interrupted the plant may button button again is a small hard inedible head this can be caused by using overly large transplants crowding transplants in small containers cold temperatures lasting several days a dry spell or a lack of nitrogen fall crops are usually more reliable because the chance of cold temperatures soon after planting and chances of hot weather is lower now if temperatures are above 80 degrees fahrenheit during curve development leaves may begin to form in the head and the head may become rough in texture have a purple or green color to it or simply not form at all and those discolorations or those leaves really makes that curd undesirable and unusable so you once again you really want to make sure that that curds forming when the temperatures are still cool enough now blanching is another thing that you have to consider with cauliflower once the curd is about two to three inches in diameter you're going to want to take those leaves that are at the bottom of it and pull it up around it and tie it together and you can see that in that picture that act of tying it together and covering that curd so light doesn't penetrate it is called blanching and you need to do that in order to keep that curd from changing collars because you really want it to be as white as possible so the tighter you get that those leaves around the less light that penetrates the better um now there are some varieties of cauliflower that are considered self-blanching so their leaves will actually do that but the only problem is sometimes that self-blanching variety may not close tight enough around the curd and sunlight can still penetrate it so even if you get a self-blanching variety use some caution evaluate it see if it's really covering the curd or not if it is not provide some assistance by tying those leaves around the curd and making sure no sunlight penetrates it now you want to see keep the leaves tied around there until the curd reaches about six to eight inches in diameter which can take three to four days in warm weather now harvest cauliflower after the curd has turned white and reached mature size harvest cauliflower by cutting below the head with a sharp knife include a few leaves with the head since they will help hold it together now unlike block broccoli and cabbage you won't get smaller um shoots or smaller curds develop after you harvest the head you're only going to get that one head so it's okay once you've harvested it to get rid of the plant um cauliflower can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two weeks if it's provided the right environment now we talked a minute ago about self blanching cauliflower and the picture here on the screen shows you a self um blanching um variety and you can see the leaves are trying to wrap around that curd they're just not getting there all the way so you would want to provide some assistance so now that we have talked about each one of these crops individually how to get them started when's the best time to grow them and talked about harvesting varieties and even a few of the basic problems i do want to talk about some of the common problems that they all face and insects and pests are a problem that they do deal with and you have to become um familiar with them and so we've got a few of the main ones on the screen aphids they feed on the plants you fluid and convector viruses severe aphid infestations will wilt and exhibit stunning growth if the plant survives you want to control by encouraging the presence of natural predators and using insecticides that do not harm natural predators populations over fertilization of some plants can increase the severity of an aphid infestation now there are several different caterpillars that can impact these four plants and caterpillars cause more injury on young plants and but they can also be found on older ones that are getting ready to be harvested a lot of times we don't realize we have a caterpillar problem until we see those big chunks bit out of the leaves like shown on some of these pictures here you really want to control all caterpillars in about the same manner essentially find the caterpillar remove it crush it or if you don't want to crush it put it in a bucket of warm soapy water and he'll end up dying um you can use insecticides to control them but you really got to make sure that the caterpillar is young if you're going to do that and of course with any insecticide read and follow all label instructions now if the caterpillar is too mature so if it's longer than a half an inch then it's going to be difficult to control with an insecticide so that physical removal is a really good idea here we also have the feed a flea beetle and it will eat foliage and you can see it's much smaller holes than what we saw with caterpillars there's a lot of or several different organic options or traditional insecticides that can be used once again regardless of what type of insect you're dealing with begin by getting it identified what's causing the problem extension educators are there to help and help you identify them but if you would decide to use an insecticide make sure that you're trying to use it when you're not going to hurt beneficial insects and that you read and follow all label instructions on how to use it because the label of the insecticide is considered the law so we now want to shift gears and talk more about diseases and there are a number of different diseases and bacterial issues that these plants can face a few of the common ones are shown here on the screen black clay starts out as inconspicuous small circular dark legions on infected plants the spots gradually enlarge becoming well defined with a gray center filled with numerous black pimple-like spore bearing structures it eventually destroys the fibrous root system and results in death of the plunium black rot is a bacterial disease the cotyledons of infected plants become water soaked and then shrivel and drop off on true leaves the infection generally appears as a yellow v-shaped area along leaf margin and then club group is a fungal disease infected plants wilt in the middle of hot sunny days and leaves turn pale green to yellow eventually infected plants will permanently and die roots will be enlarged and have spindle shaped galls or clubs on them like shown here in the picture once you pull up the plant now to reduce the impact that diseases may have on your plants begin by selecting um transplants that are healthy that show no signs of disease um you know make sure you're being selective on what you purchase or what you grow and then um you know practice crop rotation some of these diseases can overwinter so it's really a good idea about every two to three years to keep rotation of your plants so they're not in the same spot for several years in a row and if you would decide to do any um fungal applications to control these problems uh make sure you're following all label instructions on how to do this and then when it comes to watering water at the base of the plants avoid getting water on the leaves if at all possible if you do water and the water gets on the leaves make sure you're watering earlier in the day so that the leaves have time to dry before temperatures get colder so just some basic plant care can really go a long ways in making sure that your broccoli brussels sprouts cabbage and cauliflower production is successful each year now as i said at the beginning of this program that us extension educators are very um happy to be offering this educational series to everyone and we really are here to help you along the way as you grow your different items in your garden this year and even into the future so please don't hesitate to reach out to us we can help identify problems that you may be having and give you suggestions on how to treat those problems if we do not know ourselves what the problem is we can reach out to our fellow educators across indiana to find out the solution and if we still can't figure it out we can always submit a sample to the purdue pest and plant diagnostic laboratory there is usually a fee with submitting a sample to that but it's very nominal in the long run so once again if you have any questions or concerns in this upcoming year about growing your different plants in your gardens feel free to reach out to all of the fellow educators that you see on the screen or if you're not in one of our counties feel free to reach out to your local one or one of us we hope you have enjoyed today's program if you have any questions don't hesitate to contact us thank you you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsYXz797698,zsYXz797698,"Hey there, viewers! Do you like eating broccoli? Most people have a love-hate relationship
with cruciferous veggies, especially broccoli! But this video will make you rethink your
relationship. This green veggie comes with truckloads of
benefits. In today’s video, we’ll be discussing
what happens to your body if you eat broccoli every day. It sure gives you lots of nutrients and antioxidants. But can it give you younger looking skin? What about your oral health? Can it boost your heart health? We’ll be talking about all of these AND
more... 1. You Will Get Lots of Antioxidants
Broccoli comes packed with important antioxidants that help maintain your health. Antioxidants are necessary to fight off the
free radicals in your body. If there are too many free radicals, it can
cause a number of illnesses. Wondering how? Well, free radicals cause cell damage. Broccoli is rich in a specific compound, which
turns into a very effective antioxidant called sulforaphane. Various studies have shown that sulforaphane
offers several health benefits like reduced blood sugar and cholesterol. It also brings down your chances of facing
oxidative stress. Oxidative stress causes several health problems,
chronic illnesses, and premature aging. To get the most out of broccoli, it’s best
to steam it and eat. You can also boil or microwave it, but you
will lose most of the nutrients. It can also be eaten raw. Broccoli soup isn’t bad either. My favorite thing to do is saute broccoli
and tofu together. Sprinkle black salt and pepper powder, and
your delicious broccoli tofu salad is ready! How do you like to eat broccoli? Do you eat it raw, steamed, fried, or microwaved? Share your preferences with the Bestie community
in the comments below. 2. Your Heart Will Become Healthier
When the amount of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides in your body increases to a more than acceptable
level, it’s bad news for your heart. LDL is more popularly known as “bad cholesterol”. Broccoli can help reduce both LDL and triglyceride
levels. In one study, participants who were given
a broccoli sprout supplements saw a significant decrease in both LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. At the same time, there was a major increase
in HDL, also known as the “good” cholesterol. Broccoli is also rich in fiber, which is another
factor that helps bring down the risk of heart disease. Research has shown that antioxidants in broccoli
can reduce your chances of a heart attack. 3. You Will Stay Young For Longer
We all want to stay young for as long as possible. But the reality is that we all age. This is usually the result of oxidative stress,
and metabolism slowing down. While you can’t stop the aging process,
your diet can slow it down. The sulforaphane will increase the antioxidants
in your system, making them more effective. Looking for answers on all the latest health
and wellness news? Hit that “subscribe” button, and join
our millions of followers. Stay up to date on all our great Bestie content… 4. You Will Get Loads Of Nutrients
Broccoli comes with a wide range of vitamins and minerals, and is packed with fiber. One cup of raw broccoli, which weighs around
91 grams, comes with more than your daily requirement of vitamins C and K. This portion of broccoli also comes with 6
grams of carbs, 3 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber. It only has 1 gram of fat. Broccoli also has folate, potassium, phosphate
and selenium. 5. You Will Be Protected Against Cancer
Certain chronic diseases like cancer work by damaging your cells. But vegetables like broccoli have some bioactive
compounds that reduce the damage caused by these diseases. Research shows that eating broccoli can protect
you against cancers like breast, prostate, stomach, colorectal, kidney and bladder. This is all the more reason to start eating
broccoli. Before we move ahead, here’s another video
you might like. Watch and learn more about about the 7 ways
to naturally boost your immunity. 6. Your Blood Sugar Will Lower
Another advantage of eating broccoli on a regular basis is that it helps control your
blood sugar levels. This is especially helpful for people suffering
with diabetes. While it’s not yet known how exactly broccoli
does this, high antioxidants may be a reason. In one study, participants with type-2 diabetes
who ate broccoli sprouts every day for a month showed a significant reduction in insulin
resistance. Broccoli’s fiber is also shown to reduce
your blood sugar and control your diabetes. 7. Inflammation In Your Body Will Be Reduced
Broccoli also has a number of bioactive compounds, which are key to bringing down inflammation
in your body. These bioactive compounds will either work
together to make this happen, or do the task independently. This is due to anti-inflammatories. In one study among smokers, participants showed
a reduction in inflammation markers when they ate broccoli. Of course, this doesn’t mean you keep smoking
and expect broccoli to undo the damage. 8. Your Skin Will Be Safe From Sun Damage
Due to all the damage in the ozone layer, you’re over-exposed to the sun’s harmful
ultraviolet rays. As a result, skin cancer has been on the rise. However, broccoli can act as one of your weapons
to fight the effects of increased exposure. Bioactive compounds will help protect you
against ultraviolet rays. Various studies have shown that taking broccoli
extract can reduce tumor growth caused by UV radiation. There have also been a few human studies on
the effects of broccoli against skin cancer. Broccoli extract is powerful protection against
skin damage from the sun. 9. You Will Have Healthy Bones and Joints
Broccoli also helps maintain your bones and joints. Most of the nutrients you get from broccoli
will strengthen your bones and reduce the chances of developing bone-related disorders. As I said before, broccoli is a great source
of vitamin K and calcium. These are key nutrients for strong and healthy
bones. Broccoli also has things like phosphorus,
zinc and vitamins A and C. These also work on your bones. In fact, a test tube study showed the sulforaphane
present in broccoli can even help reduce the risk of osteoarthritis. So eating broccoli as part of your regular
diet can help you avoid bone-related conditions down the road. 10. You Will Experience a Healthy Pregnancy
When you become pregnant, you’re not only eating for you, but also your baby. Needless to say, you need your nutrients. This is where broccoli comes in. It’s packed with B vitamins, with the most
important being Vitamin B9, also known as folate. Getting the right amount of folate will ensure
that your baby’s brain and spine are properly developed. Certain studies have shown that eating broccoli
can help brain development of your newborn. 11. You Will Have Better Dental and Oral Health
Eating broccoli every day will help your oral hygiene. The vitamin C and calcium can lower your chances
of having a periodontal disease. The flavonoids in broccoli can also prevent
periodontitis. Along with these nutrients, the sulforaphane
in broccoli may lower your risk of contracting oral cancer. There are indications that eating raw broccoli
may even help remove plaque from your teeth. It’s also known to help whiten your smile. If a good smile isn’t a reason to eat more
broccoli, then I don’t know what is… Eating broccoli every day is definitely beneficial
for your health. How about other foods that are super good
for your body? Have I sparked your interest? Let’s keep the conversation going with a
couple more videos, shall we? Watch What Happens To Your Body When You Eat
Garlic Every Day. You can also try our video on What Happens
To Your Body When You Drink Fennel Water. Go ahead, click one. Or better yet, watch both and learn more about

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYQKqLHvIdw,EYQKqLHvIdw,"welcome everyone to today's webinar on using hydr mulches for weed suppression and yield protection in Horticultural crops I'm Alice formiga of eorganic and this webinar will last about 45 minutes and then we'll have half an hour for questions so today I'm very excited to introduce the hydromulch research team since 2021 we've been working together on a nifa Ori funded project called mulch 20 first we'll hear from Lisa Wasco Deeter and Benjamin Weiss of Washington State University we'll hear from wakas Ahmad of North Dakota State University we will'll then hear from susette ganado of Washington State University and then finally we will hear from Project leader Greta grack of North Dakota State University who will conclude the webinar by offering some implications of This research in for um hydromulch use in Horticultural production systems as as well as potential future research directions so with that I am going to turn this presentation over to our first presenter Lisa Wasco Deeter all right well Alice thank you so much for that introduction again I'm Lisa Wasco Deeter at Washington State University and Alice already introduced the title using hydr mulches for weed suppression and yield protection in Horticultural crops I'm going to be kicking off this webinar um and I really want to highlight at the on set this is a project funded from the USDA and this is a highly collaborative project uh with the different institutions that you see listed on this slide some of the topics for this webinar we are going to provide some information with regards to the whats and the wise of hydromol we're going to talk about methods of application and what we've learned in our respective trials with small fruits as well as vegetables we're also going to highlight the economic feasibility of hydr mulches based on our research and then we'll wrap up with conclusions and some questions and discussion so let's start off with the whats what is hydromulch well hydromulch is essentially a combination of different ingredients it includes water cellulose based fibers and in our experiment you'll see that we're predominantly using recycled paper and then a tackifier which functions like a glue and helps bind those fibers and the paper together so we ultimately have a slurry that we can apply through a spray app a and it dries and it hardens into kind of like a paper mâché type material that provides some mulching functionality like the picture that you see in the lower right hand corner which is from one of our strawberry trials so why hydromulch why are we interested in this unique novel mulch alternative well for one if you're organic producer you know full well that there are very few options for Effective weed Management in organic systems and because of that a lot of organic producers rely on non-biodegradable polyethylene mulch such as black polyethylene mulch for weed suppression it also does some nice um provide some nice benefits such as promotion of crop growth however it's non-biodegradable it can persist in the environment and it doesn't remove fully from the soil so that can lead to microplastics that can contaminate our soils as well as surrounding ecosystems there are so soil biodegradable plastic mulches sometimes referred to as bdms those are really nice Alternatives there's a lot of great work on them however because of the ingredients of biodegradable plastic mulches they're not allowed for certified organic production in the United States as well as in Canada and that's because of the biobased requirement by the organic programs in both countries hydr mulches in contrast they can be made with biobased ingredients and those are organic approved they can be sprayable and we also have the ability to make them multi-functional by adding other ingredients and that's a really interesting perspective future Direction and some of the previous research has been promising and uh Dr Grim has done some of that work and will'll highlight some of our current findings um with wos taking the lead and talking about some of the trials that he's conducted in North Dakota with vegetables well C you can go ahead and take it away greetings everyone my name is vakas Samad and I'm a PhD candidate at NDSU working with Dr Greta graming um so I'll be talking about the hydromulch applicator that we used at NDSU in onion and broccoli study and then I'll explain how we prepared and apply this heral and after that I'll be focusing on the outcomes from our field studies in onion and broccoli so let's dive into it and the hatal applicator that we used for onion and broccoli study is a modification of a commercially available skid type Hydro seater as we can see in this picture it has four main components hydromulch mixer hydral spray pump spray nozzle and platform uh I'll be explaining the specification of these components in visually so the hydromulch mixer is basically a skit type Hydro seater as we can see in this top picture uh we actually use this just for the preparation or for the mixing of the hyr material uh it has a 55 gallon tank with a 2in centrifugal pump uh that is driven by a 6.5 horsepower engine uh so how does this uh hyal mixer work is that we add paper teif fire and water into this tank and with the forceful mixing of 2in pump it turns the material into a homogeneous sary form so the next component is the hydromol spray pump and uh it's a clear water 1in centrifugal pump uh that drive based on the 79cc engine uh the reason for using a smaller pump is so we can reduce uh any kind of uh extra disturbance on the soil surface and we're using this pump for the spraying of the hyals so the third component is the spray nozzle it's a 3x4 in Cross nozzle that has a 80° flat spray pattern so it can cover the surface of the raised beds uh the fourth component is the platform uh that has a three-point hitch uh to attach with the tractor and with the help of the tractor uh we were able to adjust the height of the nozzle from the surface of the planting bed so let's see the overview of how we actually prepared the hydromulch in the field hydromulch preparation and application was a two person job for us uh and we use shreded newsprint in North Dakota uh that we actually use a standard Crosscut paper shredder to shred this newsprint uh while one person actually weighs the newsprint and the other person fills the water in the tank and then we start this 2-in pump and gradually start to add the shredded newsprint into this 55 gallon tank uh while one person is working on that job um we actually what the other person focuses on the preparation of the techy fire material uh for that we filled a 55 gallon 5 gallon bucket with water and then start to mix the tackifier using this little drill uh the reason for doing that was so there is no clumps of tackifier material in the 55 gallon tank and it's thoroughly mixed with the rest of the hydromulch material so once the hydromulch material turns into a homogeneous slurry form uh we actually primed the hydromol spraying pump with the hydromulch material as we can see in this picture one person holds the hose into the 55 gallon tank and we Prime this 1in pump and after the 1inch pump is ready we adjust the height of the nozzle from the surface of the RIS beds and then we start spraying so let's look at the hydromulch application in action in this small video as we can see one person starts the spraying pump and another person is ready on the tractor uh we applied the hyal in two passes as we can see the first pass material is drying out and the second pass is being applied and we can actually notice that how smoothly it's moving and then it this spray nozzle is covering the whole surface of our raised bed with that I will dive into our field studies so the objective of these studies ised to develop and test cellulose based 100% uh liquid applied hydromulch as a biodegradable alternative to the polyethylene mulches in onion and broccoli and the hypothesis of this study was that the hydr mules will effectively spress the weeds and enhance the crop yield and quality in organic vegetable production so before I explain that how we actually choose the hydromulch formulations for our Field St IES uh our team at Montana State done some preliminary testing on the hyom mulch material and formulations and the results showed that the guarum was associated with the enhanced durability and the chamina meal had the higher rain fastness so based on those outcomes we chose our hydral formulation for the field studies uh experiments were conducted at up saraka and Fargo North Dakota for onion during 2023 and for broccoli during 24 and I will be using these abbreviations for my results so the homage formulations included Guam 3% cholina 3% Guam 6% and chalina 6% these hydromulch formulations were evaluated against the weedi check weed free check and white on black polyethylene mulch hydromulch was applied in two passes at 5,765 kg total dry matter per hectare and we transplanted onion sets and broccoli seedlings into the wet HR mulch so for these studies we collected the weed count and we counted the weeds twice during the growing season and we also determined the weat dry biomass in August 12th for the onion study and July 16th on for the broccoli study and then we also Quantified the total yield of onion and broccoli as kilogram per Hector so let's look at the outcomes for the onion field study and the picture on the left shows um the absaraka field side and this picture was taken few days after the hul application and onion transplanting so we can see how does the hydral look like and then the picture on the right side is the Fargo field side and this picture was taken right after the hul application and onion transplanting and we can see the material drying out so this first graph USS the wheat density on the x-axis so the number of weed plants per meter square and on the y axis are the treatment labels these means are presented across the site and sampling times we can notice that the polyethylene was Associated uh with no weeds so it was the best uh mulch film um while the we check has the highest number of weeds as we can see in this bar and in this picture uh all all the hydro mules were effective at stressing the weeds when we compare it with VD check uh as we noticed in this 6% guarum there are very few weeds growing in it uh while among the hydro mulches the Camina had the minimum weed expression as we notice in this picture so this graph shows the weed dry biomass as gram per meter Square on the xais and the y axis has the treatment label uh the weed check was associated with the highest we dry boms and this picture show how messy the Wy check look like and then the picture with the 6% guarum show very less amount of weed biomass growing along with the onions and all the hro mulches has performed well at expressing the weed dry biomass except the 6% chamina that was similar with Wei check this graph shows the yield for the onion on the x-axis as a kilogram per Hector and the Y AIS shows the Tre between label uh the bottom panel is for theofield side and the top panel is for the Fargo field side um the polyethylene mulch at both side has the highest onion yield and among the hyro mulches guarum formulation were the best at protecting the onion yield and if we notice in this picture uh faroy the polyethylene and the six% guarum uh showed the similar onion growth so let's dive into the field outcomes for the broccoli study on the left picture is the obser field side and the right picture shows the Fargo field side and these both pictures were taken few days after the hydromulch application and broccoli transplanting and we can notice the broccoli plants growing in there so this graph shows the wheat density as wheat plants per meter Square on the x-axis and the y axis has the treatment labels so the results for the weed density in the broccoli study showed the similar pattern as we noticed during the onion study the polyethylene had no weeds while the weed check had the highest number of weeds as we can also notice in these two pictures um all the hydr mulches were effective at expressing the weeds uh comparative to weed check and we can see that the Guam formulation we don't see any weeds in this picture and then the 6% Camina had few weeds this craft shows the weed Dy biomass on the xaxis as gram per meter square and the y axis has the polye has the treatment labels so VD Che had the highest weed dry biomass and all the hydro mulches were very effective at reducing the weed biomass as we can see in this graph and if we compare these pictures the we check is full of uh weed biomass and the guarum formulation showing uh minimum with biomass this graph shows the broccoli yield and the XX AIS as kilogram per Hector and the y- AIS has the treatment label and unfortunately we notice the yield reduction in the hydral treatment comparative to polyethylene and weed free check uh if we focus on the weed check bar uh this yield reduction is probably associated with the weed biomass that we noticed in the previous graph uh while the hydr mulches have stressed the weed biomass so this yield reduction is probably associated with some other uh parameters and we have some speculations about it um first of all we transplanted the broccoli seedlings uh into the wet hydromulch so when we spray the hydromulch we are adding a lot of water into the planting beds um and that could actually lead to the competion of the soil uh and that can stress the transplanted broccoli seedling that probably transform into the broccoli yield reduction and and other parameter is that we got a lot of rain right after the transplanting of these broccoli seedling uh so we received uh 9 to 10 inches of rain in next three two to three weeks after transplanting of broccoli and that water saturated soil would have also probably stressed the plants and that transform into the yield Direction among these hyom multes with that I will conclude these studies that the hydromulch formulations did show The Promise promising alternative results for the polyethylene and hydromulch is actually spress the weeds and reduce the weed biomass uh while the yield reduction that we noticed during the broccoli study is probably not related to the weeds um and it could be due to compressed soil at transplanting or the water water saturated soil uh due to excessive rain uh with that I will hand over to Ben Tell tell us about the hydr mching in the fruit plants hi my name is Ben Weiss I'm a graduate student at Washington State University and I'll be talking to you about the fruit trials from this project so the first trial I'll be talking about is a strawberry trial we used albian strawberry it was conducted in 2022 we did this trial at two locations at Mount Vernon Washington and at absaraka North Dakota we used a randomized complete block design with four replication in six treatments our plot Dimensions were .9 M by 4.6 M both of our mulch treatments were applied over preformed raised beds and drip tape and at both locations we applied in the spring of 2022 and then the treatments for this project or for this trial were a polyethylene film control at a 1 mm thickness hydromulch with no tackifier hydromulch with two and 6% psyllium husk and hydromulch with 2 and 6% guarum and I just want to point out that for this section of the talk anywhere you see hm I'm referring to hydr mulch then this slide shows our mulch performance so these pictures were taken in September of 2022 which is pretty close to the end of the strawberry cropping season in Mount Vernon and I want to draw your attention especially to this lower right picture and you'll notice the drip tape or drip line split the hydro mollier in that treatment that's the no tackifier treatment and I think this does a really good job of showing why we're adding tackifier to our hydromulch and the importance of tackifier so tackifier helps increase the tensile strength which is sort of the bendiness of the mulch ler and the reason we think that one split was because it didn't have tackifier and therefore was more rigid and split more easily and then to get into some data from the strawberry trial this graph is set up with weed count per 1 square meter subplot on the Y AIS and then the treatments on the xais and and we had the no tackifier and celium husk containing treatments have the most weeds uh and then the guarum containing treatments had significantly less weeds than those and finally the polyethylene film treatment had the least amount of weeds compared to all the other hydrol treatments however I'm sorry this graph is set up the same way just with yield per gram or grams per plant on the y- AIS however we didn't have changes in yield so you'll notice all of our yields were similar to one another so whether or not the greater weed pressure was there how much that actually matters to impact and yield it didn't really seem to and then similarly for fruit quality we didn't really see differences in Fruit quality and this graph is set up the same way just with titratable acidity in grams per liter pH is pH and bricks and degree bricks on the going up the Y AIS and then the treatments are in the Legend and again how much the greater weed pressure in the hydromulch treatment really matters is sort of up to interpretation but we didn't see differences in Fruit quality or yield for the strawberry trial so one of our main conclusions really our main conclusion from the strawberry trial is that hydromulch just maintained or improved strawberry yield compared to the polyethylene control we also had higher soil temperature fluctuations under hydr mulches until the canopies developed and sh the Beds which then they became very similar after that our fruit quality and plant growth was very comparable across all of our treatments and one hurdle for commercializing hydromulch in Strawberry systems is that no one has done research on how anerobic soil disinfestation would work with hydromulch we know that it's a very common practice for organic strawberry Growers so that's really the biggest hurdle hurdle to commercializing this or using this on your farm if you do indeed use Anor robic soil disinfestation and then to delve into the work I've been doing over the last two years into blueberry This research was done in procer Washington which is a very dry desert environment I used a randomized complete block design with four replications and four treatments our plot Dimensions were 1.2 M by 12.2 M The Mulch was applied over a 5-year-old certified organic blueberry planting and it we used Valor as the cultivar and it was applied in Spring 2023 and 2024 and the 2024 application was applied directly on top of the 2023 application or what was left of the 2023 application and then the treatments for this include a weedmat control and weedmat is just a woven plastic material it's made by taking little strips of plastic and very tightly weaving them together it's a very robust mulch material meant for perennial cropping systems the next two treatments are hydral with no tackifier and hydral with 4% tackifier and the reason we're interested in comparing no tackifier to 4% tackifier is that one of the findings from a previous paper was that in desert environments tackifier doesn't really have a benefit tacka fire is also the most expensive part of our formulation so if we could eliminate it that would really help the return on investment for Growers and then both of these treatments were made with Uline bogus paper which is just sort of a nondescript gray paper and it took a lot of Labor to shred it and then blend it into a hydral slurry so for our final treatment we wanted to find a material that we wouldn't have to do as much work to make into a slurry and we found a material from an Apple packing plant that's made by taking water sodium hydroxide and recycled paper and agitating it until a slurry forms this material did eliminate all of these arduous mixing steps however we realized that it did have some very significant logistical hurdles and the cost of moving around such large volumes of liquid is really just quite prohibitive so we eliminated this treatment from 2024 and for that reason I'll this treatment won't be in any of the data I'm presenting for this project I also just want to make a note here that we did get this material certified through the Washington State Department of Agriculture for use in certified organic production however there are a lot of potential contaminants in recycl paper and if you're getting recycled paper and using it in a certified organic situation you need to check with your certifier and you really should do contaminant testing it's really important you could lose your certification if you don't and then to get into some of the durability uh measurements so this graph has percent soil exposure on the Y AIS and then the month of data collection on the xais and the treatments are in The Legend and percent soil exposure Ure is just a simple measure of mulch deterioration over time it's done visually it's a qualitative measure and you'll notice the green and burgundy lines are both much higher than the purple line the green and burgundy are no tack of fire and 4% guarum respectively and they had significantly greater percent soil exposure compared to the weed map it's also interesting that the green and burgundy lines overlap and crisscross a lot and this tells me that adding tack of fire didn't really do much in this desert environment to lower uh deterioration I expect this could change if you're in a wetter environment but if you're in a very dry environment tack of fire didn't really seem to add to preventing deterioration and then these pictures just show the deterioration so the picture on the left is one of the hydromulch treatments and it was pretty common to find just large chunks missing in different places uh part of my hypothesis for this is that the tractor was catching on them in places but I can't really be sure and then on the right is one of the weed mat treatments that is very intact still and then this slide shows monocot suppression so monocot count per one meter subplot is on the Y AIS and the treatments are on the xais and hydromulch had pretty poor monocot suppression the main weeds we had a problem with were yellow nut Edge and Ry species and hydromulch had significantly more than the weed mat is a lot and then I want you to notice that the Y AIS isn't going to change between the last graph and this graph so this graph is set up the same way just with dcot count per one meter subplot and hydr mulas did suppress dcot pretty well uh they averaged less than 10 diecuts for per one meter uh transact and hydr mules did have significantly more diecuts than the weed mat control but they were low enough that at least in my opinion most Growers would find it acceptable and then this slide shows the weed biomass accumulation so on the Y AIS is biomass in grams per 1 M squared and on the x-axis are the treatments and the legend is now the CRA or the species in question and the in 2023 we had significantly more sge in the hydral treatments than the weed mat and in 2024 we had significantly more grass in the hydral treatments than the weedmap and I can't be entirely sure why this was but I have a couple of hypotheses they include that the grass could have set seed and deposited that seed on top of the hydromulch layer and then germinated and increased biomass that way or it could be that this was a perennial rise species and that the second Year's growth was just had a lot more biomass than the first Year's growth and then this slide shows yield so on the y- axis is yield in kilograms per Bush and on the x- axis are the treatments and we didn't have any significant differences in yield however this is more indicative of the field establishment and management under weedmat than it is what would happen if you establish a field with weed mat or with hydromulch and I expect you would have differences if you established a field with hydromulch due to those monocot pressures and then similarly for fruit quality we didn't have any differences but again this could change if you establish the field with hydromulch as opposed to weedmat and then some conclusions from from the blueberry trial include hydr molas maintain blueberry yield fruit quality and tissue nutrient status hydr molas did appear to suppress dcot not quite as well as weedmat but still pretty well hydr mules did not really suppress monocots especially sge and Ry grass and multi-year hydral applications could increase grass pressures and now I'll be handling it off to Dr gonado to talk to you about the economic work with this project hello everyone my name is zette gin I am an agriculture Economist in Washington State University based in pman um so let's turn to the economic visibility assessment of using hydromulch there are three important factors to consider costs benefits and net profit all compared to traditional mulch practices of these net profit is the most important factor while it is understandable to be concerned about costs it is essential to recognize that it is the net profit that sustains the business a positive net profit can be achieved when benefits outweigh the costs we are using a partial budget analysis to estimate the financial impact of switching from pulch to hydromulch based on field studies in North Dakota and Washington for organic day neutral strawberry systems this analysis focuses only on the changes that affect farm profit on the left we show the benefits of using hydromulch represented by any additional income or reduced costs compared to the Baseline of PE mulch in Washington there is no additional income from hydromulch as the field studies found no MCH effects on yield however in North Dakota yields are higher in hydromulch treatments than in P much under reduced costs we account for savings from eliminating end of season activities like removal and disposal of pulch if hydromulch material or application costs are lower than PE mulch that would also be considered a benefit on the right we list the costs when using hydro mulch under additional costs if Hydro mulch is more expensive than PE mulch it will be reflected here in this example there is no reduced income at the bottom of the table we have the net change and profit which is the difference between benefits and costs a negative value means the change will reduce form income while a positive number indicates that a change will be more profitable than the Baseline practice now um here we are looking at the data used for the partial budget analysis example let's go through the table step by step first up is the material cost um the hom much cost is based on a formulation without a tackifier the high cost material comes from an expensive source which was chosen for easier Organic certification the lowcost alternative has not been tested for hydromulch but we included it to compare how feedstock costs affect profitability for PE mulch the cost is based on using two rolls per acre each 1 M thick and 4 feet by 4,000 ft next about Libor application costs are higher for hydromulch because they include preparation for pulch labor costs also account for removal clean up and Disposal the differences in labor costs that we see in the table between North Dakota and Washington reflect the different labor rates in the states next the total yields of day neutral strawberry in the midwest range from 10,000 to 20,000 pounds per acre with 80% being marketable in North Dakota we use the lowest estimate as a baseline which is 8,000 pounds per acre of marketable yield since field studies in North Dakota showed higher yields with hydral than pulch we Ed the midpoint of the range 15,000 over all or 12,000 marketable yield to represent hydral shield and last but not least since organic strawberry price data is not available for North Dakota and Washington we use the 2023 us average wholesale price of $389 per pound in our analysis here is a graphical representation of the partial budgets in the two states given low and high material costs for hydral in North Dakota the net change in profit is positive primarily due to higher yields with hydral compared to pulch even in the high cost hydral scenario the additional income and cost savings outweigh material and application costs with a potential profit increase of about 13 $3,370 per acre in Washington on the other hand um where yield is not affected by mching practices profitability depends on input cost savings under the lowcost hydromulch scenario net profit is positive because of savings in M material and labor however in the high cost scenario net change in profit is negative because labor savings are insufficient to offset higher material and application costs resulting in a loss so when does high cost hydral become feasible hydromulch must generate at least the same profit as pulch in North Dakota this requires an additional $3,600 per acre in income or 924 pounds per acre more marketable yield at $389 per pound in Washington this condition requires an additional $3,580 per acre or 921 pound per acre more marketable yield these thresholds determine when high cost Hydro much becomes a viable alternative to p and these numbers are mainly based on the values that we use for the analysis so it can be different when we have different values what are the key takeaways in the previous slide we presented profit estimates and highlighted factors such as increased yield labor cost savings that influence profitability however the main takeaway is not the specific profit values but understanding the conditions that make hydros a competitive alternative to P it is also important to note that our current analysis is based on small scale experiments and high cost feed stocks so our results have limitations while Halal is expensive at this stage costs could decrease with larger scale production and more Affordable Feed stocks alternative feed stocks to exist that could be cheaper but they require further testing to ensure sure that they meet both performance and Organic certification requirements and moving forward our analysis of broccoli and onions in North Dakota and blueberries in Washington will consider factors such as different hydromulch formulations different feed stock costs labor rates crop yields output prices and scale of operation to refine our economic assessment well that's all I have for the economics SP thank you all right hi everyone I'm Greta gry and I'm the principal investigator for this project and I would like to give you some conclusions to wrap up this presentation some future directions this project is at its near end we will be continuing research through 2026 some of the things that remain in North Dakota we plan to test the effect of hydromulch presence in the soil on onion production so to answer a couple questions that have already been asked yes we till it in it is fully biodegradable but the presence of the hydro molch could upset the nutrient balance the carbon um has a tendency to tie up some nitrogen so that we're going to test that in a production setting but we're also testing the soil Health impacts associated ated with tilling this material into the soil and our collaborator from the USDA Sharon wires could be with us today to talk about that a lot of those measurements still haven't been um processed and analyzed so that's a component that we're still working on and as susette man um mentioned we are also still working on our economic analyses um as she mentioned as well this is a project that was conducted on a relatively small scale in relation to commercial production and so we will need to consider many issues when trying to scale up hydromulching for a a more realistic setting and also to get a better idea of what the cost would be uh we uh pretty much uh one thing that wasn't mentioned is we did a lot of tests at Montana State University and we tested some other feed stock materials U such as wood fibers and hemp herd fibers and those worked a lot less well than the cellulose um then the cellulous is also a common component of hydr mulching or hydro seeding commercial products that are available and so uh we I've been contacted by a company called profile that makes commercial hydr seeding materials and we would probably collaborate with them to develop a cellulose based product uh at some point if we got enough support for the um continuation of this idea we've also received some interest from a major Berry producer um called nature ripe and so um might be able to work with them to test the material on a larger commercial scale one thing about the tackifier so we explored using psyllium husk garum and camelina meile so the chamelin Ile is a waste product and those other two are not so it would be great to find something that was an agricultural waste product the chamina meal didn't work as well as the gar gum but but um we suspect it was due to so that's the the solids that are left over when you crush a chamina is an oil seed you crush that seed to get the oil and then the waste product is those solids we suspect that there was some remaining oil in that chamina meal that worked against its potential as ATT tackifier so we might be able to explore having um more refined uh processing of the chamina meal to make it a more suitable tackifier the guarum worked great but it's a really expensive material that we'd love to find um an alternative for um so exploring other tack fires is something that we need to do to scale this up and also we would be interested in developing alternative application methods that are crop specific so as wakas was mentioning we felt that plant ing the tender broccoli seedlings into the hydromulch may have set them back a little bit and we did work with a farmer the picture on your right shows a A system that he was working on whereby you would um plant the seedlings first using a a typical transplanter attachment and then at the bottom of the picture you can see there's two nozzles coming out that would apply the hydromulch on top of the seedlings and that may be a better approach for those kinds of tender seedlings the way we did it in our studies when we planted the crops after the hydromulch application worked great for strawberries and it worked great for onions too and so those are a number of things that we would need to look at before we scale this up and I know that people are interested in trying this them eles and we can talk about that in in the questions I saw there was a question about that um and I think I'll just stop there maybe um give uh some acknowledgments again people that helped us out with the project all of our respective institutions also mention again that this was funded by oi Grant which is a nifa grant part of the USDA and I think we'll move on to questions on this slide there are several QR codes that you can use to access um a website for the project and um the E Organics uh page and so with that we'll close it out and take some questions thanks everyone thank you Greta and thank you everyone um we'll be moving on to our Q&A I know we've got a lot of questions coming in right now so I'm just going to pull up my Q&A box here and go through some of the questions I know we've had some really great ones coming in and I'm just going to start with one of the last ones while I'm getting ready here um because um I thought it was a really funny question um somebody asked what about um using prec consumer toilet paper I live near Green Bay the toilet paper cap capital of the world or the country and lots of toilet paper is damaged during manufacturer and may be available um I know that one thing that Ben said was really important in this regard which is whatever you do use you have to get it approved by your organic certifier if you're certified granny but does anybody want to comment on that um it turns out that to manufacture to toilet paper uh the machines use forever chemicals or posos and so all of the commercial toilet paper that you use is contaminated with past and so I don't know if that would be uh potentially um useful material especially for organic use um I don't know it's probably a very small amount of posos but it would probably be something that people would be concerned about yeah we had a couple other um sort of Rel questions um we had a comment that um in Maine there's um they've had some issues with um pasas in biosolids from paper mills and um someone else was wondering about the ink content in paper utilized for Organic certification requirements yeah I can I can address that as well and this is a really interesting question that I've had some grappling with personally because years ago so I tried to get a material a mulch material made out of wool certified and my certifi is very stringent by the way and they would not let me they wouldn't approve this material because the mulch was dyed with a green soy based dye and so I didn't use it and then when we started working on this project I found out uh when we first started doing little test trials we were using virgin newsprint which would not be contaminated with ink it actually works a little bit better than the the recycled paper but then I found out that for The Organic certification we would need to use recycled paper and it is allowed in the organic standards and they don't address the ink component even though I would venture to Guess that most recycled paper will have some residual ink content and that's a good example of what I think is some discrepancy in the organic standards they're not perfect and they can sometimes be contradictory um such as the example I'm talking about uh but it it remains that recycle paper is allowed for organic um use in the United States whether or not it contains some ink residues a little bit more about the material and the development of a commercial product product we would work with a company that could produce a product with as low toxicity as possible and it would be omry labeled so that there would be at least no worries with getting certified uh but in this world I think it's very unrealistic to think that we're going to live uh free of toxic substances and so I'll leave it there thank you um okay so um we have a couple questions about the mulch in different um climates and weather conditions so um how does the mulch behave after rain in terms of it getting washed away with rain or showing cracks due to repeated drying and wetting Cycles I know that was part of the material testing but does anyone one want to talk more about that I know wakas knows a lot about that maybe he can take that one and Ben can chime in sure so actually we did get some rain after we sprayed during our onion study at one of our locations um and the material is actually it did not just wash away it was pretty resilient to the rain and it still stayed on the surface of the bed and we did get pretty good suppression for the weeds U but we do think that the rain did impact a little bit uh for the the durability of the of the material um or for the suppression ability of the material for the weeds uh but it did not completely wash away and we were still able to get pretty good suppression for the weeds cost to avoid damage altogether how many hours would you like to see that hydromulch dry before you get a rain uh so actually uh if we don't get rain and if the day is a complete sunny day uh with a temperature about 70 Fahrenheit I think it will take 3 4 hours for the material to dry out and depends on the clouds if we have clouds it can take longer for the material to dry but it it do dry pretty quick if we have a sunny day within like two three hours right so once it's dry it's actually very resistant to damage from rain in fact last year in our broccoli trial I think we had about 10 inches of rain the first couple of months it was I was about ready to start building an arc so it was it was pretty resilient to that rainfall after it dried and I want to mention another thing so any if we don't get rain we are we are actually uh irrigating the plants using the drip irrigation so that also um makes the hom mulch material um get wet after every irrigation period so uh this material is even if it is wet it still stay on the soil surface and it does it job for stressing the weeds um that's what we noticed during our study so even if we're not getting rain we still irrigating it and causing the water to actually get soaked into that material and it's wet but it's still staying on the surface and doing its job and just to add on to that um there's I've been pretty curious about what would happen to hydromulch in tropical storms in places like Florida specifically and there's research from 2006 the author's name is Warick um they did use slightly different paper hydral like their formulation was a little different but they didn't have any issues with it getting destroyed in a you know hurricane type weather either so at least they didn't report it they did so there's at least some evidence that you know it would be okay in a tropical storm um yeah we had a related question um about whether how well hydromulch might hold up in warm humid conditions such as Florida so you just mentioned the hurricane it might withstand the hurricane but what about um prolonged humidity um and um Johan who asked the question was wondering about also about the effect on microorganisms soil pathogens and nematodes um that that research was done in Florida so it it held up for them um I don't I can't really answer the other part but the research on that the pest and the soil microorganism component just hasn't been done yet and there are is some soil health work that's being done by Dr wiers and that includes some um microbial components but at this point we're not able to answer that question but because the material is predominantly cellulose it is going to degrade faster so there was a question about biodegradability and uh Greta addressed it as well but I just want to point out that it is cellulose it's one of the most fastest degrading um polysaccharide or material that can be used as a mulch so it will biodegrade um in some cases it biod degrades quite rapidly along the edges where there's contact with soil and moisture because the higher temperature combined with the moisture can cause some more rapid deterioration but on the surface it stays intact I can add to that a little uh even though I'm not aware of research that has specifically addressed various pests and pathogens we didn't notice observationally anything that would make me suspect that the hydr mulches could be a culprit or exacerbate issues like that but we do need to have some research done about that issue so good question yeah um we had another question about how much water you're putting down with the hydromulch on the plot because um Rebecca is wondering about longer term effects on soil moisture well I could talk about it a little bit there it does contain a fair amount of water that soaks into the soil I would say that it wets about the first maybe half inch of soil if it's dry and and then it's just like getting a rain it would be like getting a a light rain uh if I had to guess it would be like getting a quarter inch of rain or something like that I hope that answers your question we it the issue does sometimes complicate the transplanting a little bit but in terms of affecting the crops in terms of water use I I think it's probably NE negligible and I can also add into it so the recipe that we used for the for our H formulation we added 35 L of water to 1.25 kg of dry matter so that's what was our recipe for making the hyom formulation uh in when we talk about the ratio of water to dry matter maybe maybe at some point w cost you can calculate how much water that is going in on a per meter squared basis or something like that that's something we haven't calculated okay um we have a question about whether this has been done on a smaller scale application um because um seoa says um she doesn't have the the scale of equipment that you had so are there any smaller ways to apply hydromulch that you know of that might be done on a smaller scale yeah so prior to getting this grant I worked on a smaller Grant where I tested these ideas on a much smaller scale and we use uh we still mixed the material using this commercial Hydro seater has a really powerful pump but I have thought about using a commercial immersion blender I think that you could Shred the paper and then use an immersion blender to blend it up and then in this smaller trial what we did was we used a backpack sprayer I don't know if you're familiar with a solo backpack sprayer but there's others that are used for spraying herbicides or other liquid treatments in agriculture but it's a manual um backpack sprayer that's pressurized with a hand pump and we just use that to you know kind of manually apply the hydr mulch to the soil surface and on a really small scale if you want wanted to try it out that would work I it would be more difficult to achieve a really even application with that methodology but that's an idea for how someone could try it on a smaller scale also just to add a little onto that um we were mixing it by hand for our blueberry trial and we found the the easiest tool to use was a grout mixing drill and a drywall attachment um and it is pretty laborious but it is also it works and you can blend up a you know 40 gallon trash can of it in maybe 15 minutes um assuming the paper's already shredded okay great we have lots of questions coming in still and we still have another 15 minutes or so so this is a great discussion um okay so another question about news okay with newsprint becoming the 21st century dodo bird and the toxic potential with recycled paper any thoughts on materials like sawdust which um which was tested and or chopped straw or other materials I know Greta mentioned cellul there's lots of previous studies about this and people have used wheat straw uh rice Hull spent mushroom cultivation substrate and any number of um organic materials cellulosic materials the the straw um sawdust wood fibers tend to not stick together very well that's one of the virtues of the cellulose or paper based fibers they um tend to form a more cohesive layer uh but I think that it is possible that we could work with as I mentioned before a a company that specializes in developing these sorts of products and they would be able to for one thing access materials on a scale that would bring the cost down and also work to get the material arm relabeled so that it would be as clean as possible but I again in in this day and age I don't know if you're ever going to be able to achieve something that's 100% free of any type of contaminant and so that that would be nice but I I don't know if it's realistic did anyone try organic rice holes yeah there's a paper that uses that material we did not because rice is not uh something that's grown around here I I think generally people are looking ideally it would be great to use a material that's locally available as a agricultural waste or byproduct okay um I just want to um read the answer that susette um wrote to Enrique who had asked about the costs um so susette wrote that um currently we only have estimated the per acre cost of material and application in organic strawberry depending on the hydromel formulation the cost ranges from 4,000 to 9,000 per acre and the high cost is mainly because of the expensive feed stock used in our field studies and the smallscale experiments we will look at conditions that will decrease this cost in our ongoing economic analysis so stay tuned so yeah um on this page you can also see the link to our project website so we will be posting future Publications and articles and you can see the ones that have already been there on this website if you want to learn more so um on with more questions here does this system assume a tilled weed-free field did you test results on a field with established tough weeds like Fescue uh no you we are we we were using raised beds to make those beds you would till them first and then build the bed with a Bel a bed shaping attachment uh there may still be propagules some of the studies that we conducted still had propagules of Canada thisle and that's going to be one that it does not help with that very much if you've got perennial weeds that are growing from Vegeta propagules those have a lot of energy and uh force behind them as they REM uh emerge and so a lot of those tougher weeds I don't think that it's going to be that successful okay does anyone else have a thought about that yeah um in the blueberry trial in procer it's a 5-year-old planting so there were uh diesel plants trying to grow through from the alleyway to some degree I noticed um it did seem like it suppressed them to some degree but not entirely and then it's also my hypothesis for part of the reason we had such issues with uh sge and Ry is that they were you know already present in the beds and then had the energy to grow through and you know assuming it was perennial R they're both perennial weeds in Eastern Washington okay um so a couple um questions about transplanting so just to clarify did the mulch dry out before transplanting the strawberry for a few hours or for another day in general we used to in in North Dakota anyway we use two passes and a lot of times we would apply a pass on one day and then the next day another pass and I would say that the material was still damp but not completely wet when we transplanted we did another study uh with another Grant and for that study the mulch was dry when we planted into it and we used a drill with a circular hole drilling attachment to just punch holes it's pretty hard when it dries but that was also successful using this um whole puncher but I I think that it would be better to plant into it when it's still not quite fully dry or plant and then apply it on top of your planting which is something that we worked on a little bit but weren't able to fully assess yeah that was kind of the next question which was doesn't transplanting after application disturb The Mulch and expose soil for weed germination yeah it just depends on the crop and that's why when I was talking about refining application methodologies I think for some crops it would be better to plant first and then apply the hydromulch but for something like strawberry the the bare roots are inserted we used have a little tool that looks like a a metal um little metal rod a flat piece of metal rod and it the hole that it makes in the mulch is Tiny and so it doesn't really expose that much soil um around the plant itself and the same was the case for the onion just depends on the crop okay great thank you um let's see um a couple one more comment here um just about the the person who asked about the um Fescue Fields um she doesn't think it's necessarily feasible to do that wild blueberry Fields where perennial weeds abound and that's probably true um and then um we have another question from Johan I know this is an organic seminar and part of an Ori Grant but it would be interesting to look at this in conventional a which accounts for the majority of plastic mulch used yeah that's a a great comment and as I mentioned in my concluding comments I have had conversations with the head of research at nature rpe which is one of the biggest Berry producers in the US and they are they were interested in triing it not just in organic but they also have non-organic systems the big problem though is that the plastic mulch in the conventional systems is also used in conjunction with soil fumigants and the plastic is integral to hold those fumigants in and I suspect that the hydro would not work quite as well for that so there would be some issues in trying to um mesh all those different functions together but the work hasn't been done and so that would be another area that could be explored great um okay we have a last comment here about maybe spraying hydromulch and transplanting at the same time would work for some vegetable crops and I know that that was attempted and have some videos on our website um from a couple years ago um which show an attempt at doing and I already talked about that we worked with a farmer he had a trans a twers transplanting rig on his tractor and also a hydromulch applicator and it would move along and in one pass the people would plant the tender seedlings I think we were using a a baras of some sort and then right behind it the hydromulch came in and would apply on top of those transplanted seedlings and I kind of thought that the force of it which is not that great but there is some force from the material exiting the nozzles I thought that might damage the seedlings but they were surprisingly resilient to it and they were just fine uh unfortunately the farmer who was working on this 4S got another job and quit the project and so we were not able to fully assess that method of transplanting first and then applying the hydr mulch but I think based on what we learned in our initial trials I think it has potential great any concluding or final remarks um before we close down been a great discussion I just want to thank everyone for all these great questions and mention again that this webinar was recorded and we will have it on the E organic YouTube channel as well as on our project website and the eorganic website within the coming week and we hope you can join us next week for two more webinars one on spotted wing dropa and one on organic anerobic soil disinfestation so thank you so much Greta Ben Lisa and wakas and susette and Sharon who's not here but um she contributed to this presentation as well as D prit paja so thank you very much and um we hope to see you again thank you so much everyone thank you much thank you"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvJzFdizkzk,kvJzFdizkzk,when it comes to royalty within the vegetable Kingdom there's only one variety that wears a crown its Tinder leaves taste sweeter when kissed by a frost and the feature presentation is a nutritional Powerhouse that's excellent enjoyed fresh simmered into soups or simply roasted but growing broccoli in the South comes with unique challenges planting at the right time proactive pest control and proper harvesting techniques are essential so let's explore this garden grow nobility from C to success I'm Scott from New Garden Road always out here to inform Inspire and Elevate you encouraging biodiversity and restoring habitat is my mission one Garden at a time when it comes to planting at the right time first and foremost you need to check your local extension service for a planting guide here in my Austin Texas Garden for Travis County we can begin planting our brocc from transplants or seedlings beginning in the fall that being said if you want to plant from seed which you can and this will give you access to more varieties than you might find at your local Garden Center you're going to need to start that at the end of July or early August in most seasons I choose to buy my transplants from a local grower and this gives me a shortcut in the process because as much as I would like to start from seed I would need to be doing that indoors right because if you're in a similar growing zone you know it's very hot in the middle of summer or Late July and if you grow these seedlings outside there just going to be stressed out you're not going to be successful and when it comes to the local planting guide that I've historically reference for my timing in the garden you can also plant broccoli from transplants beginning in January I think this is a very tricky timeline to deal with because like I just mentioned we can get very warm very quickly and moreover if we're talking about 60 to 70 days or so before that broccoli Crown is ready to harvest that means you'll be pushing into the month of March potentially April and we are getting very warm at that point in time often into the '90s and that's just not going to make for the highest quality broccoli so growing in the fall and the winter has been my point of action and I think that's probably one of the safest ways to go however you do have to be ready for cold weather and I'll be going over some of my points for successfully protecting your broccoli through freezes coming up later in the video so do make sure that you understand the difference between planting from seed versus transplant this is all about timing if you planting from seed you'll need to start much earlier I find this to be one of the most common points of misunderstanding when it comes to planting our broccoli folks want to grab a pack of seeds because often times they're available at the plant store at the same time that our transplants are available and even though the transplants are what we need to put in the ground you might see that package of seeds and think I'm going to grow a bunch of broccoli and hooray for you you should and you can do this but if we are in the month of January or February you are are going to be far far behind and that hot weather is going to roll through and it is going to crush your broccoli dreams the next point of order is going to be soil preparation for this you want to employ some high quality compost preferably from your very own backyard pile this is going to be full of indigenous microorganisms it's going to be a labor of love and only really going to cost you some time but if you do need to purchase some compost you want to look for a high quality brand one that I often go to is the happy frog soil conditioner now this may come with a high price tag but you're investing in soil biology and that's going to be really important when it comes to Growing healthy plants which are more resistant to Pest and disease they'll be more nutritious as they grow stronger so it is an investment but just remember next time around you need to start that pile of leaf mold you need to get your compost pile going and you need to do that several months in advance so that it will be mature and ready to use in your garden the next thing that you might consider adding to your garden soil is an organic fertilizer I would point you to a granular organic fertilizer something within NPK ratio in the range of 464 that's got a little bit more phosphorus than nitrogen or potassium but is fairly balanced the sustain brand is one that I've used for a long time but I will say here in my garden I've been leaning more towards the use of inoculant and biology to Aid in growing my plants and I used some of my homegrown compost which I added some biochar some mushroom block substrate and the microlife multi-purpose fertilizer now this one is a little bit higher in nitrogen which is the first number that corresponds to Leafy Green Top growth which initially is a good thing and I will say that throughout the growing season I have not been Sid dressing my broccoli plants with any granular fertilizer but what I have been doing is inoculating them I made a short video about compost extract that I make with worm castings shout out to Austin worm lab you want to check that out because this is a really easy way to produce a high quality extract that you can easily apply to your garden you only need like a little bit of a mesh bag a cup of worm castings and a 5 gallon bucket and you're on your way to Growing some really strong plants so while I initially applied this directly to the roots of my broccoli transplants before I put them in the ground I also followed up up every 4 to 6 weeks by drenching them with the same mix plants and soil biology will partner together in a symbiotic relationship and this will allow the soil nutrients that are available to plants to be exchanged via these microorganisms and the plant roots and that is the most organic sustainable regenerative way to go in the garden the next thing that I want to talk about is plant spacing for your broccoli now you will need to do some translation here depending on on your garden setup but I want you to First understand that what I'm doing is planting and raised beds and these beds are all 4T wide by 8 ft long the soil depth is around 10 to 12 in I have cultivated below the soil initially and the bed frame is about 8 in tall that may give you a little bit of orientation when it comes to my method versus your planting space but keep in mind the the spacing between plants is going to be the same so what I'm looking for is 18 in between each broccoli plant all right this allows for that broccoli plant to mature they're going to get you know maybe 24 in wide sometimes even bigger than that when we get that little transplant at the nursery it looks kind of small don't be tempted to plant them closer together because they're going to need all that space you don't want them to be cramped the leaves you know are going to have a tough time they're going to be competing for lights and for nutrients and the soil so give them the space that they need to grow properly and grow healthy my strategy for planting broccoli in these raised beds has evolved over time but what I've gotten to is 10 plants in each one of these raised beds and I will do that in two rows these are centered in the raised bed but spaced 20 in apart now I'm centering these rows strategically in this raised bed so that I can allow for some interplanting on the east and west and potentially the south side of these raised beds but it also gives the plants the capacity to grow to full maturity without really going out of bounds and that will also translate to my protocols for protecting them through freezing temperatures so you can see some images from when I landed these broccoli plants and they were really small it looked like there was plenty of space to grow other things but fast forward you can see rapidly these big broccoli leaves took off really filled in the space and there wasn't much room for anything below them to get light to grow now I want to talk about how I like to stake my broccoli plants because if you look closely you might have noticed already that I've got them staked with some little bamboo pieces in there and I use some some clips that are reusable as well you want to make sure when you clip your broccoli plants you do it up high on the plant that will give you the most Integrity but I want to mention that initially after planting I didn't I didn't stake these broccoli plants at first I wanted them to get established feel some of the resistance from the environmental conditions and be strong but what happens that I've observed later in the season if we get a cold front or some strong winds this can Lodge your broccoli plants and although they will correct themselves over time and kind of curl and follow the Sun and point back up that's not really any good because what I want to achieve is upright uniform growth I think this is the best thing for those broccoli plants you know one thing that can happen is those leaves if they are left sitting on the ground you'll get some insects coming along and chewing on them but also and potentially more importantly is the ability to intercrop alongside these broccoli plants so I mentioned in my spacing technique how I like to employ some cropping on the east and west side if you ensure uniform growth habit with these broccoli plants that's going to enable you to do that successfully but if they kind of lay down and go sideways then it's going to take up some of that space and you'll honestly just be missing out on growing some of that food and here's where I also want to interject just a little snippet about intercropping and how to choose what you can grow along the sides of your broccoli because you need to be careful with this you want to choose faster producing crops generally things that produce in say you know 30 to 45 days but also crops with similar fertilizer requirements because if you're going to be employing fertilizer and you set that up in your race B ahead of time or you're following up with it throughout the growing season you need to take into consideration the needs of those crops as you choose them for instance broccoli is forming a big flower head we're we're harvesting the crown before it flowers but it needs that phosphorus to go big and strong right so if you are planting some leafy greens alongside of it which really are promoted more by nitrogen okay the first number in NPK they might not be getting the nitrogen that they need but more importantly if they're getting an excess of phos pH forus which produces fruits roots and flowers think about it we get a stretch of 80° temperatures like we are this week that can spur them to bolts right they're going to go shoot up go to flow go to seed so you want to create an equilibrium there by choosing crops such as beets carrots radishes along that order but just as well you could drop in some cool season flowers probably some low growing ones such as stock or even pansies or violas the next tip that I highly encourage you to get in tune with is monitoring for pest what you're primarily going to see in the cool season will be cabbage Loopers or the striped cabbage worms and these are going to start off really small as a matter of fact if you really get in tune with the life cycle of these pests what you can begin to see is their clusters of eggs which are really kind of flat yellowish or white in nature often covered in a mucous membrane so you might not see that it looks like a cluster of eggs it's just kind of like a little goopy thing on your leaf or somewhere on the stem of the broccoli but this is a great way to cut off these infestations of the past you can simply wipe them or smash them pull them off likewise once the caterpillars begin to emerge they are so tiny and often times translucent so you can barely see them but if you look on a regular basis actively using both hands underneath those leaves come out in the evening with a flashlight take a good look under those plants and see what you find and that will be a great resource for organically navigating these pest pressures throughout the season now I really like to rely on physical removal as much as anything because this means that I don't have to spray anything on my crops and that's that's really my goal here in this Garden I don't want to apply any even Organic pesticides honestly and I haven't done so this year and do you see some holes in the leaves my crops yes you do is is that okay with me 100% because imperfect food that's grown organically with care that's nutritionally dense grown in my backyard it just it doesn't matter also think about something like insect netting you can construct a low tunnel structure I'm going to go into more detail on that you will be able to create a physical barrier against these Ms laying eggs on your broccoli plant so case closed no infestations whatsoever ever in monitoring on a regular basis what you may start to see is some signs of trouble if you look closely because looking down on those broccoli plants you just you start to see some some spaces on those leaves that look like they're not holes but what's going on there well if you flip it over you might begin to see that it's a breakout of these these caterpillars they are so small that they can only eat half of that leaf membrane early in the stages of their development so you won't have a hole in that leaf but that can be a good indicator for you needing to take action because as they get bigger you will see holes start to develop in those leaves they'll take out whole leaves and you'll just see the rib and often times they're doing this overnight into the early morning hours and when you go out there in the middle of the day you won't see them at all they're hiding they're curled up somewhere they're they're napping they're digesting all of those broccoli leaves now this is not the worst thing in the world in most cases this isn't enough to set back your broccoli plants but with a heavy infestation it could it could deprive them of those Leaf structures which you know would reduce their photosynthesis they're growing more slowly they're more susceptible to stress so you do everything to support them and you enact some physical removal you be you be the beneficial insect or beneficial something like that now when you look up remedies for caterpillars on your your broccoli plants you're likely to see a couple of different options the first one that I noticed recently was spinoid now I think this is a heavy hitter when it comes to organic controls and it's not necessary in order to control caterpillars but you know maybe you have some other other players in there that you want to take care of and you know that's your choice but I don't think you need to do it BT or basilis dur in gensis will Target caterpillar specifically which will include beautiful butterflies so you know it's going to be a lower order control which will only hone in on those caterpillars and not harm ladybugs other chewing insects that might be benefits to you as they are predators of other Garden pests you should go with something lower lower level I don't truly advocate for spraying these controls in the garden but I do want you to be aware of them and differences and you you can make the choice for yourself I want to talk a little bit more about fertilization because earlier this season I was with a client and we were looking at their cauliflower and broccoli plants which will have the same fertilization requirements something a little bit higher in phosphorus to encourage that that big head that we're thereafter what we saw was huge green plants and my first thought was they're getting more nitrogen than anything else because they have beautiful huge leaves which they looked super healthy they looked really really good but it could be important to note that at some point in the season right we want to have the right nutrients going to our broccoli plants I think that if you set up a healthy soil with organic matter and biology the needs for organic fertilizer are diminished greatly maybe you don't need to fertilize but take this into consideration as those heads begin to form and you're just thinking I don't know I want them to size up I have one trick that I want to share with you and that is my friends at Neptune's Harvest fish fertilizer I've been using this one for over a decade in my garden it's a concentrated liquid fertilizer they take these fish straight from the dock and they they process them without you know anything any harsh chemicals at low temperatures you're getting a highquality nutrient Rich product and this is going to have just enough phosphorus that if you're you're ready for those those heads that are starting to form to get to get bigger feed them some Neptune's Harvest because that is like dynamite for these broccoli plants whether it's cabbage cauliflower uh you know you're you're going to get a lot of bang for your buck if you choose Neptune's Harvest in that so that can be something to help push them at the right time and another thing that is really important to consider is the watering needs as those heads begin to form you want to make sure that you're providing the right amount of moisture on a consistent basis I'm not saying you need to water them heavily drench them but make sure they're getting the water they need the soil should always be allowed to dry out slightly in between waterings and I use my finger to check on the watering needs of my plants get in tune with that soil that's really the best thing to do but as those heads form it is really critical if you let it dry out or conversely if you you get too much water in there that's going to inhibit the rate of development for that broccoli Crown so we've been keeping our eyes on the prize this whole time that broccoli Crown that's like a trophy in the garden you know it's coming right it's it's forming you're you're wondering when is it ready to harvest this is probably one of the biggest questions for many of you out there and I want you to take into consideration this all right when that broccoli Crown starts to get bigger and bigger you look at it it's really kind of tightly formed all those little you know broccoli flowers are young there's in those little beads of broccoli in that head they're they're really close together and that's what you want to be keenly in tune with because as they start to to grow out and get looser you start to see some unevenness in the broccoli heads then you'll know that those flowers are getting closer to opening and emerging it's a balancing act here you want to get them at just the right time and think about it the broccoli crowns in their size they will vary between varieties but they'll also vary between Gardens between Seasons so even if the seed package or the plant tag tells you that the broccoli Crown gets 6 to 8 in it might not you need to look at the the texture and the composition of that broccoli Crown in order to know when you should pull the trigger and harvest and I also also want to offer you this one little tidbit because as those broccoli crowns begin to form if you get some rain or you're doing some overhead watering which I always encourage drip irrigation you know watering slowly on the soil directly if that water accumulates on that crown of broccoli you get some pooling there is it can be really beautiful but if it sits there for an extended period of time it can cause some rot or some Decay to start to form on your broccoli Crown so after a good rain I'll come out in my garden and I'll give my broccoli Crown a little bit of a shake you know maybe a little bit of a few bumps on the side knock off that water and then we're all good and when you're ready to harvest I recommend using a sharp knife something like a serated kitchen knife I've got a really old one that I don't I don't use inside anymore but it's great for cutting broccoli crowns because that's a pretty big stem usually my Bypass pruners or my garden shears aren't enough to do the job they just just don't really get in there and you you might have to take several angles to get that to cut off which you can do but a seriated knife works like a charm and along with that make sure you do it at an angle right you don't want to do it flat across because just like I talked about water pooling on the top of the broccoli Crown itself water can pull on the stem and we don't want that to happen because that can cause some some rot or some disease or some mold or something of that nature and you might think oh well I'm done right I grew my broccoli Crown well no you can get broccoli s shoots vegan drumsticks this is this is really the best thing you know I mean I love the trophy of the broccoli Crown but those side shoots you can get three or four rounds sometimes and they're really tender and delicious and why not make the most of this crop that you've been growing caring for over several months potentially navigating you know late summer heat midwinter freezing temperatures get out there get to the finish line and then keep on going as long as you can also that Crown the stem there a lot of food in that so don't don't neglect that don't skip that part because that's really good for you so we've covered a lot of details in this video about how to grow your broccoli successfully in Central Texas and similar growing zones here in the South but I want to tell you there are some specific techniques that I've employed over the years to protect my brocc through freezing temperatures now this broccoli here is a cold tolerant variety you know many times the upper 20s it's going to survive just fine but it really depends on the depth and duration of those temperatures as well as the windchill so with all those variables I think it's advisable to protect your broccoli plants if you're expecting some freezing weather some winter precipitation this is going to provide some continuity of their growth and development because what I observe after I take off my my Frost cloth my row cover is that my my broccoli plants have grown all right now some details here to pass along to you I like to employ low tunnel hoop structures these are specifically designed to work with my raised bed so take into consideration your garden design your layout I like to create uniform applications that are just easier to replicate from one season to the other that's why my beds are uniform in nature and I use the same system with these low tunnels whether it's shade cloth Frost cloth and for a variety of crops broccoli you know in these raised beds is going to get you know easily you know maybe 30 in tall 24 in wide I talked about the spacing under these low tunnel structures I have enough space to Encompass the broccoli plants without having the row cover sitting directly on top of the broccoli that's important you can get some contact burn if if you get some winter precipitation or some some ice crystals forming on your row cover so you want to make sure you've got something in in there to as a barrier between the the frost cloth and your broccoli plants now after an initial freeze and I've protected these broccoli plants if I get a light frost I might let it go you know it just it really depends on on the factors if if I feel confident it's just going to touch 32 and they've had a taste of it protected I think you're going to be okay but what often happens in my Austin Garden is about the time that beautiful crown is starting to form we're getting some Arctic cold fronts and I'm talking about going from 70 80° during the day to 20° during the day or maybe even to the teens for extended periods hard freezes this is not good not good at all if you've got a a beautiful broccoli Crown forming it is going to be more vulnerable than the the plant over all in and of itself so you need to take some more measures beyond that Frost Frost cover that I just mentioned to you and one of the techniques that I've employed which is very low Tech is simply taking some Garden twine or something of that nature and taking the the closest leaves to the crown and kind of folding it over almost like you would do if you were a blanching cauliflower to add an extra layer of protection around that Crown this is this is perfect uh for getting through some of these these inst es here I've done this before and along with that I have mounded up some mulch or some pine straw specifically in between my my rows of broccoli a little bit higher just again creating more layers of insulation one way or another multiple layers may be required during these events and that's what I'm getting to Here recently I employed some different techniques I had some extra Frost cloth and I simply put it directly on top of the the broccoli plant plants now I know this is counter to what I told you earlier about you know avoiding contact but it goes further than that right so I put that cloth directly on top of the plants just kind of floated it there it wasn't enough to weigh them down it was all good I I put some stones on the the end it gave them a nice encapsulated layer of protection and and always remember with this Frost cloth we are trapping ground heat that accumulates in the soil moisture and that will keep your plants warm overnight during the coldest periods yeah so along with that I put a a nice nice layer of frost cloth on top of my Hoops so I had two layers of protection for my broccoli this would mimic the you know bundling of the leaves around the the crowns of the broccoli which may be really convenient if you've only got one or two broccoli plants or a few say you could easily do that and cover them you know in that system that I described to you but if you've got a lot growing together it could be a shortcut just to take an extra piece of the frost cloth drape it on top and then put another layer on top of those Hoops so this is proven to be really effective ahead of this most recent freezing weather outbreak I just didn't feel like my broccoli crowns were sized up to their potential and they weren't because when I took all this Frost cloth off they had they had grown pretty pretty good and even since then even bigger if you're not willing to do those measures which is fine you know you decide what to do in your garden then you might be advised to go ahead and harvest your broccoli Crown ahead of some of these polar outbreaks it might not be the size that you want but if you don't want to put in all that work go ahead and get some in the kitchen and you did it you GRE from broccoli that's really kind of missing I see the fox now check out more aome gardening videos on my

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbZ7jK8kjgs,VbZ7jK8kjgs,[Music] howdy ladies and gentlemen welcome Texas with you guard my name is Jerry in this episode we're talking about how to plant roughly or specifically how to plant broccoli in C trays in the house and then an airplane transplanting the seedlings into the garden now traditionally broccoli is planted or sown directly into the garden the problem with that is there's environmental factors like the how much water is getting the sunlight and the temperature you can't control those factors as much outside as you can inside so if we plant inside we can control those environmental factors that's going to give the seedlings a good start a head start and they're gonna be healthier and the more apt to survive when we come and plant them outside the structures Prophecy's gonna need a few things you need seed starting mix like this one here just gonna need your broccoli seeds and you're gonna seed starting tray and this one here is 200 cells but you can get on the list if you don't have any seeds you want to plant also you're gonna need a pan or need to catch the water also you're going to need a something to measure the depth of the seed as you're putting it into the seed starting mix plan it and this case I'm using a small nail and I've marked one 1/2 inch from the bottom with a sharpie marker so that I know when I'm putting pushing down I get to this mark it's been a half-inch you can use also a pencil and you know a number of things just make sure you mark it so it's easy as you're going through to measure the depth of the seat so we're to start by taking that seed starting mix and dumping it out into the middle of the tray and once we do that we're gonna go from there and kind of just work your way out to the outsides of the trade pushing all of that dirt that's he's trying to mix and to get all your cells filled up in your tray you and take your broccoli cheese and you put one broccoli seed per cell just drops abruptly seed right on top just wonderful are you - no that's okay and you go through and push every seed down 1/2 inch once you filled your seat trays up with seeds and take your seeds and put them into a pan of water I have this fool about 3/4 of the way with water what that's going to do is that water is going to soak up through the seed trays into the seed mix and water our seeds once right now they look dry once I notice that they're wet on the top the the soil is wet I'm going to take this and put it back into the dry pan and set that in underneath the lights the reason I'm doing that is because we don't want to keep these seat raised in this high water environment because it will promote mold and funguses and all kinds of problems and diseases so I want to water it and then put it back in here and then set this underneath the lights once you've flanger seeds you can place them under grow lights with the timer set for 12 to 16 hours of light per day in addition to lighting you also want to place a small fan neather seedlings set to the lowest setting in order to circulate the air and prevent mold and diseases the fan should lightly blow the ceilings the movement of the seedlings caused by the fan will strengthen the stalk of the seedlings and keep them from getting tall and leggy the first two leaves that appear when the seedlings come up are called the cotyledon leaves cotyledon leaves are part of the seeds embryo and provide nutrients to the seedlings until what are known as the true leaves appear the true leaves will be any leaves that appear on the plan after the first two leaves if you differentiate the true leaves from the cotyledon leaves by noticing the true leaves have a more rigid appearance and will be larger the seedlings will be ready to transplant into the garden when they start to get their true leaves this will usually be about three weeks when it's time to transplant the seedlings into the garden you can use any long thin tool in order to make the holes to place the seedlings in before transplanting it makes it easier if you can measure the approximate depth that you are going to plant the ceiling and mark the tool with masking or painters tape you want to plant that transplant into the garden up to the base of the cotyledon leaves the transplant should be spaced 1 broccoli plant per square foot and transparence out of the individual cells in the seed trays you will need a small tool to push the transplants out from the bottom I use a 5/16 inch drill bit because it fits in the holes and my specific seed cells you can use any number of tools like a such as a pencil that will work with your specific trays once you have loosened the transplant from the bottom gently grab the leaves of the broccoli transplants and lift them out of the tray should not have to pull on the transplant if it does not easily lift out of the tray you will have to loosen it again from underneath and then attempt to lift it from the leaves again do not squeeze the stalk of the transplant while lifting as this can kill the plant gently place the transplant into the hole you made earlier and move dirt back around the transplant if you happen to have excellently planted two plans in the same seed tray simply cut or pinch off the plant that seems the least mature you can separate the two plants and grow both of them if you would like however I usually have enough plants that it is not necessary to risk damaging the plants while separating them and ending up with two suboptimal plants we're just having one healthy plant with much less risk once you have planted all the seedlings you will need to water them I like to use a turkey baster for the first watering as you can control the amount of water going on to the plants and it is easier to keep the water off of the leaves if you do not have access to a baster you can carefully use a jar to pour water near the base of the plants try not to get water on the leaves as this will promote disease I usually wait a couple of days and let the plants to adjust to the sole and then add a liquid fertilizer [Music]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5kPPW2D_Ic,R5kPPW2D_Ic,"so this is when people say that nutrients don't 
provide any benefit to microgreens this is why   I disagree how's it going everyone sees you 
from on the grill here and today I'm going to   be talking about an experiment that I'm going to 
be doing testing out different nutrients versus   just water because there's been some questions 
around do nutrients actually provide any benefit   to the growth we've done some of the tests that 
I feel like the answer is yes but I figured we'll   go ahead and start doing a few tests to show 
how just water compares against adding some   nutrients so let's talk quickly about what we've 
got here so we've got four trays of broccoli these   were all started at the same time you can see the 
germination is a little mixed here this tray over   here is definitely way behind this was I believe 
over watered in the beginning and it suffered   because of that but we're hoping that can catch 
up through adding some nutrients so we'll see   about that so every group is gonna be different 
so for our best tray over here so the growth is   best on this tray so I'm gonna make this tray our 
water group the reason I'm doing that is I want   to give water a little bit of a head start because 
I've seen how it performs against nutrients and I   know that nutrients will probably end up passing 
this so I'm gonna give it a bit of a head start   here the next tray over is going to be something 
new in our space we actually tried basically like   a worm casting tea so what we did is I took 200 
grams of worm castings I put it into a mason jar   but added some water shook it up really well let 
it sit for a little bit and I poured that into a   strainer and let the juices from it drip into a 
reservoir and that reservoir is going to act as   the compost tea for this nutrient solution so this 
one again is just worm castings and the growth is   just a little bit behind this I'd say this is 
our second best tray so I'm gonna be doing worm   castings on it for our third tray again this 
is just a little bit further behind everything   else I'm gonna be doing ocean solution because 
ocean solution is something that we've used in   our space a lot I know how to performs I know that 
it crushes it and I know that it's going to grow   really well so I'm going to put it at a slight 
disadvantage to hopefully let it beat everything   and lastly this is a combination of both ocean 
solution and the worm castings in the way that   I did it on the other one which is that 200 grams 
put in a mason jar added water stirred up poured   into a strainer filtered through and got all the 
juices out of it and so this is a combination of   both that ocean solution and the worm castings 
the reason I did on this one is because it's the   furthest behind and I'm hoping for a Hail Mary 
play here that perhaps this tray will catch up   somehow to everything else which would be pretty 
extraordinary if it did and I think that would be   a pretty solid answer on whether or not nutrients 
actually provide any benefits what I'm going to   do now is actually something I wouldn't do if I 
was trying to grow this to sell this product is   I'm gonna go ahead and introduce this to the light 
and I'm gonna go ahead and add nutrients to all of   these what I would do if I was trying to grow 
this to sell it is I would try to get these to   germinate better I'd probably leave them stacked 
for another day or to leave some kind of weight   on top but to get this kind of test rolling here 
it's already day 5 of this germination process so   I'm gonna go ahead and just toss these straight 
into the light on this shelf right here and add   their specified nutrients I will give you guys an 
update day-by-day and talk about what's happening   as we go along so stay tuned for that today 
is day 14 of our broccoli nutrient test and   as you can see I think that nutrients may play a 
factor in the overall growth so let's start with   a comparison so starting over here this is our 
water tray remember in the beginning on day 5   of this grow this tray had the best growth this 
was ahead of everything and it looked like it   was going to win so here's where it's at today it 
looks pretty decent we don't yet have true leaves   the cotyledons are pretty small and it does have 
uniform growth and it does look pretty good on to   our second tray this is the worm castings this is 
something we've never tried in this space before   and the results are honestly quite comparable 
if you look right here you can see that I mean   there's not much difference the cotyledons 
are slightly larger on the worm casting one   than it is on just the filtered water so it did 
provide a little bit of a benefit it looks like   and remember too that this tray was a little bit 
behind on growth compared to the water one so it   looks like it actually caught up and perhaps even 
maybe beat it a little bit onto our third tray   which again was behind everything else this is 
our ocean solution tray and like I predicted this   just absolutely crushed it now the cada liens 
are quite huge they're a little bit lighter in   color that is something I noticed so maybe there 
is a slight nutrient deficiency there happening   maybe a little bit more of magnesium or something 
like that could help to darken these up a little   bit but for actual growth in size they are quite 
huge I mean let's just pull this one out of the   way real quick and set this the way and set our 
water tray directly next to our nutrient added   with the ocean solution okay so when people say 
that nutrients don't provide any benefit this is   why I disagree I mean as you can see here clearly 
this tray whenever we showed it I think that was   about eight days or so ago now was actually quite 
a bit behind this tray which was just our filtered   water this one had poor germination and once we 
began to add the nutrients these things just came   to life and they begin to grow very aggressively 
and grow quite large and they're actually getting   to the true leaf stage first ahead of everything 
else so this is why I disagree with people when   they say that nutrients do not provide any kind of 
benefit to microgreens that microgreens have all   the nutrients they need I agree yes they they are 
able to grow like this Trey was able to grow well   I'm not disagreeing with that it does look nice it 
is a nice tray of microgreens but if I'm trying to   get to a larger crop quicker I'm going to add 
nutrients because it does provide benefit from   all the tests that we've run I mean it obviously 
depends on what kind of nutrient you're using as   you can see in this test there was kind of mixed 
results with our worm castings maybe we didn't   do it correctly maybe we didn't allow enough time 
for beneficial bacteria to become developed and B   create an organic little nutrient system there's 
a lot of things that could have happened with the   worm castings but as for a nutrient that we've 
tested quite a few times on quite a few different   varieties this is showing to just absolutely crush 
just regular filtered water so let me go ahead and   set this over get our tray back here and then if 
you guys will remember our last tray was the one   that was furthest behind and honestly I didn't 
think it was gonna do too well because it was   pretty terrible but it has caught up quite a bit 
and I'm actually curious to see if it is going to   be able to beat the harvest weight on our just 
only water tray remember this tray right here   on the end had both worm castings and the ocean 
solution and I think it's the ocean solution that   really helped this thing I get these cuddling's 
that are quite large and something I did notice   too with the worm castings if you come close 
is that the everything is a little bit darker   of a green compared to just the ocean solution so 
maybe there's something there too combining these   two for a little bit more coloration a little 
bit more nutrients so that definitely has me   questioning can we add something else to ocean 
solution to really make it more deeper deeper   in colors richer in colors and provide prettier 
hues because that is something we noticed with   ocean solution while it does provide this like 
amazingly aggressive growth sometimes we begin   to see fade of the colors we're not seeing the 
beautiful coloration that we love so a lot of   information but I think that this is a very good 
start to show that adding nutrients does provide   a benefit so I'm gonna go ahead and get all these 
harvested will compare weights we'll talk about   what worked and what did not work so I'll see you 
here in just a moment so it's spinach harvesting   all four of these trays and I'm getting the 
giggles because we just did a very bad take   but it's so for our harvest weights we're gonna 
start in the order that we did this so for our   I'm pretending our imaginary trays are here for 
our h2o group just the plain filtered water we   had a total harvest weight of 258 grams again this 
was only filtered water throughout the entire grow   process from start to finish for our next group 
which would have been our worm castings it was   our second tray that was a total harvest weight 
of 253 grams so now remember that one was a little   bit behind in growth originally so seeing it only 
5 grams behind is pretty great I did have great   coloration on it as well for our third tray the 
ocean solution what do you think the way it was   do you think I doubled it tripled it for Drupal 
dit 10 times the amount of water well it was   nearly double the water group so it's 433 total 
grams for the harvest weight on the ocean solution   and then for our last one which again was just 
terrible I can't believe it actually made it as   far as it did because it germinated so poorly it 
was at 262 grams so our last tray with the ocean   solution and the worm casting nutrients actually 
ended up beating our very first trade the one that   had the most the biggest head start on growth this 
was our water group they ended up beating it by   about only 4 grams but still considering the fact 
that it was about 5 days behind on growth is quite   impressive and it did have some great coloration 
on it so let's talk about what the actual product   looked like and tastes like so the first these 
are again in the same order of all the trays   this is our water group so I mean it was honestly 
pretty good the cotyledons are a little small the   coloration we got a little bit of the purple in 
the stems that you get from broccoli and overall   it was just pretty average for our next one we 
actually had a great beautiful purple coloration   that we noticed especially underneath the leaves 
like you can see on this one here this just like   super deep purple that happens underneath the 
leaves that was from the worm compost group for   our third one this is the ocean solution it did 
not have as much beautiful coloration in the stems   and you can see a little bit down here at the 
bottom and there were a few that did have some   of the purpling underneath the leaves but overall 
it was a lot more muted than all the other colors   but it did have the largest cotyledon size of 
anything in the group and the tallest growth   which made it super easy to harvest and then for 
our last one as you can see it was all over the   place there was some short ones some tall ones but 
the cool thing is we did get some cool coloration   I believe from that worm castings underneath the 
stems or the leaves rather the cotyledons I mean   just look at that deep purple underneath that 
cotyledon can you guys see that pretty good or   it had some beautiful coloration and that was 
the group that had both the ocean solution and   the worm compost so what worked and what didn't 
work so honestly everything worked in this test   the cool thing about water is yes it does provide 
good growth but we find that you can just get   better growth through adding nutrients and there's 
honestly so many different types of nutrients that   you can add that you can really create whatever 
kind of product that you want to create there's   so many different ways to get different types of 
coloration and tastes all within these different   greens just because it's broccoli doesn't mean 
it's always gonna have the same exact appearance   in the same exact taste whenever you grow it with 
different nutrients there's so many things that   can be affected by that and also how you germinate 
them and how you control your climate there's just   a lot of different things you can do to affect 
your crop and adding nutrients is one of those   so does nutrient affect growth I would have to 
say via this test even though it was just oh Sh   in solution that really showed that it crushed 
it I would say yes what we'll be doing now is   I'm going to start some more tests with some other 
nutrients that I know are a lot stronger I'm going   to do oh Sh in solution again because it just 
does amazing we're also gonna bring back some   maxi Gro that's something that we use in the past 
it's a much stronger formula and it's actually a   synthetic so it's not an organic one but it still 
provides great growth and great taste and then for   the last one it's something I can bring back 
farmers pride I haven't done farmers pride in   a long time that was something that we used to 
love using on our adult crops when we used to   grow them out when we lived in East Texas we still 
grow a lot of collards and bangs and that was our   hydroponic nutrients that in maxy grow both just 
do really really well so what I'm gonna do is I'm   gonna begun another test I'm probably start this 
after the holidays over though so probably the   first of the new year because right now we're 
kind of winding down we're gonna go spend a   few days with family and you know this has been 
a lot of work doing everything that we've done   so we're just gonna take a little bit of a break 
for a few days so those tests will begin as soon   as this new year begins as well so I hope that

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JtHJnooXZU,_JtHJnooXZU,Welcome to our guide on how to plant broccoli in this video we'll walk you through everything you need to know to successfully plant and grow broccoli in your garden or containers from choosing the right location to harvesting and storing your broccoli we've got you covered so let's dive in and get started on your broccoli growing Journey broccoli Brasa olaria VAR italica is a nutritious and versatile vegetable that belongs to the brasac casier family which also includes cabbage cauliflower and kale it is a cool season crop that is cultivated for its edible flower heads which are harvested before the flowers fully Bloom broccoli plants are bial but they are typically grown as annuals they have a compact growth habit with a central stem and large dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem the edible part of the plant is the large dense flower head which is composed of multiple small tightly packed fluids broccoli plants produce a single large flower head at the top of the central stem the flower head consists of numerous florids that develop in a spiral pattern broccoli is harvested when the flower buds are still tight and compact typically before the flowers begin to open harvesting at the right time ensures the best flavor and texture there are several varieties of broccoli available including traditional green broccoli as well as purple and white varieties some varieties produce side shoots after the main head is harvested allowing for additional Harvest s the best variety of broccoli to grow in your garden depends on several factors including your location climate growing season and personal preference here are some popular broccoli varieties that are well suited for home gardeners calibra broccoli is the most common and widely grown variety of broccoli it produces large dark green heads with tight compact flits calab broccoli is known for its excellent flavor and texture and is suitable for both spring and fall planting Theo broccoli is an heirloom variety known for its prolific side shoots which continue to produce after the main head is harvested Dio broccoli is a good choice for gardeners who want a continuous Harvest throughout the season it has smaller heads compared to calabra broccoli but is highly productive walam 29 broccoli is well suited for fall planting and is known for its cold tolerance Waltham 29 broccoli produces large uniform heads with a fine texture and Mild flavor it is a reliable choice for gardeners in cooler climates or those looking for a late season crop Romanesco broccoli is a unique variety featuring striking lime green heads with a fractal-like appearance Romanesco broccoli has a slightly nutty flavor and crunchy texture making it a popular choice for gourmet dishes it is best suited for spring planting and thrives in cool mild climates purple sprouting broccoli as the name suggests this variety produces vibrant purple heads heads and tender stems purple sprouting broccoli is a cold hearty variety that is typically planted in the fall for Harvest and late winter or early spring it has a mild sweet flavor and is prized for its ornamental appeal when choosing a broccoli variety for your garden consider factors such as your local climate growing season and available space it's also a good idea to read reviews and recommendations from other gardeners in your area to find varieties that perform well in your specific growing conditions ultimately the best variety of broccoli is one that suits your taste preferences and gardening goals broccoli is prized for its nutritional value as it is rich in vitamins minerals and antioxidants it is particularly high in vitamin C vitamin K folate and fiber making it a nutritious addition to any diet regular consumption of broccoli has been associated with numerous health benefits including reduced risk of chronic diseases and improved overall health broccoli thrives best in regions with cool temperate climates it prefers temperatures between 45° F and 75° fhe or 7 to 24° C for optimal growth in terms of geography broccoli grows well in areas with mild Winters and moderate Summers coastal regions with foggy mornings and cool evenings are often ideal for growing broccoli additionally areas with well- drained soil and consistent moisture levels are beneficial for broccoli cultivation regions with a Mediterranean climate such as parts of California and the Pacific Northwest in the United States as well as certain parts of Europe and Australia are known for producing highquality broccoli crops choose a spot that receives full sun for at least 6 to 8 hours a day broccoli thrives in sunlight and requires ample light for proper growth and development opt for an area with well- draining fertile soil with a pH level between 6.0 and 7.0 broccoli prefers soil that is rich in organic matter and nutrients avoid planting in compacted or water logged soil as it can lead to poor growth and disease issues good air circulation is crucial for preventing fungal diseases such as powdery mildew and Downey mildew choose a location that allows for adequate air flow around your broccoli plants avoiding crowded or overly shaded areas proper spacing between plants can also help promote air circulation and reduce the risk of disease while broccoli enjoys gentle breezes strong winds can damage delicate stems and leaves if your garden is prone to windy conditions consider planting your broccoli near a Windbreak such as a fence or hedge to provide protection from strong gusts alternatively you can use Stakes or row covers to Shield your plants from excessive wind exposure when planting your garden layout consider planting broccoli alongside other cool seasoned crops such as cabbage cauliflower and kale companion planting can help deter pests maximize space and improve overall Garden Health avoid planting broccoli near heat loving crops such as tomatoes and peppers as they may compete for nutrients and space now that you've selected the perfect location for your broccoli it's time to plant your seedlings or seeds broccoli is a cool seasoned crop that thrives in temperatures between 45 and 75° F or 7 to 24° C for best results plant broccoli in early spring or late summer to avoid extreme heat or cold check your local Frost dates to determine the optimal planting times for your area you have the option to start broccoli from either seedlings or seeds seedlings are young plants grown from seeds and containers and are readily available at nurseries and garden centers alternatively you can start broccoli from seeds indoors 6 to 8 weeks before your intended planting date and Transplant them into the garden once they have developed several true leaves prepare the soil by loosening it to a depth of 6 to 8 in 15 to 20 cm using using a garden fork or tiller remove any weeds rocks or debris from the planting area incorporate organic matter such as compost or age manure to improve soil fertility and structure if transplanting seedlings dig a hole slightly larger than the root ball and plant each seedling at the same depth it was growing in its container space broccoli plants 18 to 24 in 46 to 61 CM apart in rows space 24 to 36 in 61 to 91 CM apart if planting from seeds sew them 1/4 to 1/2 in 6 to 13 mm deep and thin seedlings to the appropriate spacing once they have germinated after planting water your broccoli thoroughly to settle the soil and provide moisture to the roots maintain consistent soil moisture throughout the growing season ensuring that the soil remains evenly moist but not water loged water deeply whenever the top inch of soil feels dry especially during dry periods or hot weather apply a layer of organic mulch such as straw shredded leaves or grass clippings around your broccoli plants to help conserve soil moisture suppress weeds and regulate soil temperature mulching also helps prevent soil splashing onto the foliage reducing the risk of soil born diseases broccoli plants require consistent moisture to develop healthy heads water deeply whenever the top inch of soil feels dry providing approximately 1 to 1.5 in 2.5 to 3.8 cm of water per week either through rainfall or supplemental irrigation avoid overhead watering as wet foliage can increase the risk of fungal diseases fertilize your broccoli plants periodically to provide essential nutrients for robust growth and development use a balanced fertilizer or a fertilizer formulated specifically for vegetables applying it according to the manufacturer's instructions alternatively side dress your broccoli plants with compost or aged manure halfway through the growing season to replenish soil nutrients keep the area around your broccoli plants free from Weeds as they compete with your broccoli for water nutrients and sunlight regularly remove weeds by hand or use mulch to suppress weed growth and conserve soil moisture be careful when weeding to avoid damaging the shallow roots of your broccoli plants monitor your broccoli plants regularly for signs of insect pests such as aphids cat Gage worms and flea beetles handpick pests when feasible or use insecticidal soaps neem oil or other organic pest control methods to manage infestations floating row covers can also help protect young broccoli plants from insect damage practice good Garden sanitation to minimize the risk of fungal diseases such as powdery mildew and dowy mildew avoid overhead watering overcrowding plants and working in the garden when foliage is wet remove and dispose of any diseased plant material promptly to prevent the spread of pathogens as your broccoli plants mature and develop heads Provide support to prevent them from toppling over under their own weight use staks or cages to support tall broccoli varieties tying them Loosely to the stakes with Garden twine if necessary this will help keep the heads off the ground and reduce the risk of damage or rot by selecting the right variety preparing the soil properly providing adequate sunlight and water and implementing proper care and maintenance practices you can cultivate healthy broccoli plants and enjoy a Bountiful Harvest of nutritious and delicious flates whether you're a seasoned Gardener or a beginner growing broccoli can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience that allows you to savor the taste of fresh homegrown produce so roll up your sleeves get your hands dirty and enjoy the journey of growing your own broccoli right in your backyard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqgGMdO3Rp4,NqgGMdO3Rp4,"(gentle guitar music) - Now is that amazing time of harvesting purple sprouting broccoli which has been standing here all winter, last autumn, even most of last summer. So these plants, this is
pigeon protection, by the way, because birds love to eat
these brassica leaves, particularly in the winter. Bit less so now but actually,
they're still there. So these plants, we sowed
the middle of June last year. Now it's towards the end of April so they're 10 months old and they're a variety that has been bred to produce at this time. So if you grew normal,
like calabrese broccoli and tried to do this, it wouldn't work because it's not bred to over winter and then produce in the spring. Certainly not to this level. These plants are frost
hardy to a certain extent. They will go down to about
minus 10, 14 Fahrenheit. We've had this winter,
we had one night minus 7. They look pretty sad, their leaves all go drooping in the frost. They've had snow on them as well. That's fine, actually better in a way, to have some snow, keep
the worst of the frost off. So they're cold resistant, frost resistant but if your continental climate below say minus 10, 14 Fahrenheit, maybe they won't survive the winter. I always still try 2 or 3 just to see because the final result
that we're seeing now, well it's an ongoing result because there's several harvests, is just these beautiful heads. Choosing the variety is really important. So you want to be clear, read the small print about harvest date. I've had quite a few inquiries
from readers who say, oh I don't know what
happened to my broccoli. I sowed it last summer and
it never produced anything before winter so I pulled it up. And one of them even then said, ""And then I checked on the seed packet."" Ah, they were kicking
themselves basically. So, this will sit here in the autumn doing nothing in terms of broccoli. It's just a nice leafy plant. The bigger it gets the better, because then it's got more root energy and power in the plant to
produce you a big harvest. Then how to get that? Well, this is no dig, works
really well for brassicas. Undisturbed soil. This followed broad beans, so we were cropping broad beans last June. As soon as they finished,
we took them out. No more compost, no fertilizer, transplanted the broccoli July the 2nd. Then a key bit, A thing you need to do is to protect it from insects in the summer. This is a brassica, so,
caterpillars will eat it, flea beetles, all those
insects that love those leaves. So, first six weeks, it was under mesh. Not quite like this one,
more a slightly finer mesh. This one's Thermacrop, which
is a little bit more for warmth over early lettuce in this case. So, investing in mash is worthwhile, because you can use it and
reuse it several times. It's just fine fabric that
keeps out the insects, and here in our climate, temperate, I find it sufficient to keep that on during the summer months. And then we take it off
towards the end of August. You could leave it on for longer if you've got a big enough piece but the plants are getting quite big. And then, I actually
follow up through September with 2 or 3 sprays or
bacillus thuringiensis which is an organic bacteria. It sits on the leaf and
if the caterpillars, only caterpillars are affected by it, because they eat the
leaf, they get ingestion. So that reduces the damage to the leaves, so, all with the aim of getting
a nice big plant by winter. One other factor is
the wind on the plants. And this one, for example at its base, it's going
like that and then up, it's leaning, and I found over time over
many years of doing this, it's easier to let them fall
down and then grow up again. That, often in the
summer they'll shoot up, make quite a big plant and then you'll get an occasional wind and
they got a bit fragile, they blow over. And at first it looks awful but then in time they
can carry on growing. They're not terminal or anything. And it means they're
reclining on the ground. It reduces the overall height,
which is quite good as well because you know, the higher they are the more vulnerable they
are too, a lot more exposed. And so for me, what I'm seeing
here is just absolutely fine. This plant is slightly bigger than that, And I think the soil is
slightly better there. We put compost on in the winter, so that's partly to
benefit them in the spring, but it's more-so, it's the
ongoing feeding the soil rather than feeding the plant. De-leafing is another job worth doing. You see, that's why we
got mainly bare stems below the fruiting zone. And that's from removing older leaves. There aren't actually many,
that I can show you now. In fact, that one's pretty much fine, but I've been taking off the lower leaves, the ones that grow out
of the base as they grow, we put them on the compost heap. You could eat them. You know, it is a green, but mostly what we're
removing is damaged leaves a little bit yellow, insect eaten often. And the healthiest growth
is always at the top and that's where the
photosynthesis is happening so this is where you want all the action which, this is where you want your leaves. And I think I've covered
most of what's growing so we can now do the lovely harvest. And there are two examples here, one with a full head
and one way I've already picked the head and we got side shoots. The one thing I haven't mentioned actually is choice of variety. Within, first of all this is
purple sprouting broccoli, not calabrese. There are many types of broccoli. Then, this is a hybrid. Now I don't necessarily
like using F1 hybrids but what I've noticed over the years and I've had some feedback
from many of the gardeners is that the old-fashioned varieties have not been maintained by selection. When farmers are producing seed from them, what they should be doing is roguing out the dud plants and selecting only the good ones, the productive ones to keep seed from it. I think with purple sprouting broccoli that hasn't always happened. So the variety I always used
to grow was either early or late purple sprouting, open-pollinated, and that the results got worse and worse. It was smaller, smaller spears. You need several plants by the
way, to keep your own seeds. It's a big job. It's not easy to home save
seed for something like this. So the hybrids have been tightly bred and the result is this, you know, really what more could you ask? Then where you cut it, how you cut it. I do something like that,
but there's options here. All of that is edible. The leaves are absolutely delicious and you've got lots of ... I mean, look at that lovely stem. The sweetness is in the stem. This is where homegrown
you can do so much better than supermarket store-bought broccoli because they tend to favour
and emphasize the head, which looks so stunning, and they grade out the stem. That'll be going on the
farmers compost heap or back in the field. And that's where the sugar is, the sap, now at this time of year. And then, you know,
you could carry on here pick another side shoot
or two to like that. That's what I would call a side shoot, kind of not a side shoot in a way, but... these side shoots, I'll
show you on this plant. So this one, I cut the head last week. That was a nice head. And then we've got regrowth of
what was smaller side shoots. And if you look at them, you can see you new side shoots
coming out with side shoots. So this is how they repeat
crop over a period of up to three, maybe four more weeks, depending on the temperature. So these parts are going
to carry on cropping through the hungry gap. You need to catch them to harvest before these buds get too open, then they start to lose colour. And... This becomes a little bit
more stemmy and fibrous. So there is a perfect moment for broccoli. We're pretty much catching it here. We've had frost this morning. So... yeah, that's just showing
how frost hardy it is. Actually, thanks to the
frost we had this morning, the stems in particular are sweeter because the plants make
sugar as a frost protection. So this is such a win-win
crop at this time of year it's cropping at a time of year when the brassica pests are not around. So there's no caterpillars,
there's no worms, no... even flea beetles actually,
there's hardly any. Go for it! Remember to sow in June though. (gentle guitar music)"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQx2bneF3yw,zQx2bneF3yw,"how's it going everyone today I'm 
gonna share an experiment where we   try to see how many microgreens we can 
fit into a single tray and still get a   healthy harvest so stay tuned for the experiment [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right y'all it has been forever since we have 
done any kind of seed density trial in our gross   space so that's exactly what I'm going to be 
doing today with the crop of broccoli so I've   gone ahead and seeded a whole bunch of trays here 
and you might be noticing that these are actually   different trays than we normally use so as you can 
see in our gross space we normally fill up all of   our shelves with these 1020 trays right here which 
work incredibly well from bootstrap farmer but I   saw these trays on Amazon and I ordered some out 
of curiosity and they turned out to be pretty dang   sturdy and solid lookin trays so what I'm gonna 
be doing is kind of playing around with these   over the next few weeks to see if we can make some 
successful grows happen in these and if they have   any kind of commercial potential so to do that 
what I need to do is figure out if I can fit   these same amount of seeds inside this tray that 
I know really fit inside my 10 20 tray now this   is gonna be cramming these trays up because these 
are actually just about just under half the size   of one of these trays so to give you guys an idea 
these are 200 square inches these team 1020 trays   because they are 10 inches by 20 inches which 
makes 200 square inches and these are actually   eight point five by eleven point five so we're 
at ninety seven point seven five square inches   so just about under half of the normal size of our 
1020's so what I have done is I've seeded each one   of these trays with densities starting at our 
normal density over here and working our way up   to an insane density on this very last tray to see 
if we can get some successful grows out of these   so to give you guys an idea what we normally seed 
in a 1020 tray like this for broccoli is 20 grams   per tray now if you do that 200 square inches that 
breaks down to 0.1 grams per square inch so what   I've done for this first tray is I see they did it 
exactly at that same density so this first tray is   seated at 10 grams for this tray which is at 97 
points seventy-five square inches so it's just a   hair over 0.1 grams per square inch but for the 
sake of math let's just say that it's 100 square   inches because we're just basically right there 
train number two is seated at 15 grams so this is   actually 0.15 grams per square inch and this is a 
hundred and fifty percent higher in density than   the tray number one tray number three has 20 grams 
in it which makes it point two grams per square   inch and that is actually 200 percent higher than 
tray number one and tray number four is seated at   an insane 25 grams which breaks down to 0.25 grams 
per square inch which is 250 percent higher and   it's seeding density than tray number one over 
here I mean you guys could just see the total   difference between these two trays here there's 
basically no breathing room between these seeds   over here on tray number four which is likely 
gonna cause some problems so the reason you do   not want to just dump a whole bunch of seeds into 
a tray and hope for the best is because you are   likely going to run into issues the reason we've 
settled with 0.1 grams per square inch is because   we found that we get the most successful grows we 
get really nice harvest weights we don't have any   issues with dampen off or mold or any kind of 
stress happening to the plants from incredible   densities and that's why we've stuck to these low 
densities so one thing they'll be really exciting   to see in this test is if we can get this tray 
number three right here to grow successfully   and the reason I'm focused on train over three is 
because this is the same density that we plant in   normal 1020 tray so if you guys look just to give 
you an idea it's just under half the size of this   tray so if we were able to successfully grow this 
tray then I have increased my efficiency within   this space tremendously so that's why I'm really 
excited about tray number three and if we somehow   get tray number four to grow without any issues I 
will honestly just be kind of blown away because   there is literally no breathing room between all 
these plants and this is really gonna choke our   air flute flow through all of these plants which 
is it really increases our chances of something   bad happening to this crop and I was losing it 
all together so that was a pretty quick overview   of what's going on all these trays now let me tell 
you what to actually happen to these trays so far   and what we're gonna be doing going forward so 
all these trays have been stacked now for two   days so this is actually day three of the grow 
and that's where you can see all the germination   right now so as you can see a lot of these seeds 
have not fully germinated yet so these are not   done with their germination period I just wanted 
to share the test at this point because this is   about the time that we should start seeing issues 
if there are going to be any because of the crazy   densities so what I'm gonna be doing going 
forward is these actually still need to go   back into germination like I mentioned so we're 
just gonna get all these kind of stacked back up   and placed back into germination I'm just kind 
of showing you guys how I did this real quick   no it's something fun about these trays too that I 
haven't talked about yet as you can see so they're   they're mesh tray is kind of like the bootstrap 
farmer trays and a lot of the roots do kind of   grow down a little bit the room and I just thought 
it was pretty cool really like the tray design on   these so I just want to share that so what we're 
gonna do is I'm gonna get this put back on top I'm   gonna add about 5 pounds of weight to this using a 
sandbag and I'm gonna continue to water this twice   daily just to make sure they stay nice and moist 
throughout their germination process and then in   about two days these should actually be ready 
to go into the light once they've gone through   their blackout and I'm really excited to see if 
we can get all the way to harvest day so that's   it for now I'll keep you guys updated throughout 
this entire process all right today is day four of   this seed density trial so let's go ahead and get 
this weight removed from the top and take a peek   into all of our trays so at first glance I'm like 
holy cow but this number four tray because that is   an insane density that I haven't seen in a while 
so here's number four and check out those roots   so we definitely need to unstack today because I 
felt it actually snag into the tray below it which   is pretty cool and I am very happy with that root 
structure very white very healthy-looking roots so   it's time to get these it's kind of like propping 
itself up it's time to get these into black out   see watch this is you can see how rooted this is 
into the tray below it that's crazy that's crazy   I tell ya then it kind of holds itself up alright 
number two try not to mess up that medium so you   can see I've collected a lot of the seed holes 
from the tray below it on all these stacked ones   so that's not ideal because that's gonna begin 
to decay and the roots but hopefully we should   be able to get through the whole girl without any 
issues and then here's the last tray which has a   pretty healthy root structure - it's a lot smaller 
compared to the others but it's seated a lot less   densely setting these all side-by-side everything 
looks awesome I see about 90% of the seed holes   gone right now I'm gonna pull this guy out cuz 
this is just uh the radicals are pointing upwards   and this isn't gonna grow right so I'm just gonna 
go ahead and pull these out so we don't get those   just dying in the canopy so taking a look like 
I said we've removed most of the seed holes and   all this growth looks really great so what we 
need to be doing today is we're gonna move all   of these into black out since all these are ready 
to start actually standing up and going into the   light and let's kind of see if we see any signs 
of disease on this crazy dense one over here I can   taking a peek I don't see any signs of a mold or 
anything down at the roots so I'm very happy with   this growth that so it is really moist right here 
in the canopy as you can see how my fingers like   glistening so that's something to be we just keep 
our eye on make sure it doesn't say too moist in   this canopy and that's something that's probably 
going to be happening without this throughout this   tray throughout the entire duration of this grow 
is moisture getting trapped in here because of   the lack of airflow between all these sprout links 
here but hopefully we should be able to get solid   grow out of this you're gonna look at the other 
same thing I'm not seeing any signs of like mold   down at the roots I do see a few little broccolis 
flipped upside down there but that's alright same   thing right here I'm just gonna pull out anything 
that's kind of flipped up so it doesn't just die   in our canopy same thing on these lower densities 
taking a look at all these trays one by one the   seed density looks great on tray number one again 
very healthy happy tray number two looks great as   well healthy and happy nothing at the roots that 
looks like mold or disease chair number three   same thing I'm not seeing these sections dying off 
or any signs of anything to worry about and tray   number four it looks just insane in my opinion 
it looks like a carpet is what it looks like   good news is I don't see any like areas where it's 
dying off or any signs of disease or anything like   that so what we need to do today is actually put 
these into blackout so the one thing I like about   these trays is the set of two works really well 
for stacking and blackout you can use basically   two trays for every part of this process that you 
need to to commercially get these to the point of   harvest so I'm going to take this top lid and one 
thing I do like about these trays is well is this   flat lip here on the edge with the other flat 
lip it does really well to keep these balanced   on top pretty dang easily and something that's to 
that I really like about these trays is they're a   little bit wider than the actual tray below so 
that you can kind of position it pretty well on   there compared to say bootstrap trays one thing 
I dislike about them whenever you need to take a   tray I'll just kind of stuck on top of here to 
show you and put it into black out the lips on   both of these are the same exact size so you'll 
notice when you put it on it usually it's pretty   hard to kind of get it lined up and in position 
and usually you'll let light in through at some   point especially with some of the other trays 
they're actually so long too that they actually   work just a little bit so I like these little 
trays because there's no warping and they do   stack up pretty easily okay so all these are now 
into black outs this will stay like this for one   day and I'll see you guys tomorrow when we when 
we remove these from black out and put these into   the light alright y'all these have been in black 
out now for one full day and I'm really excited to   see the results here so let's go ahead and start 
popping off these top trays and take a peek okay   so immediately I can see that we are at the right 
height and I actually see this little broccoli   right here I got distracted that's my ATD kicking 
and I don't like when stuff sits on the surface   like that so I'm gonna go ahead and pull that out 
and move that out of my way so tray number one the   crop looks great we have nice spacing between 
all the crops we are at a very nice height for   broccoli and all the growth looks super solid 
I'm not seeing any signs of disease or mold or   anything like that so it looks great let's move 
on to tray numero dos everything is looking really   good same thing decent spacing on this one and I'm 
seeing no signs of any kind of mold or disease the   crop looks nice and healthy and it's stretched 
up to the height that I like tray number three   all the growth looks super solid on this I'm not 
saying any signs of disease or anything like that   it looks very healthy there is decent spacing 
in there but this is a pretty crowded tray I'm   curious to see how this is going to end up after 
about five more days of growth we will see tray   at numero Quatro so this is the incredibly dense 
tray and the growth on this looks incredible and   surprisingly this has the tallest growth out of 
all of the trays I wonder if it's because there   is so much competition within this tray that the 
the plants are pushing themselves to grow taller   because I know that if you plant two different 
types of seeds directly next to each other they   actually begin to compete for nutrients so I 
wonder if that's kind of what's happening right   here with the height on this tray it looks 
incredibly dense and the growth looks happy   though I'm not seeing anything that's showing me 
signs of disease or mold looking within the canopy   I'm not seeing any mold down there we got a lot 
of root hairs so what you're seeing right there   is root hairs there is no mold so far though now 
it is nice and damp on the actual crop though so   I need to be careful about top watering this good 
news is this is going to be going into light which   means this is going to begin getting bottom water 
so we're no longer going to be putting moisture   into the top of this canopy which is going to 
be nice especially for these super dense ones   over here because if we continue to top water 
this what's going to happen is that's gonna   increase our chances of some kind of disease or 
pathogen or something like that because they're   just gonna be a lot of moisture trapped within 
that canopy on the stems and things like that   which you don't really want which is why we prefer 
to actually bottom water all of our trays because   the moisture comes from the bottom up into the 
roots and you're not pouring it across the top of   the plant let's take a look at all the roots real 
quick just out of curiosity because I know they   were super long yesterday so tray number one looks 
happy healthy I'm not seeing any signs of disease   or mold or anything like that this is a little 
moist and I don't like that that could be the   signs of a potential kind of fungus happening when 
the the root is really moist like that let me get   a paper towel and wipe my finger off real quick 
so I'm seeing a little bit of that right how much   point did not touch it so I'm seeing a little bit 
on that that's part of the recruits right there   on this tray number two as well so good to notice 
and I mean these roots were directly on top of our   shelves yeah I'm seeing a little bit of moisture 
there's like really wet looking kind of soggy root   on some of these and that could be a potential 
issue training before actually surprisingly for   the intensity of the root structure has very very 
low amount of that squishy root syndrome is what   I'm gonna call it I don't know exactly what it is 
but I'm gonna call it squishy root syndrome it's a   it's now a coin term s RS squishy root syndrome 
okay so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna get   all these places into the lights we're gonna get 
some water added to the bottom of these as for   the nutrient that I'm gonna be using I'm gonna be 
using ocean solution 2-0 - three for the nutrients   just because it's an organic nutrient source 
that we really enjoy and it provides really solid   growth to all of our trays I think because these 
are all so dense we do need something that kind   of give them a little bit of a boost of energy 
or did we just keep it water what do you think   Mandy would water or nutrients in our gross space 
which we usually use nutria so okay that's a good   point yeah this is a density test we want to see 
how this would if we were to go forward with this   seed density we would have to do a normal yep so 
okay but we'll do a nutrient okay so we're gonna   use the ocean solution 2-0 - 3 we mix that at 0.5 
ounces per gallon and we pH balance it to about   5.8 range and that's what we're gonna be adding 
into the bottom of all of these trays now one   thing that you're going to notice throughout this 
all these aren't going to receive the same amount   of water the reason is is because this tray number 
one over here is going to require a lot less water   than this tray number four over here it's simply 
the amount of plants within this they're gonna be   sucking up that water and absorbing it and growing 
so I'm not going to be able to use say one cup   per day for all of these it's gonna probably be 
like half a cup for this one and like two cups   for this one towards the end of the grow because 
these are gonna be a little bit more demanding so   I'm gonna go ahead and get these introduced into 
the light get some water at it and I'll see you   guys tomorrow for another update are you guys now 
these broccoli have been in a life for one full   day at this point and all this growth is looking 
super solid as you can see all these Colleen's   have greened up really nicely and all these 
trays are looking really happy something that   Mandy pointed out that I think it's pretty dang 
cool is you can actually see from the densities   it kind of almost tears up the the lowest density 
is the shortest moving all the way to the highest   density being the tallest now that could be that 
they're fighting for kind of that light so they   keep kind of fighting each other to go taller and 
taller to get up towards those lights that could   be potential part of why that is happening and it 
could also be like I said whenever two plants are   planted really close to each other they actually 
compete for nutrients and bangs so they could be   trying to grow more aggressively because they know 
that there's more competition so as for the growth   on all of these I'm taking a look everything looks 
really happy I see that we have removed most of   the seed holes I mean there's a too few tiny 
little seed holes kind of hanging around but as   for everything else the crop looks super healthy I 
am seeing nope I thought it was mold I'll show you   so I saw right here that's actually root hairs I 
thought that was a little bit of mold down bottom   of that plant but looking at it it's all stemming 
right off of the actual stem of the plant and if   it's coming off the plant usually at the base like 
that and it's very fine hair is it's generally the   root hairs and not some kind of mold so the lowest 
density is doing pretty gangsol it looks a little   sparse compared to everything else but I think it 
it will be solid especially considering that this   needs a few more days of growth so it'll have room 
to stretch into itself second tray this is the 20   gram tray or 15 I forget it's 10 at 10 15 20 25 
yeah so this is the 15 gram tray all the growth   on here looks super solid as well the cauda lean 
size is really nice I am noticing a little bit of   moisture so you can see as I kind of brush this 
I spread the growth everything looks solid and   stretching it apart a little bit I'm not seeing 
any kind of disease or anything down there just   some root hairs and the crop generally looks 
really happy onto tray number 3 which is our   28 gram tray so again crop looks really healthy 
as for the height again everything kind T so the   first trade being the lowest and everything just 
seems to kind of increase in height over here so   this is our second tallest tray right now the 
cotyledon size is comparable to everything else   and again I'm seeing a lot of that moisture kind 
of trapped it within this canopy and that makes   sense because we are choked for airflow in here 
now the medium is still very quite wet so I don't   think I'm gonna give this a whole lot of water 
today yeah but I can still see that there's a   decent amount of water still pulling at the bottom 
from last night's watering so I need to be careful   not to overwater this on to trade number four 
again this is just incredibly solid growth there's   a lot of competition happening with this in this 
tray and this is currently our tallest tray it's   received nothing extra other than more seeds so 
it's pretty cool to see these guys all fighting   for height here so no mold or anything like that 
and I'm checking right there because I thought it   was mold but I believe that is root hairs as well 
yep so we've got root hairs no sign of disease our   mold the crop looks extremely happy some of 
the lower cotyledons within this canopy are   yellowing just a little bit and that's because 
they haven't fought their way up to the top of   this canopy to get light that's okay these guys 
should be darkening up over the next few days   as for the watering this tray still feels really 
heavy and I'm noticing there is a little bit of   water dripping whenever I tip this that means that 
this still has ample water so I need to be careful   again not to overwater this tray so I'm just 
gonna give this a very light watering what I'm   going to do now is we've got probably about four 
to five more days of growth on all these trays   instead of doing a day by day what I'll do is now 
probably every two days keep you guys updated with   the growth and what we'll do is everyday I'll just 
do a quick pan on the days that we don't actually   talk about the crops and then we'll talk about it 
maybe every other day or something so I'll see you   guys tomorrow for an update maybe the day after 
all right today is day 7 of this broccoli test for   the density trial and everything is looking really 
happy so I'm just going to do a quick pan across   all of them today so this is the first tray second 
tray third tray and fourth tray which is just   looking crazy so everything's looking really solid 
still a little bit of moisture trapped in the   canopies of the more dense ones but that should 
be going away hopefully soon all right yeah we   are on day nine of this broccoli density trial and 
everything is looking really really solid still so   I'm still noticing a good amount of moisture 
within the canopy of the more densely seated   ones but I'm not noticing you need to Kay on the 
actual cotyledons themselves and overall all the   growth looks super saw and I'm really excited 
because tomorrow is gonna be harvest day so see   you guys then alright you guys we made it to day 
10 of this grow and I'm really excited because all   these crops actually look very healthy and I'm 
really happy with them so what we're gonna do   is do a quick overview of all these trays before 
I get into the finer details after harvesting so   taking a look at our first tray over here remember 
this is our tin gram tray the growth on this looks   super solid we have a nice flat plateau on the 
top the growth looks very even cuddly in size is   nice green coloration on the cotyledons is really 
nice and dark and overall I'm very happy with the   growth looking within a canopy there is not a 
whole lot of undergrowth and what undergrowth   there is does look nice and healthy on to tray 
number two now this is our 15 gram tray and again   same thing nice and a happy growth here I will say 
it's a little bit taller than our first tray and   it does have a little bit more mounding but the 
cotyledon size is great coloration is great I'm   not seeing any signs of decay or rots or anything 
negative looking within a canopy I'm seeing that   we do have some undergrowth but that undergrowth 
does look healthy and it's going to be okay to be   harvested on to Train number three this is our 
twenty gram tray same thing as before so I'm   noticing a lot more smaller cotyledons on this 
tray compared to the first two but overall the   growth does look good there's nothing that shows 
any signs that I can't harvest this from first   glance and looking within the canopy I am noticing 
a decent amount of moisture on the undergrowth and   that can be slightly problematic whenever you go 
to package up this product because that's gonna   make the product decay a lot quicker in the fridge 
so that's just something to be cautious of it is   it still harvestable yes absolutely on to the last 
tray this is our insane density tray of 25 grams   on this tray and the growth looks really great 
we have a lot of mounting going on the height   is the I believe yes it is the tallest out of the 
entire group and a lot of the Colleen's look nice   and large though there are a decent amount of 
small cotyledons mixed in when we spread this   canopy I am seeing a good amount of undergrowth 
and that undergrowth does have some moisture on   it so same thing on the edge of the tray before 
that that moisture on that undergrowth is going   to make this product last not as long whenever it 
is time to actually store it okay so everything   looks great at first glance all the coloration 
looks great growth looks great nothing on all of   these trays and I'm actually really happy because 
I didn't have to treat this at all or any of these   high density trays with any kind of antifungal 
or anything like that so the fact that we were   able to make it all the way to harvest day and not 
have any decay or rot or disease or anything like   that is really promising after our first glance 
everything is looking incredibly solid what we   need to do now is I need to harvest every single 
one of these trays and what I will do after we   harvest is we're going to do a taste test we're 
gonna look at the appearance of the crops see   how it looks we're also gonna take a look at the 
grill medium itself see if there's more disease or   maybe some kind of rot or mold on like the super 
high density or the very low-density something   like that and we're also gonna take a peek at the 
roots because remember when we started this out we   actually had a little bit of what looked like some 
kind of pathogen or something starting in those   roots where they were getting a little bit slimy 
so I'm excited to see how everything actually   looks health-wise once we are able to chop all 
this away and look at that so I'll see you guys   in just a moment once we have actually harvested 
all of these all right you guys before I get into   the harvest weights on all of these I just wanna 
quickly say if you don't mind go ahead and smash   that thumbs up button because it really does help 
out with the YouTube algorithm and helps us create   more content like this if you haven't already 
click that subscribe button and the notification   bell is that way you guys can get notified when 
we release new videos so let's get in to harvest   Waits alright I have finished harvesting all four 
the trays and now let's discuss all their harvest   Waits starting over here on tray one we had a 
total harvest weight of 131 grams on tray - we   had a total harvest weight of 228 grams tray 
number three had a harvest weight of 280 grams and   tray number four had a total harvest weight of 358 
grams now this makes sense that you're gonna see   all these weights get higher and higher because 
the seed density go up did go up and up now what I   wanted to know was how efficient was each tray so 
taking a look at tray 1 remember we had 10 grams   to start with and we had 131 grams of harvest 
which means we harvested 13.1 grams for every 1   gram of seed that we planted tray number two we 
seeded with 15 grams and we harvested 228 grams   that means that we got fifteen point two grams 
per 1 gram of seed tray number three had 20 grams   seated and 280 gram harvest which means we got 14 
grams per 1 gram of seed and tray number four had   25 grams seeded into it and a harvest rate of 358 
grams which means we got 14 point three two grams   of product for the one gram of C that we harvested 
okay so tray number two was the most efficient   tray out of all the groups with 15 point 2 grams 
per 1 gram of seed the second most efficient tray   was the tray number 4 with 14 point 3 2 grams for 
every gram of seed that we seeded the third most   efficient was tray number 3 at 14 grams per 
1 gram of C and the least efficient TRAI was   actually trained number one with the 13.1 grams 
of seed per 1 gram of seed that was seeded so the   reason I think that this could have potentially 
happened is trade number one had a lot more time   and space to grow so didn't really focus on kind 
of fighting each other and doing that a crazy   aggressive growth that we saw on all of these 
which is potentially why we got higher harvest   weights now something else that is a slight factor 
is choice number three and four did have a decent   amount of moisture in their canopies so that 
could have increased their yields substantially   because water is actually very very heavy so what 
I would have to do to see the most accurate way   of actually determining which tray had the best 
harvest weight would to be take all the product   and dehydrate it and then weigh that out but that 
is honestly really complicated so I'll just kind   of give these two a slight handicap because they 
did have a little bit of moisture in the canopy so   they're probably not as efficient as they claim to 
be but tray number two didn't really have any of   that moisture in its canopy so I really do believe 
that trait number two was the most efficient out   of all these groups now let's quickly take a look 
at all of the grow mediums and see what's going on   with each one of them the drone medium looks nice 
I'm not seeing any signs of mold or decay there   is a little bit of that right there is mold coming 
off of a seed that just did not germinate well but   for actual mold because of potential like airflow 
issues I'm not really seeing anything problematic   on it let's take a look at the roots as well so 
the roots do not look as beautiful as I would love   but that's because there's some cocoa mixed into 
it and they don't really look bad at all honestly   I think they look pretty decent they are a little 
bit slimy and there's some looks like a little bit   of broccoli tried to grow upside down down into 
the water so it was kind of molded down there   but no issues there that I'm really seeing okay 
and as for tray number two the medium does look   pretty good I am noticing a little bit of mold 
kind of scattered throughout and I have noticed   a few of those fungus gnats that's because we had 
compost in our grow space and it kind of released   a few of them but overall it's really nice I mean 
I am seeing a few little spots but nothing like   problematic oh my goodness this is gonna ruin 
this cropper this is not harvest-able or edible   so nothing too problematic guys Roots nice and 
healthy structure again it's a little brown from   the cocoa but overall I don't see anything that 
is an issue within this other than the broccoli   like that likes to grow upside down into the water 
reservoirs trade number three taking a look at the   grown medium it's kind of hard to see here because 
this is so incredibly dense with a stem but   looking into it I'm not seeing a whole lot of mold 
or anything like that there are a few seeds over   in this corner that did mold but that doesn't look 
like it was an airflow issue because those are   on the outside and there was plenty of airflow on 
the outside I just looked like some seed that did   mold now right here let me try to take a good look 
at this because it is hairy that it appears this   to be root hairs I'm not I don't think that's an 
actual mold yeah that's all just coming straight   off of the stems itself so that doesn't seem to 
be mold and then that biggest part where all those   stems were so again overall it looks nice and 
healthy nothing problematic and same goes with the   roots it's so funny that so many of those broccoli 
screw upside down oh yeah tray number four taking   a look at this same thing so there was a lot of 
seed holes I will say that because this was so   incredibly dense whenever I was harvesting I had 
to kind of chop a little bit higher you can see   how much stem I actually had to cut off because 
there was just so many seed holes and stuff locked   into it but as for issues with mold or anything 
I'm not really seeing any this is just very very   dense root hairs right here there's nothing 
actually really decaying it's just incredibly   dense root hairs all throughout so again I'm not 
I didn't see any issues at all throughout any of   these tree trays with mold there was slight 
spotting but that's just normal microgreens   you're gonna get little tiny spots of mold it's 
just kind of inevitable if you keep their trays   well watered and the roots on tray number four 
again look really healthy there was one like two   or three little broccolis I grew up side down and 
overall it's extremely happy BAM okay so let me   get all these moved out of my way and we will do 
a blind taste test all right guys so one thing I   want to quickly talk about this is one of the most 
common questions that we get is what do you do   with your medium after you're finished with it and 
it's really really easy so I'm just gonna kind of   demonstrate we have a compost outside and what we 
do is I will take this grow medium and I will just   literally I'll just flip it I'm going to pretend 
like this is our compost right here I just kind of   go like that right down into our compost pile and 
you'll have usually some roots or something kind   of stuck on just make sure you kind of knock all 
of that off and then that's literally all I do I   knock that out into my compost and then I will 
add some dry medium or whatever I need to do   to help that compost kind of break all this down 
and then I will reason reuse this in our garden   in the future so I just wanna let you guys know 
about that because it is one of our most common   questions ok before I get into the taste testing 
let's go ahead and talk about the appearance on   each one of these crops so starting over here this 
was tray number one it did have these shortest   growth of everything but overall the crop is very 
healthy there's not a whole lot of undergrowth   and if there is undergrowth it does look quite 
healthy onto tray number two it's a little bit   taller than the crop was entrant number one and 
there was a decent amount more undergrowth but   again that undergrowth does look nice and healthy 
there's not really any moisture trapped on it   tray number three was again taller than all the 
groups before it but there's quite a bit more of   the undergrowth in this one and the undergrowth is 
beginning to appear unhealthy at this density and   on to Train number four this was the tallest of 
all the groups we got a ton of stems overall the   crop does look really healthy but there was a good 
amount of undergrowth and that undergrowth was the   poorest like it was in the worst condition out of 
all these groups and it was the most concerning   so that's it for just a quick glance at all the 
appearance of these if I had to choose appearance   wise which one I would choose I would go with 
group two because it's a really nice height   there's not too much stems Colleen's are really 
nice the undergrowth is nice and healthy that's   the one I would choose for best overall appearance 
and let's go ahead and do a quick taste test on   all of these well I am blindfolded so that I am 
trying not to be biased here so Mandy if you'll   show them which one we're gonna eat and remember 
it's an order of one two three four all the way   up and you just show which one and I'll munch it 
is that all of them yeah okay little less next   time I mean just cuz I've done so many taste 
tests I can tell that this is substantially   taller than the rest so I feel like this was 
group 3 or 4 overall though I'm very happy with   the flavor there's nothing no bitterness nice 
Brassica flavor nice and strong nice and juicy okay overall flavor for that group it was 
really nice there was something in there   that I didn't love as much it was very 
strong on Brassica flavor but there was   also a slight other flavor don't really 
know what it was I wasn't as mild as the   first group that she shared with me so 
it might have just been more flavor yes again very juicy very nice lots of flavor 
I'll girl they all basically tasted the   same at this point just I've noticed some with 
a little bit more stem and some not next one oh it's so tiny this has got to be Group one okay 
so it's just that was really nice but there it was   very lacking like it wasn't I don't know like it 
disappeared very quickly which I guess is kind of   nice if you're using that on a salad or sandwich 
or something you want to go down quickly that was   nice but just didn't have as much grab or crunch 
or bite to it and I wish it would stuck it would   have stuck around just a little bit longer in 
my mouth as for flavor it was really awesome   and I'd really think everything so far was that 
all of them I think all the flavors on all of   these were really really nice that first one did 
seem to be be more mild of all the groups so if   I had to choose a winner for flavor it'd have 
to be two or three probably because yeah I felt   like it was a nice chewiness on though so two or 
three winner on flavor I can't remember which is   best but it was one of those two so let me get 
those pulled off oops okay so tell me an order   but what do we do first one was number three 
okay okay - okay okay four yep okay make some   more sense how are you guys so now what I need 
to do is I need to choose an overall winner for   this experiment for me personally I'm going 
to go a tray number two that was a tray that   was seated at a hundred and fifty percent higher 
than our normal seating density and I think that   that tray did give us the best Road appearance 
taste and it was the most efficient tray of all   of them it gave us 15 grams of seed for every 
one gram of tray that we seated while trace   three and four did give us really good growth 
I didn't really like the undergrowth that was   happening and the potential of the moisture being 
captured in the canopy and what they could do to   our stored product is really gonna shorten the 
life of the product overall but we were able to   get some like really crazy heavy harvest weights 
out of it and in fact tray number four it gave us   this same harvest weight that we get out of 1020 
tray with half the tray size but it didn't come   without any kind of repercussions like I said we 
did have a lot of undergrowth and some of that   was beginning to decay and there was quite a bit 
of moisture which again is going to shorten the   shelf life of our product what I've actually 
done now is I've started some other trays with   the same seed density of training number four 
for its really hide seed density and what I'm   doing is I'm gonna see how we can possibly see 
the tray differently to allow better air flow   through the tray and see if we can get away 
with that same hi-c density and maybe get rid   of that moisture and undergrowth since this 
test turned out so well and I actually found   a more efficient seating density for broccoli 
I think now we should actually expand out to   radishes and other different types of crops to see 
what we can find works best for seed density and   our grow space if you guys enjoyed this video

the three top crops that you might try growing that could make a good return for both your time and your money and might be able to take care of you and your family financially hey everybody Chad Cruiser here with health and Homestead and you know that on our Channel typically we are talking about how to grow your own food store food and these kinds of things and we're also talking about health and nutrition today I'm at the Eden Valley in Institute of wellness and we're going to talk to the Head farmer here who has done a phenomenal job with the farm here and he is going to tell us what he thinks if he just had two acres what three crops might he start with the top three so he could make a good living to begin with on a new Homestead so let's hear what adner has to say number one in this area at least and many areas actually uh strawberries it's a big seller it sells well it is e easy an easy crop to keep up with and it doesn't have a lot of uh work in terms of um comparison with like tomatoes or other crops the one n the first crop can vary depending on where you are um so just something to have in mind but here and in most here in Colorado and in most areas here in America uh strawberries will be the number one that I would go for one of the things is the strawberries uh you can have a variety for example that that is called um a varietal meaning a a type of strawberries that are called June bearing and what it means is that all the strawberries that they will ever produce that year will come all at ones so that will give you at least a month of busy work and then after that you're done meaning in terms of harvesting after that you just have to make sure that you are watering they're they being watered and as well that that all the runners and and meaning these little plants that go off the strawberries are actually getting cut so that way your plants will be robust uh robust for the next year so for our family for example I grew up in the country and for a family a a strawberry crop like this will be fairly easy because it with 2 three hours every morning you can keep up with all the work that there is if you do it with this mess method that is with a weed mat and you cover all the weeds and you just poke holes where your plants will be so you don't have a lot of weeding to do and you just have to make sure that you it's been watered it's been fer fertilized and as well that you're keeping up with the runners that comes off off the plants how much land do you have planted in strawberries right now so right now we have about quarter of an acre planted with strawberries that is uh 6,000 plants we have here right now and uh we're harvesting about about 150 to 200 pins of strawberries a week so um that's that's a lot but at the same time this is enough for a family uh in a in a homestead in the country to to have a good income how how much money would it cost to do about this much to put it in with the covering and everything with the uh wheat mat and as well the the plants and the fertilizer and the drip system all of it you will spend about uh $3,000 so this is how much it will cost to to do all this so the reason I don't recommend tomatoes for example in a greenhouse for number one crop because first of all you need a greenhouse and those are expensive and second of all tomatoes growing tomatoes in Greenhouse is a very complex crop that it takes a long time and several years for you to actually learn it and dial it it in and even after you learn you know know it and you learn all these tricks and techniques is a highrisk crop meaning uh disease can come or something and and it can kill your crop unlike strawberries strawberries yes some disease can attack attack it or animals but there the the chances of you having fungus fungus or other things it's it's it's less a lot less in in strawberries so it's it's a very easy easygoing crop too to do for for a family if I would have a Farm strawberries that's my number one crop what do you estimate you could potentially make this this year in on this patch of strawberries so the on on this patch we will we would uh we are we are estimated and we're on track to make about 30 to $40,000 and and on uh how how much land was it again h on a quarter of an acre okay our next crop to that I would consider planting after strawberries is actually there's two of them the first one will be garlic uh garlic is something that it's very easy for several reasons one of the first reason is that you plant them in the fall winter winter comes you don't there's no weeding to do everything is frozen and in the spring you just simply make sure the garlic is is weeded and then Midsummer you're harvesting garlic and the second reason as well one of the second reasons that I like garlic is because you have about four to six months depends on the variety of garlic that you plant to sell it uh or to do something with it um and it gives you time to find the right buyers or to find the right farmers market so you don't you don't you're not on a on a pinch you're not on a hurry like for example Tomatoes or strawberries they need to be sold fast but garlic is that's not the case the third crop for growing as a homestead or having just having your own farm for profit will be aspargus aspargus is one of those crops that you can actually grow uh fairly easy you plant them and then it takes three years for the crop to be established but after that it's easy you just have to make sure it's it's weeded between the rows so just with a push mower and 6 weeks in the spring you are harvesting asparagus for 6 weeks after that you let the Spas grow like this ones and you just make sure they're water throughout the summer and then that's that's it there's there's hardly any maintenance for asparagus there are two key elements to consider when looking for crops to grow in your area and one of them is easy to grow and it brings profit garlic and asparagus are some of those they're very easy to grow they they take work but at different times of the year asparagus is in the spring garlics is Midsummer and of course the strawberries it's more like throughout throughout the year so that's one of the things that um this crops provide and that's why I would choose those um those crops as the main crops the reason at Eden Valley we do this these main crops is because these are the crops that bring income now there are some crops like broccoli cauliflower cilant um other other crops like that that are neat and and nice to grow and they taste great but they're not going to provide an income for you uh for example for you to make $10,000 worth of cilantro you have to sell at least 10 to 15,000 bundles of cilantro but for you to make $10,000 worth of strawberries that's that's fairly easy so that's why choosing this crops is the best because that way in the long run you're not frustrated with farming and as well you just you're just enjoying the farming because you can actually afford it and it's giving you a return so make sure you're focusing those key crops and then you can go into the details Into The Feelers that's how we call them and um and then your farm will be your farm experience will be successful obviously like edner stated things like tomatoes can be a phenomenal way to go but you typically need to have a a good greenhouse set up in many localities not everywhere but in many locations especially in the north you really want a good quality Greenhouse but these are three crops that a family with maybe not a lot of knowledge uh maybe not a lot of money could go right into and start their own farm and be able to hopefully quite rapidly be able to make an income now if you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P8Gn9Hsis,Z7P8Gn9Hsis,"“Second Strategy to Cooking Broccoli” When I used to teach medical students at Tufts, I gave a lecture about this amazing 
new therapeutic called iloccorB. I’d talk about all the new science, all the 
things it could do, excellent safety profile, and just as they were all scrambling 
to buy stock in the company and prescribe it to all their patients, I did the big reveal, apologizing for 
my dyslexia: I had got it backwards. All this time I had been talking about broccoli. Sulforaphane is thought to be 
the active ingredient in broccoli, which may protect our brain, protect our 
eyesight, protect us from free radicals, induce our detoxification enzymes, help 
prevent cancer, as well as help treat it. For example, I’ve talked about how sulforaphane 
can target breast cancer stem cells. But then I talked about how the formation of 
this compound is like a chemical flare reaction, requiring the mixing of a precursor compound with 
an enzyme in broccoli, which is destroyed by cooking. This may explain why we get dramatic suppression of cancer cell growth from raw broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, but hardly anything from boiled, 
microwaved, or steamed — except for microwaved broccoli that actually 
retained some cancer fighting abilities. But who wants to eat raw Brussels sprouts? I shared a strategy, though, for to how 
to get the benefits of raw in cooked form. In raw broccoli, when the sulforaphane 
precursor, called glucoraphanin, mixes with the enzyme, called myrosinase, 
because you chopped or chewed it, given enough time — sitting in your upper stomach, for 
example, waiting to get digested — sulforaphane is born. Now the precursor is resistant to heat, and so 
is the final product, but the enzyme is destroyed. And with no enzyme, there’s 
no sulforaphane production. And that’s why I described 
the hack and hold technique. If you chop the broccoli, Brussels sprouts, 
or kale, collards, cauliflower first, and then wait 40 minutes, then 
you can cook them all you want. The sulforaphane is already made, the enzyme has already done its job, so you don’t need it anymore. When most people make broccoli soup, 
for example, they’re doing it wrong. Most people cook the broccoli 
first, then blend it, but now we know it should be 
done the exact opposite way. Blend it first, wait, and then cook it. What if we’re using frozen broccoli, though? Here’s the amount of sulforaphane
found in someone’s body after they eat broccoli soup 
made from fresh broccoli. Hits their bloodstream within minutes. Here’s after frozen. Commercially produced frozen broccoli 
lacks the ability to form sulforaphane because the vegetables 
are blanched, flash-cooked before they’re frozen for the very 
purpose of deactivating enzymes. This prolongs shelf life 
in the frozen foods section, but the enzyme is dead by the time 
you take it out of your freezer, so it doesn’t matter how much you chop it or how long 
you wait. No sulforaphane is going to be made. This may be why fresh kale suppresses cancer 
cell growth up to 10 times more than frozen. The frozen is still packed with the 
precursor — remember that’s heat resistant — and they can make lots of sulforaphane out of the 
frozen broccoli by adding some exogenous enzyme. But where are you going to get 
some myrosinase enzyme from? Now they bought theirs at a chemical company, but we can just walk into any grocery store. This is another cruciferous 
vegetable, mustard greens. All cruciferous vegetables
have this enzyme. Mustard greens grow out 
of little mustard seeds, which you can buy ground up in 
the spice aisle as mustard powder. So if you sprinkled some mustard powder 
on your cooked frozen broccoli, would it start churning out sulforaphane? We didn’t know, until now. Boiling broccoli prevents the 
formation of any significant levels of sulforaphane due to the 
inactivation of the enzyme. However, addition of powdered mustard 
seeds to the heat processed broccoli significantly increased 
the formation of sulforaphane. Here’s the amount of sulforaphane 
in boiled broccoli; this is how much you get if you 
add a teaspoon of mustard powder. That’s a lot though. 
How about just a half teaspoon? Worked about just as well, suggesting 
maybe we could use even use less. Domestic cooking leads to enzyme inactivation of 
myrosinase and hence stops sulforaphane formation, but addition of powdered mustard seeds 
to cooked cabbage-family vegetables provides a natural source of the enzyme and then 
it’s like you’re practically just eating it raw. So, if you forget to chop your greens in 
the morning for the day, or are using frozen, just sprinkle some mustard powder on top 
at the dinner table and you’re all set. Or some daikon radish, or horseradish, or wasabi: 
all cruciferous vegetables packed with the enzyme. Here they just used like a quarter teaspoon for 
7 cups of broccoli, so just a tiny pinch can do it. Or you can add a small amount of fresh 
greens to your cooked greens, right, because the fresh greens have that enzyme that can 
go to work on the precursor in the cooked greens. One of the first things I used to do in 
the morning is chop my greens for the day, and so when lunch and supper rolls around they’re 
good to go, as per the hack and hold strategy, but now with the mustard powder plan, 
I don’t have to pre-chop."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ieCWDAuYc,42ieCWDAuYc,"Hey everybody it's Jeff. Welcome back to the San 
Diego Seed Company YouTube channel. Today we are   talking about brassicas or cruciferous or cole 
crops how to plant them, everything that you   need to know to go from a little tiny seed to a 
huge head of broccoli or cabbage or cauliflower.   You're going to learn it all today before we get 
into that I learned a quick fun fact that I just   wanted to share real quick I grew up hearing these 
always referred to as cole crops now if you talk   to Brijette she calls them brassicas because it's 
basically the same thing what I learned is that   cole is the old word for cabbage and you still 
hear cole in cole slaw which I thought was pretty   cool now that you know that fact you can put 
that in your back pocket tell it at parties and   just be the life of the party I'm sure what are 
brasas brasas are basically a family of crops that   include uh mustard greens collared greens cabbage 
cauliflower klaa no not kelaw cabbage caulif flow   broccoli brussel sprouts there are a ton of brasas 
out there scientists have taken one plant and   split them up into a variety of different crops 
today I want to focus on three of them and they   are the three biggest the reason I've lumped them 
all together is you pretty much do the same exact   thing for all three crops but there is one crop 
out of the three that is much different than   the other two when we get to harvesting and I'll 
talk about that at the end so the varieties that   I have planted today are Steve's tender early 
green broccoli and walam 29 we've got two types   of cauliflower as well the amazing cauliflower uh 
this is actually the pelleted seed which is super   nice and then the snowball cauliflower this is 
my first year on the amazing I'm excited to see   how the taste difference is between snowball 
and amazing then for the Cabbage we've got the   Copenhagen early market and the allseason Cabbage 
okay so let's get into how to grow these I'm going   to do a quick overview of seed starting we have 
tons and tons of videos on our Channel about how   to seed start but I'll just give you the quick 
and dirty seed starting 101 as you can see I've   got my tray I filled my tray up with seed starting 
mix or potting soil if you do potting soil you're   definitely going to want to sift the soil that you 
put on top of the seeds because potting soil can   have bigger chunks of wood in it anytime you have 
anything big on those sometimes it can inhibit the   germination rate and if you don't want to waste 3 
to 5 days or 5 to 7 days you want all your seeds   to pop up quick rule of thumb about seed planting 
depth it's always double the width of the seed so   if you look at a prasa seed they're really small 
so you only want to put just a barely a dusting   maybe an eth to a/4 of an inch of soil on top of 
the seed you can always check the back of the seed   pack if you're worried that you're putting too 
much or too little okay so once you have your   tray planted I am going to put these under grow 
lights inside but I don't turn the lights on the   first 3 to 5 days I check them each day as soon as 
I see even one pop up then I'll pop the lights on   remember seeds do not need light to germinate but 
once they do germinate they're going to be yellow   until you get light on them then those uh leaves 
are going to turn green so once all your seeds pop   up the rule of thumb is 4 to 6 weeks but that's 
just a rule of thumb I would consider how hot   is it outside how much space do you have are your 
warm season crops out of the way there are so many   factors from when you take a plant from the their 
starting tray and put them out into the garden   that is just something that comes along with the 
experience but here's a couple things to think   about if it is too hot and the Sun is too harsh 
you're not going to want to put cool season crops   out in the garden wait until definitely plant 
them in the morning but also try to wait for a   cool spell because if you put them out especially 
if you've grown them under grow lights and have it   Harden them off you're going to put them out and 
Fry on the other end of the spectrum you're also   not going to want to let them get too big because 
then they get root bound and what root bound means   is the roots grow in the little tray in a circle 
and then they're less likely to venture out and   get all of the nutrients and water that are in the 
garden now you can break up the roots a little bit   to encourage them to venture out but that just 
stunts the growth so it really is a balancing   act of deciding when you're actually going to 
put them out I'm going to let you guys decide   that and season after season you're going to get 
better and better and better at it one thing that   is definitely a must do is hardening off if you're 
growing things underneath grow lights or in window   light you don't want to put them directly from 
inside to outside without a couple hours each   day of bringing them out into the harsh sunlight 
putting them back inside and just acclimating them   to the weather and to the harshness of the sun 
before we head out into the garden I did want   to say this video is a giveaway video so we are 
going to give away three packs of seeds to three   lucky commenters you're going to get a broccoli a 
cauliflower and a cabbage to enter like the video   subscribe to the channel but the most important 
thing is leave a comment and then subscribe to our   email newsletter because that is how we're going 
to announce the winner and and that's how you're   going to get your seeds sent to you here we are in 
the garden and I'm going to show you how to plant   whether it's a broccoli cabbage or cauliflower 
they are all pretty much the same if you have any   questions about spacing always look at the back of 
your seed pack but I know cuz I plant them every   year you're going to want to get them about 2 ft 
apart now one thing that could be confusing is   there's a thin two and then a final spacing with 
a lot of crops that you're just planting directly   into the ground you're going to thin them and then 
the very final spacing might be different from how   you're going to thin them because you want to 
thin crops and look for the most prolific the   best healthiest looking ones and you're going to 
leave those and take the other ones out but for   this since we've started them in cells we know 
exactly how many plants we've got we're going   to put them directly at 2 ft so let's show you 
how to do that so I've got some great looking   uh broccoli starts here this is the walam 29 if 
you aren't yet to the seed starting stage of your   gardening career and you're still buying them from 
the big box stores or nurseries that's completely   fine what you may find when you take them out of 
their cells is that something I mentioned earlier   and that's that they are root bound this is not 
root bound you can see that they're not bound up   they're just good white healthy looking Roots 
which is what we want and now that brings us   to the type of soil that these crops need almost 
every crop needs well- draining soil with organic   matter like compost or manure added that is light 
and fluffy and well- draining and that is exactly   what we have here if you can tell I just turned 
these beds over from the spring crops I've added   granular fertilizer I've added compost and I've 
raked it flat then the last step is to add the   mulch back in so we go to the dump we get a big 
truckload of mulch and we come and we'll cover all   these beds typically I like to do that before we 
plant because it's just easier to spread the mulch   when there's not plants here but for the sake of 
this video I'm going to go ahead and plant these   so you can see how it's done one thing that you're 
definitely not going to want to do is plant into   dry ground when I turned this bed over we added 
tons and tons and tons of the water when I open   it up to add the compost we're looking good in 
terms of moisture here I am going to look for this   emitter which I know these emitters are 1T apart 
so I'm going to plant one here and then skip two   and plant the other one here and I'm just going 
to dig a hole like this this uh as I go a little   further deep this is looking a little dry so the 
last thing that you want to do is put a plant into   dry ground but one thing you want to look out 
for when you are transplanting is you want to   get it's new home at the same soil level as its 
original home meaning you don't want to bury the   stem for brasas like you would with a tomato 
or pepper cuz you don't want this stem to rot   so this is looking really good this part takes a 
little bit of time and that is watering in you can   see depending on the drainage that your soil has 
it's going to pull and try to run off we're just   going to go ever so slowly so what will happen if 
I only water this little tiny area and everything   around here is dry this dry soil is going to sop 
up all that water away from the roots and that's   the last thing we want so I'm going to take my 
time water the whole area get it really really   really nice and moist and give myself and this 
plant the best opportunity to grow so I'm just   going to come down here 2 ft like I said I know my 
emitters are a foot apart so I could use those or   a lot of tools are 2 ft apart so I'm going to come 
up down here 2 ft now a lot of you are thinking oh   my gosh that looks so far apart you're wasting 
so much Garden space well if you've ever grown   coal crops before you know that they get huge so 
that's why you want to really pay attention to   the spacing on the back of the seed pack you're 
going to get very small stunted unhealthy plants   the main one being there's not enough water and 
nutrients to go around also shading uh they're   going to shade each other and they just can't grow 
to their full potential so definitely these three   coal crops with the broccoli cauliflower and 
cabbage make sure you keep those 2 ft [Music] apart [Music] okay so here's what happened 
shot the video it's way too long we're going   to split it up into two sections but my 
family and I are in Lake Arrowhead so   I couldn't go out to the garden and do 
some sort of transition so I'm going to   do it here so stay tuned for part two 
you're going to learn about pest days   to maturity row cover and harvesting so 
make sure to check that out when it drops [Music]"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ESKWFS-H0,o1ESKWFS-H0,hello everyone this is jack well in this video i'm going to cover top 5 micro green mistakes you must avoid to grow big beautiful luscious microgreens now micro greens are full of nutrition you can easily grow microgreens indoors or even in your kitchen counter to grow very nutritious food you can add micro greens to your salad or you can add them to your sandwich even on pasta so they make a really good addition to your food now growing micro greens is relatively very easy you just have to be very careful about these five mistakes to avoid to grow microgreens so let's get started number one the growing medium now if you just use potting soil or you know just your garden soil you're going to have trouble growing microgreens because they contain a lot of pathogens microbes and a lot of stuff that can grow fungus that can harness fungus gnats you know so you can have a lot of pest problems indoors with dustpan as well and you can also because you're going to be eating microgreens raw just by you know cutting them with scissors and they're going to be in contact with soil so in order to grow micro greens you need a sterile kind of a growing medium now in my gardening i always emphasize living soil because you know i'm always adding organic matter to the soil i'm adding compost worm casting all of this stuff to the soil to make the soil living for microbes to grow and then feed all this nutrition to the plants now in the case of microgreens is not necessarily true because microgreens just derive all of their energy from the seed so they don't need any fertilizer they don't need any microorganism they don't need anything all they need is some sort of a moisture and light and that's about it so growing micro greens does not require compost or fertilizers all i do is just use coconut coir now let me show you the coconut coir that i have that i use to grow micro greens so what i have here is just coconut coir they come in bricks just make sure this coconut oil does not contain any salt because you know a lot of coconuts grow around seashore so they are often dipped into salt water so they can absorb salt if they're processed that way but if they're processed in fresh water they should not contain any salt at all so just make sure that is the case that they do not contain any salt and i use these mushroom containers to grow my microgreens because you know you can grow microgreens in 10 by 20 containers however sometimes we don't get to eat all of that so i just use these mushroom containers to grow my micro greens because they're small they're manageable they're modular and you know they're you know they give you like a good amount of one serving for two people so uh they're perfect size for us to grow microgreens i made a separate video on five benefits of using coconut coir and also how to use the bricks to expand coconut coir in plastic totes as well so check that video out if you're interested okay now that i have my containers ready and they're filled with coconut coir it's time to plant but before planting i'm going to press on this coconut coir just to compress it a little bit so i make a really nice bed for the seeds to sit on now i'm growing some radish micro greens and some pea shoot micro greens you can also grow sunflower micro greens crest micro greens broccoli micro greens there's so many different kind of micro greens you can grow basically these seeds are not any different than the actual plants this is actually radish seeds so you can use actual radish seeds extra broccoli seeds to grow your micro greens and microgreens are basically plants that are actually cut to consume at a very smaller age and they contain a lot more nutrition because they drive all their energy from the seed so that's why microgreens are considered very nutritious and that's why they actually cost a little bit more than any other salad because you use quite a bit of seed to grow micro greens so let's plant these seeds okay so let's start with pea shoot micro greens i'm just going to cover the entire surface with a layer of piston micro greens [Applause] just little bit densely packed and then i'm also going to use reddish micro greens now radish micro green seeds are much smaller as compared to pea shoot micro green seeds so make sure they're evenly spaced and they have some space in you know in between them otherwise they'll be too densely packed with each other now the second mistake everyone makes while growing microgreens is either under watering or over wiring microgreen seeds now if you have trouble over watering create some holes in the bottom of your containers and let the excess water drain out always use a cachement tray at the bottom so you don't have water running around your counter now i don't use catchment trays and i don't create holes because i use coconut coir which absorbs all the excess moisture and coconut coir is really great at actually retaining moisture and providing consistent moisture to the seeds so the coconut water does not let fungus grow and it does not let the seeds dry out either now you can also over water coconut oil as well you should not be standing water in your coconut water coconut oil just should be moist enough so that if you actually squeeze coconut coir there should be a little bit of droplets of water coming out that's all the water you need to provide in order to grow microgreens now the way i water my microgreen seed is that i initially water them when i first plant them then i water every other day and i just make sure that the soil or the coconut oil the growing medium is consistently moist all the time now if you have trouble germinating your micro green seeds and all of your seeds are not germinating evenly try soaking your seeds in water for 12 to 24 hours this will actually help the seed absorb all the moisture and helping germination as well the third mistake everyone makes while growing microgreens is not covering the micro cream seeds and not providing enough weight on top of the microgreen seeds you're supposed to cover the micro greens and also add weight on top of the microgreens so i'm using these clay parts to actually provide weight on top of these micro greens covering the seeds and actually providing the weight on top keeps the seeds in dark which actually helps the roots to grow deeper which in turns helps the plants to grow strong and straight the fourth mistake everyone makes while growing microgreens is not providing enough light to grow microgreens which makes the ceilings very laggy or they might not grow at all so if your window gets enough sunlight you can put your microgreens right by the window or on a windowsill and if you're getting about five to six hours of sunlight during the day that should be enough to grow microgreens now if you don't use a grow light now the grow light that i use is mars hydro this is a 300 watt grow light that i use it provides enough light for for all of these ceilings to grow big and strong and they grow really straight because it has enough light to to soak in all that energy this mars hydro light has been working really well for me it is providing consistent light for all the microgreens to grow really healthy as i mentioned earlier microgreens do not need any fertilizer they only need three things to grow they need the seed which actually provides all the nutrients to the plant they need the light which is where they drive energy and create photosynthesis as well and they need water to grow so those are the only three things that they need coconut coir just serves as a growing media to provide consistent moisture to the seedlings the fifth mistake to avoid while green micro greens is not providing enough aeration now your micro green seeds need constant ear flow to actually grow really healthy if there's not enough air flow fungus and mold will start growing in your microgreens now the best way to provide aeration for your microgreens is with a fan or a draft now if you don't have a fan or a draft nearby where you're growing microgreens what you're going to use is this usb fan it actually hooks up into your computer usb or you can use an outlet with the usb port on it and plug it into the wall and this will provide enough air flow for the micro greens to stay healthy and deter fungus and mold i really hope you enjoyed all of this information i hope you can use all this information to avoid these five microgreen green mistakes and i hope you grow lots of micro green and eat healthy and i'll see you in another video you
