https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R0kzCwGNtw,2R0kzCwGNtw,"Onions are cool-season vegetables that are
grown mainly for the flavor they add to other foods.. Onions begin to form bulbs based on the day
length. Onions can be started from either seeds,
sets, or transplants. Onion seed of both white and yellow varieties
can be sown indoors in flats, in the winter, or early
spring, depending on where you live. In most areas you will need to start your
seedlings indoors. Also, seeds can be sown directly into the
garden, covered with about one-fourth inch of soil and
should sprout between 7- 10 days. If planted thickly, plants can be pulled and
utilized as green onions or scallions for salads or fresh eating
in about 8-10 weeks. However, most gardeners want
to grow an onion bulb as large as possible. To do this, the onion plants must be thinned
until they are at least 2-3 inches apart to insure adequate
bulb expansion. The removed plants can be used
for scallions or you can re-transplanting into another area of the garden so that they
will too have adequate space to enlarge into large bulbs. In my opinion onion seeds is the least recommended
way to start onions. The other option you have is -- Onion Sets. Growing onions from onion sets is probably
an easier way to produce a crop of quality onions,
and in most cases you will be able to achieve better success this way when compared to growing
onions from seed. Sets are small, dry onion bulbs that have
been grown the previous year. They
are the easiest for many gardeners to grow. Buy a bag of sets, push them into damp soil
until just the top is showing and the onion quickly starts
growing. They are frequently sold only as yellow,
white or red onions without a variety name. So if you want to know what varieties your
growing, do not use onions sets. Round onions will produce a flattened onion,
and tear shaped or elongated sets will produce round onion. Larger sets are best used as green onions
while smaller sets are left in the ground to form bulbs. And then, there is the last option for growing
onions – Onion Plants. The way I usually grow onions and how I would
recommend growing onions for the first time. For large, firm bulbs, plants are best. They were produced from seed in the same year
they are sold. Plants are available from seed catalogs, garden
centers or your local hardware stores. Plant
onions – onion plants -- transplants, four to six weeks before the last estimated spring
freeze. Generally plants come in a bundle. Plant the onions 1"" deep and no deeper, as
this will inhibit their ability to bulb. When you receive your onions transplants,
they are alive, and should be planted as soon as
possible. If your unable to plant these right away,
remove the onion plants from the box and spread them out in a cool, dry area. The roots and tops may begin to dry out but
do not be alarmed, as the onion is a member of the lily
family and as such will live for approximately three
weeks off the bulb. The first thing that the onion will do after
planting will be to shoot new roots. The next most important thing in planting
onions, is choosing the right onion to plant based on
your location. There are three different types of onions. Short-day onions, day-neutral onions also
know as intermediate day onions, and long-day onions
First, the Short day onions Form bulbs with 10 to 12 hours of daylight
They need mild winter climate, usually Zone seven or warmer
Planted in fall, mature in late spring And can be grown in the North, but the bulbs
don’t get as large And then we have the Intermediate or day-neutral
onions These form bulbs with 12 to 14 hours of daylight
Produce nice bulbs in all regions except South Florida or South Texas, these intermediate
onions are ideal for Zones five through six
Planted in fall in mild winter climates and in early spring in northern regions
Then lastly you have the Long-day onions Which form bulbs with 14 to 16 hours of daylight
These are typically grown in northern regions, zone six and colder
Day length is the most important factor in selecting your onion varieties. Long day onions grow
north of a line approximately from Washington, DC. to San Francisco, short day onions south
of the line and intermediate day length for several
miles on either side of this line. Flavor and
pungency are other factors in selecting varieties. Sweet white onions are generally long-day
varieties while the best strong-flavored yellow onions are intermediate or short day onions. As far as planting goes Select a location
with full sun where your onions won't be shaded by
other plants. The Soil needs to be well-drained, loose,
and rich in nitrogen; and compact soil affect your
bulb development. You want nice loose, rich soil. Till in aged manure, compost or fertilizer
in the fall before planting. Onions are heavy
feeders and need constant nourishment to produce biggest bulbs. At the time of planting, you can mix in some
fertilizer, too, and side dress every few weeks
until the bulbing process begins. Are you planting seeds? Onion seeds are short-lived. If planting seeds indoors, start with
fresh seeds each year. Start seeds indoors about 6 weeks before transplanting. Transplants
should be set out 4 to 6 weeks prior to the date of the last average freeze. Plant onions as soon as the ground can be
worked in the spring, Make sure the temperature doesn’t go below 20 degrees Fahrenheit
For sets or transplants, plant 1 inch deep, with 4 to 5 inches between each plant. Also I plant
them in rows usually about 12 to 18 inches apart. Should you want to harvest some of the
onions during the growing season as green onions, you may plant the plants as close
as 2 inches apart. Pull every other one, prior to them beginning
to bulb, leaving some for larger onions. Reminder! Do not plant them too deep, or they will not
make as large of a bulb If you have left over onion plants from your
bundle, you can plant them in a pot or plant them in the ground together, like I usually
do, and grow them all season long, and harvest them for “green onions”
. Onion Fertilization and Growing Tips
Onions require a high source of nitrogen. For organic growing like we do, use a rich
compost high in nitrogen. The conventional, non-organic way would be
to use a nitrogen-based ammonium sulfate or ammonium nitrate fertilizer
and this should be applied at the rate of one
cup per twenty feet of row. There is no such thing as an organic all-nitrogen
fertilizer. The first
fertilizer application should be about three weeks after planting and then continue with
applications every 2 to 3 weeks. Once the neck starts feeling soft do not apply
any more fertilizer. This should occur approximately 4 weeks prior
to harvest. Always water immediately
after feeding and maintain moisture during the growing season. The closer to harvest the more
water the onion will require. For weed control Unfortunately, there is not
any organic product available to assist in weed
control so the only method will be cultivation. That’s right, get on your hands and knees
and pull up the weeds. While cultivating be careful not to damage
the onion bulbs. As the onion begins to
bulb the soil around the bulb should loosen so the onion is free to expand. Do not move dirt on
top of the onion since this will prevent the onion from forming its natural bulb. So don’t be
alarmed if you start seeing onion protruding from the ground as the bulb expands and enlarges. Flowering also known as Bolting
Most folks want to grow onion bulbs NOT onion flowers! What causes bulb onions to send up
flower stalks? Flowering of onions can be caused by several
things but usually the most common is temperature fluctuation. If the onion is exposed to warm temperatures,
then cold, then warm again, it will bolt. An onion is classed as a biennial which means
it normally takes 2 years to go from seed to seed. Temperature is the controlling or triggering
factor in this process. If an onion plant is exposed to
alternating cold and warm temperatures resulting in the onion plant going dormant, resuming
growth, going dormant and then resuming growth again, back-and-forth, the onion bulbs
prematurely flower or bolt. The onion is deceived into believing it has
completed two growth cycles or two years of growth in its biennial
life cycle so it finalizes the cycle by blooming. Flowering can be controlled by planting the
right variety at the right time. Use only transplants
that are pencil-sized or smaller in diameter when planting in early spring or always plant
seed. Onions sets are more likely to bolt, because
they were produced the previous year. What can you Do About Flowering Onions? If you can see a flower stalk apper should
you remove the flower stalk from the onion plant? Probably not…it’s not going to do any
difference for you. Suit yourself but once the onion plant has
bolted, or sent up a flower stalk, there is nothing you
can do to eliminate this problem. The onion bulbs will be edible but smaller. Use these onions as
soon as possible because the green flower stalk which emerges through the center of
the bulb will make storage almost impossible. Once again, use these onions First! Harvest them, use them
First. As far as Harvesting And Storage goes, Onions are fully mature when their tops have
fallen over. After pulling from the ground allow
the onion to dry, clip the roots,cut back the tops to about one inch. The key to preserving onions
and to prevent bruising is to keep them in a cool, dry and separated. Remember to use the onions
that bolted or flowered first, they will not last very long in storage. As a general rule, the sweeter
the onion, the higher the water content, and therefore the less shelf life. A more pungent onions
will store longer so eat the sweet varieties first and save the more pungent onions for
storage. So, Happy Garddening and Good Luck on Growing
Onions!"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuJFZkYJWnM,tuJFZkYJWnM,hello good people how are you doing welcome back to inspir Generations this is a place where we learn and I'm so excited to be back with another video I promised you people to be consistent with my videos because we really need to learn together and we have so much that we that we have to learn so today our video is um on how to you know to identify the best variety and to be specific we are talking about onions the best variety for your farm so stay tuned to the end of the video let me know what you think about you know about the video uh leave a comment in the comment section like the video share with your friends and also subscribe let's get into the video yes uh as I said today we want to learn how to know the best variety for your farm because one thing that I want you to understand with my little experience uh doing farming uh different Farms can have different varieties and one of the ways to know that uh when you get to the farming especially when you're doing onion don't do just one variety have two or three varieties and then check on production check on the diseases check on how the particular variety is resistant you know to the diseases or how are they growing so at our farm currently uh the one that you see there that is SV uh SV is a very a very good variety so far you know one this particular onion that you see over here when we were doing the transplanting it was very tiny it was very very tiny actually uh The Mamas who was doing the transplanting actually some of them ended up doing you know planting like transplanting two or three seedlings at the same place because of how little it was because the nursery uh when we did the nursery you know the nursery was so crowded and so the the seedlings were so tiny but then the growth rate of this particular variety is quite amazing you can see I mean this onion is healthy is it it is healthy it is growing quite good and you know what you want to see in your onions that you see the whitish coloration that you see that is what you want to see you know with your onions because that is what is going to grow you you know to become an onion probably maybe I can bring this closer here you see this I'm talking about this the whitish coloration that you see you see this over here this is what I'm talking about so that is what is going to grow to become an onion and another thing with this particular variety you see almost all the onions have bulbed you know at the same time so when you go to the Neptune you will see the difference you will see the difference so almost all the onions have have bued I mean you can see almost all of them they have the whitish coloration almost all of them you know we have this variety of I think from some point there from some point there all the way all the way down there and then on this side too that is the same the same variety so and and also I've noticed something on my Neptune we have a problem with rotting not quite a a big problem but you find you know two or three onions that have you know rotting in one particular bed you know and uh it's a problem that I've seen with Neptune yeah and when I'm talking about Neptune we got our Neptune from Kenya and then we got another one from Tanzania so we wanted to do a mix of it to see you know to compare to have an evolution and then we can make a decision uh which variety as well on our farm so when I go to the Neptune I'll show you the problem that I'm talking about and um but so far so far the the the the the this you know the H fee is doing quite good so I'm waiting to see the production because all our bed you know we have a 30 m bed on both side both the Neptune and the and U and the SV so what I'm going to do I'm going to do a comparison you know how many cages I'm going to get to this on this particular bed of of SV and how many particular kgs I'm going to get from that particular bed of of of Neptune and then after that we can make a decision on which variety we can we can take because even Neptune we have so many varieties you know of or brands of of of of of of Neptune we have Neptune from Tanzania Neptune from South Africa Neptune from Israel so Neptune in Kenya so we have so many of them so at the end of the day you're going to have to make a decision which one do you want to follow and also in terms of decision of course SV Neptune both of the all of them are hybrid seats you want to make sure that you have hybrid seats you know because um some of them are quite you know resistant to diseases which is good and you can see our onions you can see the green you know the uniform of that particular green because that is what you want to see because you know they have some you know very funny we weird colors at the top or maybe some of them appear as if they they're burning like this one over here okay but then let me go to the other side of Neptune and I'll share you I'll share with you what you know what how it does look like yeah so this this is our Neptune this is how it looks like and you can see even them they have started bulbing but then one thing that I've realized with the Neptune they don't grow at the same Pace but most ly that problem is caused you know with how the Neptune was like when it was coming from Nursery because if you have some seedlings that are very tiny and then you have others that are so big then you will see such such a difference so even them have started bulbing you can see you can see this over here all right yeah you want to see you know the whsh coloration that I've shown you on the other side you know we still have the same over here but then I want you to uh to show you something um okay so you see this my friend over here my friend over here this onion this it's not doing okay because there's some particular roting Wing uh on inside here it looks like it's something that is sted quite a long time ago because onion what happens with on once you put them on the soil and they they start they start to grow it's so difficult to kill them all right so even when a disease comes it takes a lot of time for them to die so this one it sted quite a long time so it was eating the onion little by little so you see this the yellow the yellow coloration this is not good because what is happening this particular onion is rotting from inside uh well at the moment we haven't quite understood what is the problem it might be watering it might be fertilizer it might be some other things you know inside the soil that's why it is good to do drenching U after you do your transplanting so there are so many factors so we are still trying to figure out what is the real problem but if I take this thing out you see this this is what I'm talking about see maybe I can bring it close you see this this is rotting so I've seen quite you know not not so many a few maybe uh four or five in particular bed and uh you know one particular bed has more than thousands thousands of of of onions so yeah so it's not quite a big problem but it's something that you want to make sure that you you know you you don't see on your farm so on the SV side I haven't seen that problem at all you know so we are even deliberating with my team to see if next time we can do much of SV than Neptune so yeah that's you know those are some of the ways that you can get to identify some of your varieties of the farm so different Farms will have different varieties that's why you find people in kangela people in kaj County people in liia County most of they are doing different varieties you go to liia you find jambai and some other varieties all right you come to kangela Neptune SV and some other varieties so it varies from from one Farm to another so when you're doing when you're doing your farming make sure that make sure that uh you have different varieties to your farm if you're doing maybe large scale uh so that you know so that you can get to know which one does better you see this this is what you want to see in your F bulbing and then you see this guy over here see this guy over here this is what I'm talking about and I think I've seen another one over here yeah see These Guys these guys this this is not this is is what you want you don't want to see on your farm yeah the bulbing is is amazing you see yeah so that's what I'm talking about all right guys I hope today you have learned something let me know what you think in the comment section like the video share with your friends yeah share with your friends and also don't forget to subscribe I will see you in the next video bye-bye
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4m4E428BgU,H4m4E428BgU,"This past year grew a big trial of 15 different 
varieties of onions, all grown from seeds, which   is something that I had want to do for a while.
I decided to replace the usual large crop   of onions in the Simple Garden that we 
have grown in the past using onion sets,   replacing it with multi sown modules of onion 
seeds, with enough plants of each variety to   hopefully be able to make a decent comparison.
Overall I was really impressed with this crop,   as there was a much bigger yield than I had 
expected from onion plants grown from seeds,   even though the seedlings were stressed 
earlier in the year with poor conditions.  And fewer of the onion plants in this large 
batch bolted or started to produce seed,   compared to two of the other gardens where 
we also grew three of these same varieties.  And with the good weather that we got this year,   there was good yield from all the 
different varieties, with enough   variation in yields to start to figure out 
which varieties I might want to grow again. A lot of the varieties that we grew are fairly 
typical types of onions, with a globe or round   shape, and a yellow or straw coloured skin.
The first one, a variety called Ailsa Craig,   was one of the varieties that we also grew 
in the other gardens, where quite a few of   the plants of this variety bolting in two of 
the gardens with more densely spaced plants.  With the slightly lower density of plants in this 
variety trial, only two of the 28 plants bolted,   and one of the bulbs split at the base, but the 
rest produced a good yield of large bulbs which   were slightly elongated, but I think that 
was more because the plants were squished   together in the multi-sown stations.
Looking at one bulb that I cut open,   the top of the bulb wasn’t so tight which 
might indicate an issue with storage,   but apart from that and the possible tendency 
to bolt, this looks like a decent standard   variety that can produce a lot of onions.
Another globe shaped variety called Rijnsburger   5 produced decent sized bulbs, but something 
seems to have happened with a lot of the plants,   with a few of the clusters missing, 
and I am not sure what happened.  The inside of one bulb that I cut open had 
pronounced drying or decay of the layers at   the top of the bulb, which reduces the amount that 
is edible and may affect how long it will store,   but another bulb of the same variety had 
a tighter top which is what I want to see.  So I won’t know how common this is with this 
variety, or with any of the other varieties,   until we cut open a lot more of the bulbs.
The Sturon variety is one of the few varieties   that I have grown before from onion sets, 
and this batch grown from seeds produced nice   quality bulbs, some of which were slightly 
flatter in shape, with no apparent issues,   and looked good on the inside.
But they were smaller than the   others in this first set of varieties, 
producing only a moderate yield.  Each of these 3 similar open pollinated varieties 
seem to have issues, either with bolting, rotting,   missing plants or smaller yield, but based on 
this one trial I’d probably pick the Ailsa Craig   variety to grow again, at least for producing 
large quantities of conventional types of onions.  The open pollinated Rose de Keruel variety looked 
like a fairly conventional onion on the outside,   with a slight rose coloured 
skin, but this rose colouring   continued into the centre of the bulb, 
producing quite an attractive onion.  This variety produced a relatively high yield, 
but unfortunately 3 of the bulbs were rotten at   the base, and another had split open from 
the inside, indicating it might not be so   successful in this climate, especially 
if we get cool and wet summer weather.  But the remaining bulbs ended up being 
larger than most of the other varieties,   weighing over 400g each on average, 
so perhaps it is worth growing again.  There was one other variety called Stuttgart 
Giant, that I would generally include in this set   of straw coloured onion varieties, with a similar 
colouring inside that many of the others had,   but it had a distinctive flattened shape that 
differentiates it from the other varieties.  The yield of this variety was mediocre,   and it had the smallest bulb size out of all 
the varieties, but the shape and colour was   quite attractive and it didn’t seem to 
have any issues with bolting or rotting. One of the two hybrid varieties 
that we grew in this trial,   named Hytech produced quite a consistent 
crop of well shaped, fairly large onions,   and the third highest yield of all the varieties.
None of the plants showed any signs of bolting,   but there was one small plant that rotted in 
the garden, so not sure if this is significant.  The other hybrid variety called Santero, 
was one of three varieties that I grew   in the other gardens, where quite 
a few of the plants had bolted,   but none in this trial started to 
produce the flower stalk prematurely.  One bulb started to rot before it dried, but the 
rest of the bulbs seemed decent quality, but the   bulb size and yield was significantly smaller than 
the other hybrid type, and seemed less consistent.  Based on this one trial, and a relatively small 
sample size, I am not sure it is worth the extra   cost of the Santero hybrid seeds, but I think it 
might be worth growing the Hytech variety again. Two of the varieties produced bulbs that were   definitely quite a bit bigger than the 
others, and both had paler yellow skin.  The Bedfordshire Champion variety produced some of 
the largest bulbs, weighing 540g each on average,   with some of them quite a bit larger, 
though this was partially because some   of the seedlings in a few clusters did 
not survive the start of the season.  And a few of the larger bulbs ended up splitting 
open at the base, more than with many of the other   varieties, and this reduced the useable yield that 
we harvested, but the inside of the onion I cut   open seemed in good shape, though fairly typical.
The Globo variety produced the biggest yield of   this trial, of consistently large bulbs 
that didn’t seem to have any issues,   and inside there was a pronounced red banding 
which really accentuated the different layers.  The plants were still growing strong when they 
were harvested in September, with no signs of   the usual lodging that occurs with many of 
the other varieties when they stop growing.  So this crop might have grown even bigger, and 
if I wanted the largest yield of big onions, this   Globo variety is definitely one to grow, though 
apparently it isn’t great for long term storage. We grew three red onion varieties as part 
of this trial, each producing beautiful   globe shaped onions, with a deep red or purple 
skin, and a similar purple colouring inside,   though they didn’t produce as well as 
most of the straw coloured varieties.  The Karmen variety had a slightly larger yield 
of slighter bigger bulbs than the other two   varieties, but a few of the onions rotted before 
they dried, and one was split at the base.  We had also grown this variety in the 
other gardens, and with similar lower   yields compared to the more typical coloured 
varieties, and a few of the bulbs split at the   base with this variety in the other gardens.
The Red Baron variety had a smaller bulb size   and the smallest yield of the three, but only 
marginally, and a few of these onions ended up   splitting at the base, and I wonder if this 
is more common among the red onion varieties  The Robelja variety was similar size 
and yield to the Red Barron variety,   but didn’t have any of the roots splitting, but 
the top or neck of the bulb was quite wide, though   with a small sample size like this it is hard to 
tell if this is a characteristic of the variety.  There is not much difference between 
these three varieties in terms of yield,   but the Red Baron variety seemed to 
produce bulbs that were tightly wrapped,   with a thinner closed neck or top, which 
might indicate that they will store better. Three of the onion varieties 
that we grew developed much more   elongated bulbs, which I have not seen before.
The Cipolle di Tropea variety produced bulbs that   looked stretched, with a range of shapes from 
more bulb like to more elongated, but they were   quite large and had beautiful dark pink coloured 
skin, that continued into the inside of the bulb.  The one bulb that I cut opened seemed separated 
into several distinct sections, which is   interesting, though I am not sure how common it is 
to the variety, or if this affects how it can be   used in the kitchen or how long it will store.
This plating of this variety included a large   Globo onion that had obviously grown 
from a misplaced seeds, and even without   this one large plant, the yield was quite 
good, but it could have been even higher.  The Long de Florence Simane variety had quite 
similar elongated bottle shaped bulbs, with a   very similar colour, and similar colouring 
inside the bulb, though with more layers.  This variety had similar yields and bulb size to 
the other elongated variety, but quite a few of   these bulbs still had green shoots, either as 
regrowth or leaves that had not dried off yet,   which were covered with a black fly or aphid.
This could be cut off for storage, but it seems   that the bulbs of this variety were not going 
into the dormant stage that was common with all   the other onions in the trial, indicating 
that they would not store for very long.  The Tosca variety had a similar elongated shape,   though more cylindrical that the 
other two, and a straw coloured skin,   and internal colouring similar to many 
of the typical straw coloured varieties.  These onions were quite a bit smaller than 
any of the other varieties in the trial,   producing the smallest yield, less than half the 
weight of some of the more productive varieties. Looking at the yields of all 
of the different varieties,   as they were laid out along the length of 
the bed, there is a definite slope, with the   plants at one end of the bed seeming to produce 
a higher yield that the plants at the other end.  This could be just a coincidence with the 
arrangement of the varieties in the bed,   especially with two of the larger 
producing varieties at one end of the bed.  But it could also be due to changing soil 
quality or fertility along the length of the bed,   with the larger yielding varieties towards one 
end of the bed having better growing conditions.  But the total harvest from this 
large bed in the Simple Garden,   including the less productive varieties, is 
significantly better than in the previous five   seasons that I have grown a big batch of onions 
as part of the crop rotation of this garden.  An overall yield of almost 9.5 kg/m2 is 
significantly better than any other year,   and a lot of this increase could be 
due to the relatively good growing   conditions that we had this past year.
Especially compared to a few crops a   couple of years ago that had really reduced 
yields due to serious issues with mildew.  But the gradual increase since then, could be 
because of improving soil health and fertility   in this garden, and the use of better disease 
resistant varieties, but until this year I had   only grown a single variety each season 
from onions sets that I had bought in.  I used to only grow onions from 
sets, partially because I felt   that they were easier, and I had also 
been put using seeds off by the not   great crops the local community farm 
was getting when growing from seeds.  This season was the first time I 
grew a large onion crop from seeds,   and I have been been pleasantly surprised with the 
results, even with all the different varieties. It was great to get a good growing season 
for this first trial of onion varieties.  But I realise that variety trials like this should 
generally be repeated over a couple of seasons,   as different varieties respond to changing 
weather patterns in different ways, and can   have different levels of disease resistance.
So I am planning another similar trial for the   same garden next year, and I have already sown 
another batch of seeds for an overwintering trial   in one of the polytunnels, and I am interested 
in harvesting them as fresh, immature plants,   as apparently some of the varieties are typically 
grown for this rather than for storage onions.  I don’t have a lot of experience growing onions 
for harvesting at different times of the year and   at different stages, and no doubt I would end up 
selecting different varieties for different uses.  I still need to figure out which of these 
varieties will store better than others, as this   is a really important factor for ensuring that we 
have access to home grown onions all year round.  And I plan keep a few onions of each 
varieties over the winter and into   the spring, essentially waiting until 
each variety degrades, sprouts or rots.  And of course another key factor that I have not 
yet explored is the taste of all these onions,   and how well they cook, and what ones are 
better for different uses in the kitchen.  But I still don’t know how to do an effective 
taste test with so many varieties of onions,   especially if I want to cook 
them in several different ways.  This will be a time consuming, 
though probably enjoyable task,   but I am not sure I’m looking forward to 
sampling raw onions from 15 different varieties."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYQKqLHvIdw,EYQKqLHvIdw,"welcome everyone to today's webinar on using hydr mulches for weed suppression and yield protection in Horticultural crops I'm Alice formiga of eorganic and this webinar will last about 45 minutes and then we'll have half an hour for questions so today I'm very excited to introduce the hydromulch research team since 2021 we've been working together on a nifa Ori funded project called mulch 20 first we'll hear from Lisa Wasco Deeter and Benjamin Weiss of Washington State University we'll hear from wakas Ahmad of North Dakota State University we will'll then hear from susette ganado of Washington State University and then finally we will hear from Project leader Greta grack of North Dakota State University who will conclude the webinar by offering some implications of This research in for um hydromulch use in Horticultural production systems as as well as potential future research directions so with that I am going to turn this presentation over to our first presenter Lisa Wasco Deeter all right well Alice thank you so much for that introduction again I'm Lisa Wasco Deeter at Washington State University and Alice already introduced the title using hydr mulches for weed suppression and yield protection in Horticultural crops I'm going to be kicking off this webinar um and I really want to highlight at the on set this is a project funded from the USDA and this is a highly collaborative project uh with the different institutions that you see listed on this slide some of the topics for this webinar we are going to provide some information with regards to the whats and the wise of hydromol we're going to talk about methods of application and what we've learned in our respective trials with small fruits as well as vegetables we're also going to highlight the economic feasibility of hydr mulches based on our research and then we'll wrap up with conclusions and some questions and discussion so let's start off with the whats what is hydromulch well hydromulch is essentially a combination of different ingredients it includes water cellulose based fibers and in our experiment you'll see that we're predominantly using recycled paper and then a tackifier which functions like a glue and helps bind those fibers and the paper together so we ultimately have a slurry that we can apply through a spray app a and it dries and it hardens into kind of like a paper mâché type material that provides some mulching functionality like the picture that you see in the lower right hand corner which is from one of our strawberry trials so why hydromulch why are we interested in this unique novel mulch alternative well for one if you're organic producer you know full well that there are very few options for Effective weed Management in organic systems and because of that a lot of organic producers rely on non-biodegradable polyethylene mulch such as black polyethylene mulch for weed suppression it also does some nice um provide some nice benefits such as promotion of crop growth however it's non-biodegradable it can persist in the environment and it doesn't remove fully from the soil so that can lead to microplastics that can contaminate our soils as well as surrounding ecosystems there are so soil biodegradable plastic mulches sometimes referred to as bdms those are really nice Alternatives there's a lot of great work on them however because of the ingredients of biodegradable plastic mulches they're not allowed for certified organic production in the United States as well as in Canada and that's because of the biobased requirement by the organic programs in both countries hydr mulches in contrast they can be made with biobased ingredients and those are organic approved they can be sprayable and we also have the ability to make them multi-functional by adding other ingredients and that's a really interesting perspective future Direction and some of the previous research has been promising and uh Dr Grim has done some of that work and will'll highlight some of our current findings um with wos taking the lead and talking about some of the trials that he's conducted in North Dakota with vegetables well C you can go ahead and take it away greetings everyone my name is vakas Samad and I'm a PhD candidate at NDSU working with Dr Greta graming um so I'll be talking about the hydromulch applicator that we used at NDSU in onion and broccoli study and then I'll explain how we prepared and apply this heral and after that I'll be focusing on the outcomes from our field studies in onion and broccoli so let's dive into it and the hatal applicator that we used for onion and broccoli study is a modification of a commercially available skid type Hydro seater as we can see in this picture it has four main components hydromulch mixer hydral spray pump spray nozzle and platform uh I'll be explaining the specification of these components in visually so the hydromulch mixer is basically a skit type Hydro seater as we can see in this top picture uh we actually use this just for the preparation or for the mixing of the hyr material uh it has a 55 gallon tank with a 2in centrifugal pump uh that is driven by a 6.5 horsepower engine uh so how does this uh hyal mixer work is that we add paper teif fire and water into this tank and with the forceful mixing of 2in pump it turns the material into a homogeneous sary form so the next component is the hydromol spray pump and uh it's a clear water 1in centrifugal pump uh that drive based on the 79cc engine uh the reason for using a smaller pump is so we can reduce uh any kind of uh extra disturbance on the soil surface and we're using this pump for the spraying of the hyals so the third component is the spray nozzle it's a 3x4 in Cross nozzle that has a 80° flat spray pattern so it can cover the surface of the raised beds uh the fourth component is the platform uh that has a three-point hitch uh to attach with the tractor and with the help of the tractor uh we were able to adjust the height of the nozzle from the surface of the planting bed so let's see the overview of how we actually prepared the hydromulch in the field hydromulch preparation and application was a two person job for us uh and we use shreded newsprint in North Dakota uh that we actually use a standard Crosscut paper shredder to shred this newsprint uh while one person actually weighs the newsprint and the other person fills the water in the tank and then we start this 2-in pump and gradually start to add the shredded newsprint into this 55 gallon tank uh while one person is working on that job um we actually what the other person focuses on the preparation of the techy fire material uh for that we filled a 55 gallon 5 gallon bucket with water and then start to mix the tackifier using this little drill uh the reason for doing that was so there is no clumps of tackifier material in the 55 gallon tank and it's thoroughly mixed with the rest of the hydromulch material so once the hydromulch material turns into a homogeneous slurry form uh we actually primed the hydromol spraying pump with the hydromulch material as we can see in this picture one person holds the hose into the 55 gallon tank and we Prime this 1in pump and after the 1inch pump is ready we adjust the height of the nozzle from the surface of the RIS beds and then we start spraying so let's look at the hydromulch application in action in this small video as we can see one person starts the spraying pump and another person is ready on the tractor uh we applied the hyal in two passes as we can see the first pass material is drying out and the second pass is being applied and we can actually notice that how smoothly it's moving and then it this spray nozzle is covering the whole surface of our raised bed with that I will dive into our field studies so the objective of these studies ised to develop and test cellulose based 100% uh liquid applied hydromulch as a biodegradable alternative to the polyethylene mulches in onion and broccoli and the hypothesis of this study was that the hydr mules will effectively spress the weeds and enhance the crop yield and quality in organic vegetable production so before I explain that how we actually choose the hydromulch formulations for our Field St IES uh our team at Montana State done some preliminary testing on the hyom mulch material and formulations and the results showed that the guarum was associated with the enhanced durability and the chamina meal had the higher rain fastness so based on those outcomes we chose our hydral formulation for the field studies uh experiments were conducted at up saraka and Fargo North Dakota for onion during 2023 and for broccoli during 24 and I will be using these abbreviations for my results so the homage formulations included Guam 3% cholina 3% Guam 6% and chalina 6% these hydromulch formulations were evaluated against the weedi check weed free check and white on black polyethylene mulch hydromulch was applied in two passes at 5,765 kg total dry matter per hectare and we transplanted onion sets and broccoli seedlings into the wet HR mulch so for these studies we collected the weed count and we counted the weeds twice during the growing season and we also determined the weat dry biomass in August 12th for the onion study and July 16th on for the broccoli study and then we also Quantified the total yield of onion and broccoli as kilogram per Hector so let's look at the outcomes for the onion field study and the picture on the left shows um the absaraka field side and this picture was taken few days after the hul application and onion transplanting so we can see how does the hydral look like and then the picture on the right side is the Fargo field side and this picture was taken right after the hul application and onion transplanting and we can see the material drying out so this first graph USS the wheat density on the x-axis so the number of weed plants per meter square and on the y axis are the treatment labels these means are presented across the site and sampling times we can notice that the polyethylene was Associated uh with no weeds so it was the best uh mulch film um while the we check has the highest number of weeds as we can see in this bar and in this picture uh all all the hydro mules were effective at stressing the weeds when we compare it with VD check uh as we noticed in this 6% guarum there are very few weeds growing in it uh while among the hydro mulches the Camina had the minimum weed expression as we notice in this picture so this graph shows the weed dry biomass as gram per meter Square on the xais and the y axis has the treatment label uh the weed check was associated with the highest we dry boms and this picture show how messy the Wy check look like and then the picture with the 6% guarum show very less amount of weed biomass growing along with the onions and all the hro mulches has performed well at expressing the weed dry biomass except the 6% chamina that was similar with Wei check this graph shows the yield for the onion on the x-axis as a kilogram per Hector and the Y AIS shows the Tre between label uh the bottom panel is for theofield side and the top panel is for the Fargo field side um the polyethylene mulch at both side has the highest onion yield and among the hyro mulches guarum formulation were the best at protecting the onion yield and if we notice in this picture uh faroy the polyethylene and the six% guarum uh showed the similar onion growth so let's dive into the field outcomes for the broccoli study on the left picture is the obser field side and the right picture shows the Fargo field side and these both pictures were taken few days after the hydromulch application and broccoli transplanting and we can notice the broccoli plants growing in there so this graph shows the wheat density as wheat plants per meter Square on the x-axis and the y axis has the treatment labels so the results for the weed density in the broccoli study showed the similar pattern as we noticed during the onion study the polyethylene had no weeds while the weed check had the highest number of weeds as we can also notice in these two pictures um all the hydr mulches were effective at expressing the weeds uh comparative to weed check and we can see that the Guam formulation we don't see any weeds in this picture and then the 6% Camina had few weeds this craft shows the weed Dy biomass on the xaxis as gram per meter square and the y axis has the polye has the treatment labels so VD Che had the highest weed dry biomass and all the hydro mulches were very effective at reducing the weed biomass as we can see in this graph and if we compare these pictures the we check is full of uh weed biomass and the guarum formulation showing uh minimum with biomass this graph shows the broccoli yield and the XX AIS as kilogram per Hector and the y- AIS has the treatment label and unfortunately we notice the yield reduction in the hydral treatment comparative to polyethylene and weed free check uh if we focus on the weed check bar uh this yield reduction is probably associated with the weed biomass that we noticed in the previous graph uh while the hydr mulches have stressed the weed biomass so this yield reduction is probably associated with some other uh parameters and we have some speculations about it um first of all we transplanted the broccoli seedlings uh into the wet hydromulch so when we spray the hydromulch we are adding a lot of water into the planting beds um and that could actually lead to the competion of the soil uh and that can stress the transplanted broccoli seedling that probably transform into the broccoli yield reduction and and other parameter is that we got a lot of rain right after the transplanting of these broccoli seedling uh so we received uh 9 to 10 inches of rain in next three two to three weeks after transplanting of broccoli and that water saturated soil would have also probably stressed the plants and that transform into the yield Direction among these hyom multes with that I will conclude these studies that the hydromulch formulations did show The Promise promising alternative results for the polyethylene and hydromulch is actually spress the weeds and reduce the weed biomass uh while the yield reduction that we noticed during the broccoli study is probably not related to the weeds um and it could be due to compressed soil at transplanting or the water water saturated soil uh due to excessive rain uh with that I will hand over to Ben Tell tell us about the hydr mching in the fruit plants hi my name is Ben Weiss I'm a graduate student at Washington State University and I'll be talking to you about the fruit trials from this project so the first trial I'll be talking about is a strawberry trial we used albian strawberry it was conducted in 2022 we did this trial at two locations at Mount Vernon Washington and at absaraka North Dakota we used a randomized complete block design with four replication in six treatments our plot Dimensions were .9 M by 4.6 M both of our mulch treatments were applied over preformed raised beds and drip tape and at both locations we applied in the spring of 2022 and then the treatments for this project or for this trial were a polyethylene film control at a 1 mm thickness hydromulch with no tackifier hydromulch with two and 6% psyllium husk and hydromulch with 2 and 6% guarum and I just want to point out that for this section of the talk anywhere you see hm I'm referring to hydr mulch then this slide shows our mulch performance so these pictures were taken in September of 2022 which is pretty close to the end of the strawberry cropping season in Mount Vernon and I want to draw your attention especially to this lower right picture and you'll notice the drip tape or drip line split the hydro mollier in that treatment that's the no tackifier treatment and I think this does a really good job of showing why we're adding tackifier to our hydromulch and the importance of tackifier so tackifier helps increase the tensile strength which is sort of the bendiness of the mulch ler and the reason we think that one split was because it didn't have tackifier and therefore was more rigid and split more easily and then to get into some data from the strawberry trial this graph is set up with weed count per 1 square meter subplot on the Y AIS and then the treatments on the xais and and we had the no tackifier and celium husk containing treatments have the most weeds uh and then the guarum containing treatments had significantly less weeds than those and finally the polyethylene film treatment had the least amount of weeds compared to all the other hydrol treatments however I'm sorry this graph is set up the same way just with yield per gram or grams per plant on the y- AIS however we didn't have changes in yield so you'll notice all of our yields were similar to one another so whether or not the greater weed pressure was there how much that actually matters to impact and yield it didn't really seem to and then similarly for fruit quality we didn't really see differences in Fruit quality and this graph is set up the same way just with titratable acidity in grams per liter pH is pH and bricks and degree bricks on the going up the Y AIS and then the treatments are in the Legend and again how much the greater weed pressure in the hydromulch treatment really matters is sort of up to interpretation but we didn't see differences in Fruit quality or yield for the strawberry trial so one of our main conclusions really our main conclusion from the strawberry trial is that hydromulch just maintained or improved strawberry yield compared to the polyethylene control we also had higher soil temperature fluctuations under hydr mulches until the canopies developed and sh the Beds which then they became very similar after that our fruit quality and plant growth was very comparable across all of our treatments and one hurdle for commercializing hydromulch in Strawberry systems is that no one has done research on how anerobic soil disinfestation would work with hydromulch we know that it's a very common practice for organic strawberry Growers so that's really the biggest hurdle hurdle to commercializing this or using this on your farm if you do indeed use Anor robic soil disinfestation and then to delve into the work I've been doing over the last two years into blueberry This research was done in procer Washington which is a very dry desert environment I used a randomized complete block design with four replications and four treatments our plot Dimensions were 1.2 M by 12.2 M The Mulch was applied over a 5-year-old certified organic blueberry planting and it we used Valor as the cultivar and it was applied in Spring 2023 and 2024 and the 2024 application was applied directly on top of the 2023 application or what was left of the 2023 application and then the treatments for this include a weedmat control and weedmat is just a woven plastic material it's made by taking little strips of plastic and very tightly weaving them together it's a very robust mulch material meant for perennial cropping systems the next two treatments are hydral with no tackifier and hydral with 4% tackifier and the reason we're interested in comparing no tackifier to 4% tackifier is that one of the findings from a previous paper was that in desert environments tackifier doesn't really have a benefit tacka fire is also the most expensive part of our formulation so if we could eliminate it that would really help the return on investment for Growers and then both of these treatments were made with Uline bogus paper which is just sort of a nondescript gray paper and it took a lot of Labor to shred it and then blend it into a hydral slurry so for our final treatment we wanted to find a material that we wouldn't have to do as much work to make into a slurry and we found a material from an Apple packing plant that's made by taking water sodium hydroxide and recycled paper and agitating it until a slurry forms this material did eliminate all of these arduous mixing steps however we realized that it did have some very significant logistical hurdles and the cost of moving around such large volumes of liquid is really just quite prohibitive so we eliminated this treatment from 2024 and for that reason I'll this treatment won't be in any of the data I'm presenting for this project I also just want to make a note here that we did get this material certified through the Washington State Department of Agriculture for use in certified organic production however there are a lot of potential contaminants in recycl paper and if you're getting recycled paper and using it in a certified organic situation you need to check with your certifier and you really should do contaminant testing it's really important you could lose your certification if you don't and then to get into some of the durability uh measurements so this graph has percent soil exposure on the Y AIS and then the month of data collection on the xais and the treatments are in The Legend and percent soil exposure Ure is just a simple measure of mulch deterioration over time it's done visually it's a qualitative measure and you'll notice the green and burgundy lines are both much higher than the purple line the green and burgundy are no tack of fire and 4% guarum respectively and they had significantly greater percent soil exposure compared to the weed map it's also interesting that the green and burgundy lines overlap and crisscross a lot and this tells me that adding tack of fire didn't really do much in this desert environment to lower uh deterioration I expect this could change if you're in a wetter environment but if you're in a very dry environment tack of fire didn't really seem to add to preventing deterioration and then these pictures just show the deterioration so the picture on the left is one of the hydromulch treatments and it was pretty common to find just large chunks missing in different places uh part of my hypothesis for this is that the tractor was catching on them in places but I can't really be sure and then on the right is one of the weed mat treatments that is very intact still and then this slide shows monocot suppression so monocot count per one meter subplot is on the Y AIS and the treatments are on the xais and hydromulch had pretty poor monocot suppression the main weeds we had a problem with were yellow nut Edge and Ry species and hydromulch had significantly more than the weed mat is a lot and then I want you to notice that the Y AIS isn't going to change between the last graph and this graph so this graph is set up the same way just with dcot count per one meter subplot and hydr mulas did suppress dcot pretty well uh they averaged less than 10 diecuts for per one meter uh transact and hydr mules did have significantly more diecuts than the weed mat control but they were low enough that at least in my opinion most Growers would find it acceptable and then this slide shows the weed biomass accumulation so on the Y AIS is biomass in grams per 1 M squared and on the x-axis are the treatments and the legend is now the CRA or the species in question and the in 2023 we had significantly more sge in the hydral treatments than the weed mat and in 2024 we had significantly more grass in the hydral treatments than the weedmap and I can't be entirely sure why this was but I have a couple of hypotheses they include that the grass could have set seed and deposited that seed on top of the hydromulch layer and then germinated and increased biomass that way or it could be that this was a perennial rise species and that the second Year's growth was just had a lot more biomass than the first Year's growth and then this slide shows yield so on the y- axis is yield in kilograms per Bush and on the x- axis are the treatments and we didn't have any significant differences in yield however this is more indicative of the field establishment and management under weedmat than it is what would happen if you establish a field with weed mat or with hydromulch and I expect you would have differences if you established a field with hydromulch due to those monocot pressures and then similarly for fruit quality we didn't have any differences but again this could change if you establish the field with hydromulch as opposed to weedmat and then some conclusions from from the blueberry trial include hydr molas maintain blueberry yield fruit quality and tissue nutrient status hydr molas did appear to suppress dcot not quite as well as weedmat but still pretty well hydr mules did not really suppress monocots especially sge and Ry grass and multi-year hydral applications could increase grass pressures and now I'll be handling it off to Dr gonado to talk to you about the economic work with this project hello everyone my name is zette gin I am an agriculture Economist in Washington State University based in pman um so let's turn to the economic visibility assessment of using hydromulch there are three important factors to consider costs benefits and net profit all compared to traditional mulch practices of these net profit is the most important factor while it is understandable to be concerned about costs it is essential to recognize that it is the net profit that sustains the business a positive net profit can be achieved when benefits outweigh the costs we are using a partial budget analysis to estimate the financial impact of switching from pulch to hydromulch based on field studies in North Dakota and Washington for organic day neutral strawberry systems this analysis focuses only on the changes that affect farm profit on the left we show the benefits of using hydromulch represented by any additional income or reduced costs compared to the Baseline of PE mulch in Washington there is no additional income from hydromulch as the field studies found no MCH effects on yield however in North Dakota yields are higher in hydromulch treatments than in P much under reduced costs we account for savings from eliminating end of season activities like removal and disposal of pulch if hydromulch material or application costs are lower than PE mulch that would also be considered a benefit on the right we list the costs when using hydro mulch under additional costs if Hydro mulch is more expensive than PE mulch it will be reflected here in this example there is no reduced income at the bottom of the table we have the net change and profit which is the difference between benefits and costs a negative value means the change will reduce form income while a positive number indicates that a change will be more profitable than the Baseline practice now um here we are looking at the data used for the partial budget analysis example let's go through the table step by step first up is the material cost um the hom much cost is based on a formulation without a tackifier the high cost material comes from an expensive source which was chosen for easier Organic certification the lowcost alternative has not been tested for hydromulch but we included it to compare how feedstock costs affect profitability for PE mulch the cost is based on using two rolls per acre each 1 M thick and 4 feet by 4,000 ft next about Libor application costs are higher for hydromulch because they include preparation for pulch labor costs also account for removal clean up and Disposal the differences in labor costs that we see in the table between North Dakota and Washington reflect the different labor rates in the states next the total yields of day neutral strawberry in the midwest range from 10,000 to 20,000 pounds per acre with 80% being marketable in North Dakota we use the lowest estimate as a baseline which is 8,000 pounds per acre of marketable yield since field studies in North Dakota showed higher yields with hydral than pulch we Ed the midpoint of the range 15,000 over all or 12,000 marketable yield to represent hydral shield and last but not least since organic strawberry price data is not available for North Dakota and Washington we use the 2023 us average wholesale price of $389 per pound in our analysis here is a graphical representation of the partial budgets in the two states given low and high material costs for hydral in North Dakota the net change in profit is positive primarily due to higher yields with hydral compared to pulch even in the high cost hydral scenario the additional income and cost savings outweigh material and application costs with a potential profit increase of about 13 $3,370 per acre in Washington on the other hand um where yield is not affected by mching practices profitability depends on input cost savings under the lowcost hydromulch scenario net profit is positive because of savings in M material and labor however in the high cost scenario net change in profit is negative because labor savings are insufficient to offset higher material and application costs resulting in a loss so when does high cost hydral become feasible hydromulch must generate at least the same profit as pulch in North Dakota this requires an additional $3,600 per acre in income or 924 pounds per acre more marketable yield at $389 per pound in Washington this condition requires an additional $3,580 per acre or 921 pound per acre more marketable yield these thresholds determine when high cost Hydro much becomes a viable alternative to p and these numbers are mainly based on the values that we use for the analysis so it can be different when we have different values what are the key takeaways in the previous slide we presented profit estimates and highlighted factors such as increased yield labor cost savings that influence profitability however the main takeaway is not the specific profit values but understanding the conditions that make hydros a competitive alternative to P it is also important to note that our current analysis is based on small scale experiments and high cost feed stocks so our results have limitations while Halal is expensive at this stage costs could decrease with larger scale production and more Affordable Feed stocks alternative feed stocks to exist that could be cheaper but they require further testing to ensure sure that they meet both performance and Organic certification requirements and moving forward our analysis of broccoli and onions in North Dakota and blueberries in Washington will consider factors such as different hydromulch formulations different feed stock costs labor rates crop yields output prices and scale of operation to refine our economic assessment well that's all I have for the economics SP thank you all right hi everyone I'm Greta gry and I'm the principal investigator for this project and I would like to give you some conclusions to wrap up this presentation some future directions this project is at its near end we will be continuing research through 2026 some of the things that remain in North Dakota we plan to test the effect of hydromulch presence in the soil on onion production so to answer a couple questions that have already been asked yes we till it in it is fully biodegradable but the presence of the hydro molch could upset the nutrient balance the carbon um has a tendency to tie up some nitrogen so that we're going to test that in a production setting but we're also testing the soil Health impacts associated ated with tilling this material into the soil and our collaborator from the USDA Sharon wires could be with us today to talk about that a lot of those measurements still haven't been um processed and analyzed so that's a component that we're still working on and as susette man um mentioned we are also still working on our economic analyses um as she mentioned as well this is a project that was conducted on a relatively small scale in relation to commercial production and so we will need to consider many issues when trying to scale up hydromulching for a a more realistic setting and also to get a better idea of what the cost would be uh we uh pretty much uh one thing that wasn't mentioned is we did a lot of tests at Montana State University and we tested some other feed stock materials U such as wood fibers and hemp herd fibers and those worked a lot less well than the cellulose um then the cellulous is also a common component of hydr mulching or hydro seeding commercial products that are available and so uh we I've been contacted by a company called profile that makes commercial hydr seeding materials and we would probably collaborate with them to develop a cellulose based product uh at some point if we got enough support for the um continuation of this idea we've also received some interest from a major Berry producer um called nature ripe and so um might be able to work with them to test the material on a larger commercial scale one thing about the tackifier so we explored using psyllium husk garum and camelina meile so the chamelin Ile is a waste product and those other two are not so it would be great to find something that was an agricultural waste product the chamina meal didn't work as well as the gar gum but but um we suspect it was due to so that's the the solids that are left over when you crush a chamina is an oil seed you crush that seed to get the oil and then the waste product is those solids we suspect that there was some remaining oil in that chamina meal that worked against its potential as ATT tackifier so we might be able to explore having um more refined uh processing of the chamina meal to make it a more suitable tackifier the guarum worked great but it's a really expensive material that we'd love to find um an alternative for um so exploring other tack fires is something that we need to do to scale this up and also we would be interested in developing alternative application methods that are crop specific so as wakas was mentioning we felt that plant ing the tender broccoli seedlings into the hydromulch may have set them back a little bit and we did work with a farmer the picture on your right shows a A system that he was working on whereby you would um plant the seedlings first using a a typical transplanter attachment and then at the bottom of the picture you can see there's two nozzles coming out that would apply the hydromulch on top of the seedlings and that may be a better approach for those kinds of tender seedlings the way we did it in our studies when we planted the crops after the hydromulch application worked great for strawberries and it worked great for onions too and so those are a number of things that we would need to look at before we scale this up and I know that people are interested in trying this them eles and we can talk about that in in the questions I saw there was a question about that um and I think I'll just stop there maybe um give uh some acknowledgments again people that helped us out with the project all of our respective institutions also mention again that this was funded by oi Grant which is a nifa grant part of the USDA and I think we'll move on to questions on this slide there are several QR codes that you can use to access um a website for the project and um the E Organics uh page and so with that we'll close it out and take some questions thanks everyone thank you Greta and thank you everyone um we'll be moving on to our Q&A I know we've got a lot of questions coming in right now so I'm just going to pull up my Q&A box here and go through some of the questions I know we've had some really great ones coming in and I'm just going to start with one of the last ones while I'm getting ready here um because um I thought it was a really funny question um somebody asked what about um using prec consumer toilet paper I live near Green Bay the toilet paper cap capital of the world or the country and lots of toilet paper is damaged during manufacturer and may be available um I know that one thing that Ben said was really important in this regard which is whatever you do use you have to get it approved by your organic certifier if you're certified granny but does anybody want to comment on that um it turns out that to manufacture to toilet paper uh the machines use forever chemicals or posos and so all of the commercial toilet paper that you use is contaminated with past and so I don't know if that would be uh potentially um useful material especially for organic use um I don't know it's probably a very small amount of posos but it would probably be something that people would be concerned about yeah we had a couple other um sort of Rel questions um we had a comment that um in Maine there's um they've had some issues with um pasas in biosolids from paper mills and um someone else was wondering about the ink content in paper utilized for Organic certification requirements yeah I can I can address that as well and this is a really interesting question that I've had some grappling with personally because years ago so I tried to get a material a mulch material made out of wool certified and my certifi is very stringent by the way and they would not let me they wouldn't approve this material because the mulch was dyed with a green soy based dye and so I didn't use it and then when we started working on this project I found out uh when we first started doing little test trials we were using virgin newsprint which would not be contaminated with ink it actually works a little bit better than the the recycled paper but then I found out that for The Organic certification we would need to use recycled paper and it is allowed in the organic standards and they don't address the ink component even though I would venture to Guess that most recycled paper will have some residual ink content and that's a good example of what I think is some discrepancy in the organic standards they're not perfect and they can sometimes be contradictory um such as the example I'm talking about uh but it it remains that recycle paper is allowed for organic um use in the United States whether or not it contains some ink residues a little bit more about the material and the development of a commercial product product we would work with a company that could produce a product with as low toxicity as possible and it would be omry labeled so that there would be at least no worries with getting certified uh but in this world I think it's very unrealistic to think that we're going to live uh free of toxic substances and so I'll leave it there thank you um okay so um we have a couple questions about the mulch in different um climates and weather conditions so um how does the mulch behave after rain in terms of it getting washed away with rain or showing cracks due to repeated drying and wetting Cycles I know that was part of the material testing but does anyone one want to talk more about that I know wakas knows a lot about that maybe he can take that one and Ben can chime in sure so actually we did get some rain after we sprayed during our onion study at one of our locations um and the material is actually it did not just wash away it was pretty resilient to the rain and it still stayed on the surface of the bed and we did get pretty good suppression for the weeds U but we do think that the rain did impact a little bit uh for the the durability of the of the material um or for the suppression ability of the material for the weeds uh but it did not completely wash away and we were still able to get pretty good suppression for the weeds cost to avoid damage altogether how many hours would you like to see that hydromulch dry before you get a rain uh so actually uh if we don't get rain and if the day is a complete sunny day uh with a temperature about 70 Fahrenheit I think it will take 3 4 hours for the material to dry out and depends on the clouds if we have clouds it can take longer for the material to dry but it it do dry pretty quick if we have a sunny day within like two three hours right so once it's dry it's actually very resistant to damage from rain in fact last year in our broccoli trial I think we had about 10 inches of rain the first couple of months it was I was about ready to start building an arc so it was it was pretty resilient to that rainfall after it dried and I want to mention another thing so any if we don't get rain we are we are actually uh irrigating the plants using the drip irrigation so that also um makes the hom mulch material um get wet after every irrigation period so uh this material is even if it is wet it still stay on the soil surface and it does it job for stressing the weeds um that's what we noticed during our study so even if we're not getting rain we still irrigating it and causing the water to actually get soaked into that material and it's wet but it's still staying on the surface and doing its job and just to add on to that um there's I've been pretty curious about what would happen to hydromulch in tropical storms in places like Florida specifically and there's research from 2006 the author's name is Warick um they did use slightly different paper hydral like their formulation was a little different but they didn't have any issues with it getting destroyed in a you know hurricane type weather either so at least they didn't report it they did so there's at least some evidence that you know it would be okay in a tropical storm um yeah we had a related question um about whether how well hydromulch might hold up in warm humid conditions such as Florida so you just mentioned the hurricane it might withstand the hurricane but what about um prolonged humidity um and um Johan who asked the question was wondering about also about the effect on microorganisms soil pathogens and nematodes um that that research was done in Florida so it it held up for them um I don't I can't really answer the other part but the research on that the pest and the soil microorganism component just hasn't been done yet and there are is some soil health work that's being done by Dr wiers and that includes some um microbial components but at this point we're not able to answer that question but because the material is predominantly cellulose it is going to degrade faster so there was a question about biodegradability and uh Greta addressed it as well but I just want to point out that it is cellulose it's one of the most fastest degrading um polysaccharide or material that can be used as a mulch so it will biodegrade um in some cases it biod degrades quite rapidly along the edges where there's contact with soil and moisture because the higher temperature combined with the moisture can cause some more rapid deterioration but on the surface it stays intact I can add to that a little uh even though I'm not aware of research that has specifically addressed various pests and pathogens we didn't notice observationally anything that would make me suspect that the hydr mulches could be a culprit or exacerbate issues like that but we do need to have some research done about that issue so good question yeah um we had another question about how much water you're putting down with the hydromulch on the plot because um Rebecca is wondering about longer term effects on soil moisture well I could talk about it a little bit there it does contain a fair amount of water that soaks into the soil I would say that it wets about the first maybe half inch of soil if it's dry and and then it's just like getting a rain it would be like getting a a light rain uh if I had to guess it would be like getting a quarter inch of rain or something like that I hope that answers your question we it the issue does sometimes complicate the transplanting a little bit but in terms of affecting the crops in terms of water use I I think it's probably NE negligible and I can also add into it so the recipe that we used for the for our H formulation we added 35 L of water to 1.25 kg of dry matter so that's what was our recipe for making the hyom formulation uh in when we talk about the ratio of water to dry matter maybe maybe at some point w cost you can calculate how much water that is going in on a per meter squared basis or something like that that's something we haven't calculated okay um we have a question about whether this has been done on a smaller scale application um because um seoa says um she doesn't have the the scale of equipment that you had so are there any smaller ways to apply hydromulch that you know of that might be done on a smaller scale yeah so prior to getting this grant I worked on a smaller Grant where I tested these ideas on a much smaller scale and we use uh we still mixed the material using this commercial Hydro seater has a really powerful pump but I have thought about using a commercial immersion blender I think that you could Shred the paper and then use an immersion blender to blend it up and then in this smaller trial what we did was we used a backpack sprayer I don't know if you're familiar with a solo backpack sprayer but there's others that are used for spraying herbicides or other liquid treatments in agriculture but it's a manual um backpack sprayer that's pressurized with a hand pump and we just use that to you know kind of manually apply the hydr mulch to the soil surface and on a really small scale if you want wanted to try it out that would work I it would be more difficult to achieve a really even application with that methodology but that's an idea for how someone could try it on a smaller scale also just to add a little onto that um we were mixing it by hand for our blueberry trial and we found the the easiest tool to use was a grout mixing drill and a drywall attachment um and it is pretty laborious but it is also it works and you can blend up a you know 40 gallon trash can of it in maybe 15 minutes um assuming the paper's already shredded okay great we have lots of questions coming in still and we still have another 15 minutes or so so this is a great discussion um okay so another question about news okay with newsprint becoming the 21st century dodo bird and the toxic potential with recycled paper any thoughts on materials like sawdust which um which was tested and or chopped straw or other materials I know Greta mentioned cellul there's lots of previous studies about this and people have used wheat straw uh rice Hull spent mushroom cultivation substrate and any number of um organic materials cellulosic materials the the straw um sawdust wood fibers tend to not stick together very well that's one of the virtues of the cellulose or paper based fibers they um tend to form a more cohesive layer uh but I think that it is possible that we could work with as I mentioned before a a company that specializes in developing these sorts of products and they would be able to for one thing access materials on a scale that would bring the cost down and also work to get the material arm relabeled so that it would be as clean as possible but I again in in this day and age I don't know if you're ever going to be able to achieve something that's 100% free of any type of contaminant and so that that would be nice but I I don't know if it's realistic did anyone try organic rice holes yeah there's a paper that uses that material we did not because rice is not uh something that's grown around here I I think generally people are looking ideally it would be great to use a material that's locally available as a agricultural waste or byproduct okay um I just want to um read the answer that susette um wrote to Enrique who had asked about the costs um so susette wrote that um currently we only have estimated the per acre cost of material and application in organic strawberry depending on the hydromel formulation the cost ranges from 4,000 to 9,000 per acre and the high cost is mainly because of the expensive feed stock used in our field studies and the smallscale experiments we will look at conditions that will decrease this cost in our ongoing economic analysis so stay tuned so yeah um on this page you can also see the link to our project website so we will be posting future Publications and articles and you can see the ones that have already been there on this website if you want to learn more so um on with more questions here does this system assume a tilled weed-free field did you test results on a field with established tough weeds like Fescue uh no you we are we we were using raised beds to make those beds you would till them first and then build the bed with a Bel a bed shaping attachment uh there may still be propagules some of the studies that we conducted still had propagules of Canada thisle and that's going to be one that it does not help with that very much if you've got perennial weeds that are growing from Vegeta propagules those have a lot of energy and uh force behind them as they REM uh emerge and so a lot of those tougher weeds I don't think that it's going to be that successful okay does anyone else have a thought about that yeah um in the blueberry trial in procer it's a 5-year-old planting so there were uh diesel plants trying to grow through from the alleyway to some degree I noticed um it did seem like it suppressed them to some degree but not entirely and then it's also my hypothesis for part of the reason we had such issues with uh sge and Ry is that they were you know already present in the beds and then had the energy to grow through and you know assuming it was perennial R they're both perennial weeds in Eastern Washington okay um so a couple um questions about transplanting so just to clarify did the mulch dry out before transplanting the strawberry for a few hours or for another day in general we used to in in North Dakota anyway we use two passes and a lot of times we would apply a pass on one day and then the next day another pass and I would say that the material was still damp but not completely wet when we transplanted we did another study uh with another Grant and for that study the mulch was dry when we planted into it and we used a drill with a circular hole drilling attachment to just punch holes it's pretty hard when it dries but that was also successful using this um whole puncher but I I think that it would be better to plant into it when it's still not quite fully dry or plant and then apply it on top of your planting which is something that we worked on a little bit but weren't able to fully assess yeah that was kind of the next question which was doesn't transplanting after application disturb The Mulch and expose soil for weed germination yeah it just depends on the crop and that's why when I was talking about refining application methodologies I think for some crops it would be better to plant first and then apply the hydromulch but for something like strawberry the the bare roots are inserted we used have a little tool that looks like a a metal um little metal rod a flat piece of metal rod and it the hole that it makes in the mulch is Tiny and so it doesn't really expose that much soil um around the plant itself and the same was the case for the onion just depends on the crop okay great thank you um let's see um a couple one more comment here um just about the the person who asked about the um Fescue Fields um she doesn't think it's necessarily feasible to do that wild blueberry Fields where perennial weeds abound and that's probably true um and then um we have another question from Johan I know this is an organic seminar and part of an Ori Grant but it would be interesting to look at this in conventional a which accounts for the majority of plastic mulch used yeah that's a a great comment and as I mentioned in my concluding comments I have had conversations with the head of research at nature rpe which is one of the biggest Berry producers in the US and they are they were interested in triing it not just in organic but they also have non-organic systems the big problem though is that the plastic mulch in the conventional systems is also used in conjunction with soil fumigants and the plastic is integral to hold those fumigants in and I suspect that the hydro would not work quite as well for that so there would be some issues in trying to um mesh all those different functions together but the work hasn't been done and so that would be another area that could be explored great um okay we have a last comment here about maybe spraying hydromulch and transplanting at the same time would work for some vegetable crops and I know that that was attempted and have some videos on our website um from a couple years ago um which show an attempt at doing and I already talked about that we worked with a farmer he had a trans a twers transplanting rig on his tractor and also a hydromulch applicator and it would move along and in one pass the people would plant the tender seedlings I think we were using a a baras of some sort and then right behind it the hydromulch came in and would apply on top of those transplanted seedlings and I kind of thought that the force of it which is not that great but there is some force from the material exiting the nozzles I thought that might damage the seedlings but they were surprisingly resilient to it and they were just fine uh unfortunately the farmer who was working on this 4S got another job and quit the project and so we were not able to fully assess that method of transplanting first and then applying the hydr mulch but I think based on what we learned in our initial trials I think it has potential great any concluding or final remarks um before we close down been a great discussion I just want to thank everyone for all these great questions and mention again that this webinar was recorded and we will have it on the E organic YouTube channel as well as on our project website and the eorganic website within the coming week and we hope you can join us next week for two more webinars one on spotted wing dropa and one on organic anerobic soil disinfestation so thank you so much Greta Ben Lisa and wakas and susette and Sharon who's not here but um she contributed to this presentation as well as D prit paja so thank you very much and um we hope to see you again thank you so much everyone thank you much thank you"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUFnG4u5L4,QkUFnG4u5L4,hello hello my dear good farmers my viewers i hope you are good this is your farmer okay farmer i'm here for an exciting episode uh that you all like and that will enlighten us when we are farming and specifically when we are doing bad onion um i'm not in the farm i'm in the office because every business requires you to think meditate before you go to the to the practical part of it putting the seed into the soil and i'm talking about this crop that we use but onion let me pick some view here to show you look at this very very good onion look at this very clean very good onion look at this wow when you when the first skin comes out it still look very good uh today we are discussing about budgeting of onions because it's a very critical thing before you get into the soil you have to do a proper budget a budget that will help you monitor your progress monitor your expenses because you're not just farming you're farming so that you can get a return and a good return out of the crop this is kefaa kanji remember to subscribe share like so that we can reach to as many farmers as possible and be able to sustain our food production here in our motherland kenya also in africa that's my aim so budgeting is very big for onions the items that should be there and should be considered before getting into the soil but i will not handle all of them 400 in another episode at the others but i will handle only three factor very key factors in budgeting the very first one i will handle about the seat the second one for handle about water and that one i will handle about finances i'll add another fourth one um which is the method okay i will join that in what are the method of irrigation so i'll deal with three there are about 10 factors but for today what you need to submit to two and then we'll do the rest but before we go on i want to tell you that you have to form quality quality quality that is the key thing this is an onion you can't hold i can't hold it completely i call it super medium onion it's about 150 grams it's a large onion you can see i can't hold it it's around about 170 grams i have a medium sized onion this is for the home use purpose most of our customers will always like this and there is another onion here kind of super medium a very good onion for home use you see the big onions they have their clients you have people who want these big audience their supermarket that won't be big honest their institution that want this big one and so when you're farming you have to know your your client who is your customer who do you want to deliver because let me tell you from us we don't ma we don't care more if you're doing it about the pricing what you should consider or what you should factor in very carefully is the yield per unit area of per acre what are you able to produce i can be producing 10 times another farm 20 tons another farmer doing less than 10 times six eight which is very unfortunate the difference will come for that past son who is doing the higher tonnage assuming um we're in the low season of honest and i do twenty tons of ornaments and the pricing is at 30 calories do you know i'll get 20 by by 30 i'll get 460 000 yeah is it 20 by 3 yes 180 000 another custom another farmer does thing and the price is just that you get 300. there is a the difference is heaven and not like heaven and that but basically the budget is our topic today what do you do or what are the key factors do we put in the budget for you to produce quality and quantity in terms of onions the very first aspect that we look is the finances what do you have it's a business like any other you have to have some money you have to have a cash flow of money you need to have money for labor you have to need money for sale you have money for fuel a lot of aspects will be driven by your finances finances to install three finances to install that machinery to pump your water you have to have it for onion if you're doing uh there is there is two parts of finances that you have to do for startup there is the operational costs and then there is a capital cost the fixed cost for example like the cost of machine for pumping water data capital cost is a fixed cost and then there is the operation cost like the cost of seed cost of water water paying your workers that an operation because it revolves around a cycle for drip irrigation i do it and it's range between 120 150 000 depending on you how you're monitoring your operation for furrow irrigation sometimes gets expensive due to the pumping of of uh water and that will get you about 200 some do even 250 but you can manage it at 200. those are the operation costs when i'm talking of operation cost i'm talking about the buying of seed paying workers farm input can we cause such things but when you go to the capital expenses for drip irrigation it's quite expensive you have to have another cost of buying the three brands the start connectors the the plug bean work that will take the tank 100 between 200 and 300k depending on the quality that you want so that is the factor number one when you're doing your budget you have to have finances so in total if you are starting up with a capital x pens of 250 and a capital operation experience of 150 you can start the trip irrigation system i normally tell farmers start small don't start small and then you advance as you go for fire irrigation the the capital expense is not that much and they what what what what is not monitored so when is the operation caused under fire irrigation because of the pumping of water so that is it point number one point number two very important the seed this what will give you peace the seed always go for hydrate don't you use a shortcut go for hybrid feel that pain when you're buying an expensive hybrid hybrid are good because they give you the best they give you the best damage they give you the best quality something else that you look when doing the seeds even if it is a hybrid you have to to look for hybrid that maturity of that hybrid do you want a crop that will stay in the farm no do you want a crop that will take with mature very fast and give you time to do as many cycles in that year uh if you do then the onions that mature between 80 and 90 days and they will produce well depending on the location of your area go for [Music] higher breeds that will mature away this is the reason the reason is you can in an ear you can comfortably do three three cycles if you program yourself well you can do three pro three cycles or two cycle and you do a intimidate or a stop gap crop in between your program so that's a factor the factor three in under seed is that you have to look for a seed that has a long shelf life it's skipping capacity capacity acid that you keep for you can store it for 10 you see like this on a well keyword this onion i can the moisture the way it is i can comfortably store it for even to up to four months and a good shade i can do four months with this that is that factor the last factor is water for today water you have to use to have a reliable source of water don't experiment don't rely on the rainfall the rainfall regime fails and can feel terribly the source of water whether you're doing a walkway a river a dam that source of water has to be reliable the cubic uh the metacubic that you can extract from your bowel from your down has to be well calculated so that it can complete the cycle especially in these areas that you are living in where the the rainfall patterns have really changed so that your reservoir has to you have to be very sure on the the quantity that the capacity that it can hold for you for the entire growth of crop onions require they don't consume a lot of water yes but there are times they require a lot of water during planting in the nursery after at week one up to two at week six bubbling stage they require a lot of water so you have to prepare yourself for that factor so for today let's break at that that's uh three points for budgeting point number one finances point number two water point number three the seed so thank you very much my dear good farmers kindly remember to subscribe remember to share we all do this for the sake of sharing knowledge not any other thing so go to my youtube channel kefab share the knowledge with another farmer and by that if we do a good production the the cost of food will come down and i normally say if we have enough food in the economy you're going to drive it so we cannot do that when you're having an empty stomach goodbye have a nice time
