In this symbiosis, the rural world plays a fundamental role as a guarantor of our food and of many other services that sustain life and preserve the health of our ecosystems. And if something balances the three aspects - health, planet and rural world - it is ecological production and agroecology which, in times of pandemic and climate emergency, are configured as the best strategy to demand a comprehensive response to this socio-economic crisis. ecological current, addressing all those links between agriculture and health.
Thus, under the gaze of experts and initiatives in the agroecological field that range from local to international, it is expected to explore, from a transdisciplinary and multisectoral approach, different issues involved in this single health concept: the role of organic production and short channels, human and animal health as interdependent and linked to ecosystems or public policies that should favor agroecological strategies for the transition of our food systems.},

The uncontrolled release of toxins, the loss of biodiversity, the shortage of energy and materials, the emission of greenhouse gases, etc., derived from human activity has caused an exponential increase in temperatures at all levels, the proliferation of meteorological effects increasingly intense and frequent adverse events, loss of soil and genetic resources, with very serious consequences on health and social justice. Each of these consequences turn into causes that lead to other effects, generating feedback chains.
If we do not address the bases of the problems as they are and at the same time we are able to analyze them and understand them as a whole, we will not be able to act with the effectiveness, rigor and efficiency that this
situation requires.
For the first time, international institutions are requiring indicators of impact and are conditioning the aids, such as the Common Agricultural Policy, to the achievement of environmental, social and economic objectives.
SEAE wants to contribute to the debate and the generation of indicators that show and assess the impact of our food production activity on our
soil, climate, biodiversity, water and human well-being. It is a challenge for researchers,administrations, productive sector and society in general.}

Organic production thus plays a dual societal role, where, on the one hand, it provides for a specific market responding to consumer demand for organic products and, on the other hand, it delivers publicly available goods that contribute to the protection of the environment and animal welfare, as well as to rural development and social sustainability. Organic production differs from conventional agricultural production in that it is based on production rules laid down in the EU regulation on organic production and labelling of organic products. In Finland, organic producers are committed to adhering to the control of organic production as coordinated by the Finnish Food Authority, and they can use the EU organic label in their products. According to the organic production conditions, the use of synthetic crop protection agents and inorganic fertilisers, for example, is not permitted. Furthermore, organic domestic animals must be able to graze, and they must be fed using organic feed. In the processing of food products, strict restrictions have been imposed on the use of additives and processing aids, as well as chemically produced synthetic raw materials.},

We hypothesized that CHA and GCC would sustain higher spring and autumn daily gain oflambs compared with GCM. In Exp.1, 12 twin-rearing ewes together with their 24 lambs were randomly allocated into three sward types replicated twice (n= 2 ewes, 4 lambs/ replicate) and monitored for 25 d before sending to mountain pasture. In Exp.2, 24 weaned lambs from the mountain pasture were again randomly allocated to one of the above pasture types and grazed for 28 d. We observed differences in chemical composition and estimated energy values between swards containing chicory and GCM swards. However, these did not affect lamb performance during both experiments, contrary to our previous findings, suggesting that
grazing sheep either selected against chicory, or the observed differences in chemical composition among sward types were not strang enough to influence performance, or a combination of the two possible effects.}

It intends to ensure fair conditions for all stakeholders of the food chain along with responsible consumption. FAO recently declared that organic farming can enhance food security, rural development, sustainable livelihoods and environmental integrity by building capacities of stakeholders in organic production, processing, certification and marketing worldwide. The revised EU regulation to be implemented in 2021 will affect the import of organic products from third parties, and there is a need to understand how and develop efficient ways for its success. However, it still a small sector, African Ecological Organic Agriculture (EOA) is gaining success through the Ecological and OA Initiative (EOA-I) as confirmed during the last African Organic Conference held in Sally-Dakar (Senegal) in November 2018. African organic stakeholders and decision makers along with scientists were unanimous that African governments, continental and regional institutions, development partners, donors and private sector investors, should provide more support to develop OA in Africa. The conference intends to boost the cooperation between organic stakeholders in Africa with many countries at multilateral level. Organic expertise will be strengthened for the benefit of all African countries. Objectives of the conference ? Merge a critical mass of scientific capacity and skills from Europe and Africa, to deliver sustainable solutions by working at practical and theoretical level; ? Bring together high profiled scientists from both continents to discuss issues about organic inputs, innovation, organic research funding, ethics and address recommendations to relevant certification and regulation bodies; ? Address and confront African potentials to expand traditional organic agriculture in terms of genetic, agro-climatic and sociocultural diversity; ? Strengthen the "Organic Alternatives for Africa" initiative and to facilitate the integration of OA into strategic policies and the agricultural development program ? Discuss how OA in Africa can be further developed as a sustainable and reliable model to ensure food safety for all, in the framework of the AAA Initiative following the COP22 recommendations (Marrakesh, Morocco 2016) ? Discuss the main question raised from the conference title: How can research contribute to bridge the current gap between Africa and Europe, with respect to organic agriculture?},

EU?s {\o}kologiforordning definerer {\o}kologisk produktion som et samlet system for landbrugsdrift og f{\o}devareproduktion, der kombinerer bedste praksis p{\r a} milj{\o}- og klimaomr{\r a}det, en h{\o}j grad af biodiversitet, bevarelse af naturressourcer og anvendelse af h{\o}je dyrevelf{\ae}rdsstandarder og h{\o}je produktionsstandarder i overensstemmelse med stadig flere forbrugeres eftersp{\o}rgsel efter produkter, der produceres ved anvendelse af naturlige stoffer og processer. 
{\O}kologisk produktion spiller s{\r a}ledes en dobbeltrolle i samfundet, hvor den p{\r a} den ene side forsyner et specifikt marked, der im{\o}dekommer forbrugernes eftersp{\o}rgsel efter {\o}kologiske produkter - og p{\r a} den anden side leverer samfundsgoder, der bidrager til beskyttelsen af klima og milj{\o}, biodiversitet, dyrevelf{\ae}rd samt landdistriktsudvikling. Desuden er {\o}kologiens fire grundl{\ae}ggende principper om sundhed, retf{\ae}rdighed, {\o}kologi og forsigtighed t{\ae}t knyttede til FN?s verdensm{\r a}l, som anerkender, at social, {\o}konomisk og milj{\o}m{\ae}ssig udvikling er t{\ae}t forbundne, og kr{\ae}ver en integreret indsats. 
ICROFS forskningsstrategi skal derfor underst{\o}tte {\o}kologiens udvikling b{\r a}de med henblik p{\r a} at forsyne markedet og opfylde samfundets behov. 
Fokusomr{\r a}der og succeskriterier 
Gennem seks fokusomr{\r a}der adresserer strategien de centrale udfordringer og potentialer i {\o}kologisk jordbrug og f{\o}devaresystemer med henblik p{\r a} at underst{\o}tte en markedsdrevet og konkurrencedygtig {\o}kologisektor, im{\o}dekomme forbrugernes og samfundets forventninger til sunde kvalitetsf{\o}devarer, og ikke mindst at bidrage til b{\ae}redygtighed og samfundsgoder.
De seks fokusomr{\r a}der: 
? CIRKUL{\AE}R BIO{\O}KONOMI 
? KLIMA OG MILJ{\O} 
? BIODIVERSITET 
? SUNDHED OG VELF{\AE}RD 
? FREMTIDENS {\O}KOLOGISKE FORBRUGER 
? {\O}KOLOGIEN SOM LEVEVEJ 
Strategien sigter efter praksisn{\ae}re l{\o}sninger, og forskning, som udf{\o}res i et t{\ae}t samarbejde mellem landm{\ae}nd, virksomheder, myndigheder, forbrugere og forskningsmilj{\o}er med henblik p{\r a} at udvikle innovative og konkurrencedygtige l{\o}sninger og dokumentere disse i forhold til forbrugerne og samfundet. Det afspejler sig i f{\o}lgende fire centrale succeskriterier for de forskningsprojekter, der {\o}nskes fremmet: 
? B{\AE}REDYGTIGHED ? projekterne skal bidrage til b{\ae}redygtige produktionssystemer, som beskytter klima og milj{\o}, baserer sig p{\r a} recirkulering og b{\ae}redygtig ressourceudnyttelse, samt underst{\o}tter en h{\o}j grad af biodiversitet, dyrevelf{\ae}rd og sundhed for jord, planter, dyr og mennesker 
? INNOVATION ? projekterne skal bidrage til innovative produktionssystemer, der im{\o}dekommer forbrugernes og samfundets eftersp{\o}rgsel p{\r a} {\o}kologiske varer 
? V{\AE}KST ? projekterne skal bidrage til produktive og effektive produktionssystemer, som underst{\o}tter fortsat b{\ae}redygtig v{\ae}kst i den {\o}kologiske produktion 
? TROV{\AE}RDIGHED - projekterne skal bidrage til {\o}kologiens trov{\ae}rdighed i forhold til de grundl{\ae}ggende principper og bidraget til samfundsgoder som beskyttelse af klima, milj{\o} og drikkevand, samt en h{\o}j grad af biodiversitet og dyrevelf{\ae}rd}

-	Feed 9 to 11 billion people in the next 30 to 80 years with enough, affordable and healthy food.
-	Protect the environment (e.g. soils, water, air, biodiversity and landscapes) whilst increasingly under pressure to achieve greater levels of intensification.
-	Mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change in all farming systems and value chains.
-	Incorporate novel ethics, food habits, demographics and lifestyles into the food chains.
-	Produce food on limited farmland and fossil (non-renewable) resources efficiently and profitably.
Several findings from scientific research and practical applications suggest that organic food and farming systems can help in tackling these future challenges.1The 'low external input' approach, risk minimizing strategies and ethically accepted production practices of organic food and farming systemscan help to produce more affordable food for an increasing number of people while minimizing environmental impacts. However, resource efficiency, low-meat diets and reducing food waste are also essential factors that have to be considered.
From a global perspective, organic food and farming systems is still a niche sector, as less than 1\% of global farmland is managed organically and only a small proportion of the global population is consuming organic food in significant amounts. Production yields are relatively low, and the goals of organic food and farming systems, described in the principles and standards, are not achieved on every farm. This needs further development based on scientific evidence and good management practices.
A lot has been done already to develop organic food and farming systems. Nevertheless, to assure, that organic food and farming systems becomes a significant part of the solutions for the future challenges in the food and farming sector, there is still much to do.
The Scientific Track at the Organic World Congress 2017 in Delhi, India, will contribute to the global discussion on Organic 3.0, and taking the opportunity to answers some of the challenges in the context of the Indian subcontinent in particular. After a double-blind review, done by 120 reviewers from various disciplines from many experienced research institutions throughout the world, about 183papers from 50 countries have been accepted.

For both reasons, SEAE has been organizing, since the early 1990s, its congresses every two years, which has been consolidating a space of encounter and dialogue between all the actors of the agri-food ecological chain(producers, processors, consumers, marketers, etc.) and researchers, consultants,
trainers, authorities, certifiers, to share experiences, advances and technical-scientific progress to solve the productive problems of the ecological operators, without forgetting the environmental aspects, social and political issues at the state level. This space has been extended since 2002 to the whole Iberoamerican fiedl.
During the congress, the ordinary General Assembly of the SEAE is held, in which, in addition to discussing
on topics of the present and future of the association, management positions are renewed and Ecolabora prizes are awarded. In 2016 this prize achieves its third edition.
Lugo, the agrarian capital of Galicia, where agrosilvopastoral systems predominate, has been chosen for this edition,that integrate agriculture, livestock and forest. The theme of the event is this time to highlight the

Various stakeholders have shown a growing interest in organic food and farming (OF\&F), which has become a widespread issue at all levels of society. However, much debate still arises about the value of OF\&F as a model for sustainable agriculture. Rather than questioning whether organic farming performs better or not than conventional farming, the main question addressed in this book is how and under what conditions OF\&F may contribute to sustainable agricultures. Multiple forms are emerging today, among which OF\&F represents a prototype, evolving in strong interaction with them and tackling the multiple challenges facing sustainable agriculture.

This book presents 25 papers divided into three main sections. The first section investigates OF\&F production processes and the capacity of OF\&F to benefit from ecological regulations and system functioning to achieve a greater degree of self-sufficiency. The second one proposes an overview of organic performances that provide commodities and public goods in response to societal demands. The third focuses on how to mainstream different forms of organic agriculture, including development pathways for organic farming and up-scaling within agri-food systems and territories.

In addition to a strong theoretical component, this book provides an overview of the current challenges facing OF\&F. It questions the successes and limitations of organics, with particular emphasis on bottlenecks and lock-in effects at various levels, highlighting recent innovations and presenting a critical appraisal of the state of the art of existing knowledge. It contributes to our understanding of the perspectives and future challenges for research in organic farming in France and in Europe.

Each area of OF\&F is examined, with papers from leading experts who have been involved in organic research projects and partnerships for many years and who provide complementary insights into the key issues facing organic agriculture and research worldwide.

Several NJF seminars have been arranged to highlight organic food and agriculture, bringing together experts from different branches of sience, from ecology to economics. This seminar in Denmark 2013 is part of this chain of seminars, which started in Alnarp, Sweden 2005 and was followed by Tartu, Estonia in 2009. This seminar is organized in collaboration with ICROFS - International Centre for Research in Organic Food Systems and EPOK - Centre for Organic Food and Farming at Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences.

 Organic agriculture has grown to a sector with profound impact on the societal and agricultural development. Hence, we want to utilize the upcoming seminar to reveal how organic research has contributed, or may contribute to change the many and serious challenges that we face to protect our environment and to ensure a satisfactory living for all. Concurrently, the needs for improvement in practical farming systems, both to support the farmers and to further develop organic farming in a sustainable direction, must be emphasized.

 The objective of the seminar is to encourage the seminar participants to discuss relevant main challenges and how research and developmental work can be more efficiently directed to solve problems in organic farming systems, based on the overview of work presented during the seminar. The seminar should inspire the participants, and make them better equipped to utilize their work to solve problems in relation to (organic) farming, as they are challenged to reflect the impact of their work in a broader context. 
 
Topics 
The seminar program is arranged around the following four tracks:
 1. Societal and economic viability
 2. Transition to renewable resources 
 3. Nutrient sufficiency and management in farming systems 
 4. Productivity and sustainable production levels in animal and crop production

 Download the final programme to see the topics that will be covered in these tracks. 
 
Keynote speakers 
Opening speech "Organic farming meets future food and environmental challenges" will be given by Elisabeth Gauffin, Sweden, a dairy farmer and the president of KRAV - Swedish Association for Standards in Organic Agriculture and Food.

 There are four track experts and each of them will give an introductory key-note speech about major challenges related to the respective track:

 Track 1: "The organic sector as an innovation system" by Dr. Susanne Padel, Principal socio-economic researcher, The Organic Research Centre, Elm Farm, UK.

 Track 2: "Energy balance comparisons of organic and conventional farming systems and potentials for the mitigation of fossil resource use" by Dr. Tommy Dalgaard, Head of Agro-Environmental Management MSc Programme, Department of Agroecology, Aarhus University, Denmark.

 Track 3: "Long-term management of nutrients in organic farming - principles and practice" by Dr. Christine Watson, Leader of the Soils Research Team, Scotland's Rural College, UK.

 Track 4: "Is agroeclogy the most suitable approach for all organic farming systems? by Prof. Paolo B{\`a}rberi, Professor of Agronomy and Field Crops, Institute of Life Sciences, Sant?Anna School of Advanced Studies, Italy.

 The track experts have participated in planning the programme and will contribute to discussions in the sessions and take part in the final plenary session in summing up major conclusions.

The surface mulching of potatoes affected the soil temperature (higher about 0.2 ? 1.6 ?C than in C) and water potential of the soil (higher only by 8 kPa than in C). GM had a significant effect on the yield of ware potatoes. The final tuber yield was higher by 22.9 \% on plots with GM in comparison with C.

Du sidder lige nu med sidste nyt fra forskningsprogrammet F{\O}JO III, som l{\o}ber i perioden 2006-2010. Projektlederne for de 15 F{\O}JO III projekter har bidraget med de seneste forskningsresultater, og ICROFS har samlet det hele i denne brochure.
M{\r a}let med F{\O}JO III er at skabe mere viden om potentialet for at {\o}ge kvaliteten og konkurrencedygtigheden af {\o}kologiske f{\o}devarer samt for at styrke hensyntagen til natur og milj{\o}, dyrevelf{\ae}rd samt de sociale betingelser 
i den {\o}kologiske produktion. Forskningsprogrammet F{\O}JO III har fra starten haft til hensigt at udf{\o}re forskning, der d{\ae}kker hele den {\o}kologiske v{\ae}rdik{\ae}de/f{\o}devarek{\ae}de ? fra produktionen i marken og stalden til forarbejdningen og til forbrugerne. Forskningen skal frembringe ny brugbar viden om det {\o}kologiske jordbrugs muligheder for at bidrage til en b{\ae}redygtig samfundsudvikling.
Forskningsprogrammet best{\r a}r af 15 projekter med et totalt budget p{\r a} ca. 170 millioner, som er finansieret af Ministeriet for F{\o}devarer, Landbrug og Fiskeri. De 15 projekters forskningsemner udm{\ae}rker sig ved at v{\ae}re b{\r a}de 
brede og samordnede, og de udnytter synergi mellem de fremmeste/bedste forskningsmilj{\o}er i Danmark.
F{\O}JO III-programmet er koordineret af Internationalt Center for Forskning i {\O}kologisk Jordbrug og F{\o}devaresystemer, ICROFS. Hvis du vil vide mere om forskningsarbejdet, er du velkommen til at bes{\o}ge www.icrofs.dk/danskforskning. 
Her kan du blandt andet f{\r a} direkte adgang til de cirka 400 rapporter, artikler og nyhedsbreve, som indtil videre er udgivet som f{\o}lge af F{\O}JO IIIprojekterne. },

In agriculture, entrepreneurship is particularly relevant because farmers need to find ways to adapt their businesses to the changing structural environment. This book describes entrepreneurship in terms of its learnable and teachable aspects, and elaborates the concept of entrepreneurial skill in farming. It constitutes the final report of the EU-funded research project Developing Entrepreneurial Skills of Farmers, summarising and synthesising the results. In addition to elaborating a consistent concept of entrepreneurial skills in farming, the project analysed the factors influencing the learning of such skills and produced recommendations on how to adapt the political, institutional and educational framework in order to foster their development. Furthermore, an e-learning tool for farmers, which includes a self-assessment of entrepreneurial skills, was developed in the project and is described in the book.},

This development indicates that farmers are taking the initiative and pursuing ways to develop their businesses. Obviously, this development implies the need for entrepreneurial skills.

In this study entrepreneurial skills are understood as the skills of recognizing and realizing business opportunities, networking and utilizing contacts, as well as creating and evaluating a business strategy. Are these skills relevant in the farm context? Do farmers consider these skills important?

How do they assess themselves regarding these skills? How do farmers explain the development of these skills? What could be done to enhance the development of these skills? 

This book?s aim is to answer these questions with the help of a detailed analysis of qualitative interviews with farmers in six European countries. The book reports the results from the main study of the EU-funded research project ?Developing Entrepreneurial Skills of Farmers` (ESoF).

Both organic and conventional farmers were intereviewed.

Marketing / Consumer behaviour
The difficult economic situation in Germany has strained the food industry, because consumers have become much more conscious of prices. Mainly discount stores have profited from this development and even registered rising turnovers. The result of this is that production prices came more and more under pressure. For many foods production costs could barely be covered or lost out to cheaper products from abroad.
An opposite trend can be seen in the organic sector: While retail stores in the food sector are having losses, the organic field is recording positive two-digit turnovers. Though there were different food scandals, these only had a short-term effect. More and more consumers are becoming aware of a healthy diet and nourishment. Surely, the Federal Scheme has contributed positively to this development.
The consumer backgrounds are rather losing transparency, as the organic niche has lost its organic ?alternative? image. Though there are still convinced organic activists, there are equally those, who are occasional buyers with different familial and educational backgrounds. Even the motives and reasons to buy organic have become diverse. Research projects dealing with the analysis of the qualitative structure of organic consumer behaviour (especially occasional and rare buyers of organic goods) have been realised on survey basis in the Federal Organic Farming Scheme. Furthermore, projects concerning the demand of organic food products have been conducted using panel data and long-term observations.
Another branch of market research deals with the successful marketing initiatives of organic products, as well as the effect in sales promotion and special price offers in retail.
An improvement is also necessary at the interface between producers of organic goods and commercial enterprises. Many consumers are prepared to buy organic products, but do not want to spend the time and effort to comb through the different stores in order to find what they want or need. Therefore, the need exists to bundle the portfolio of goods of the manufacturers and establish communication to retailers. Latter are only interested in clients that are affine to organic goods and want to keep such clients with respective marketing, so that these will buy from the retailer, who offers a large product palette. This sensitive topic was taken up by a broad project of the Federal Organic Farming Scheme, which is currently running.
At the beginning of the Federal Scheme, research projects focused on the primary sector, i.e. the production side. But sustainable agriculture can only develop, if the demand side equally rises. Thus, in 2003/2004, many projects turned towards the marketing issue. In the meantime, the organic niche has started to develop into a branch of its own. The increasing entry of retailers and also of discount stores into the sale of organic goods reflects this as well. Unfortunately, risks evolve next to the many positive opportunities, as conventional agriculture has already experienced since several years: The producing side gets more and more under pressure from the buyer side, because the demand for high quality, consistent and largely produced goods, can only be satisfied, if a constant delivery is warranted. This increases the pressure on rationalisation. Additionally, foreign producers of organic raw materials and goods are also pressing forward onto the German market, which does not facilitate the situation for the German organic farms and businesses.
Many stakeholders fear that German organic farmers will be forced to use conventional methods such as securing short-term harvest maximisation and placing the optimisation of the farm processes in the back. Advances in organic agriculture cannot be achieved if only single production techniques or branches are intensified or changed, without considering the interaction within the entire farming system.
A solution for this conflict of aims is difficult, because economic, political, social and scientific interests have to be aligned. This implies the following for organic research: Scientists, as well as those who decide about financing of research projects in Germany, have to do justice to the area of conflict between the pressure of conventionalising (i.e. organic farming, which is on the legal periphery) and the desired holistic approach for a sustainable and environmental-friendly agriculture.
The stakeholders of the organic food industry are equally challenged: They have not only to convince the consumer of the quality of produced goods, but also of the quality and raised environmental-friendliness of the production process.
This proves to be a difficult task. The occasional buyer?s motives to go for organic products are mostly of an egoistic nature. He/she decides on the basis of health, taste etc. Higher or altruistic motives are of secondary nature, such as honouring the ecological and social benefits of organic agriculture. These include protection of natural resources, conservation of biodiversity as well as securing and creating new jobs.
The Federal Scheme supports the difficult task to communicate the process quality as an added value. A model project supports a dairy farm by purposely raising the price of the produced milk by 5 cent/litre. Then, this surcharge is mentioned on the packaging as a direct income transfer for the milk producing farmers. This surcharge is given directly to the regional milk producers so that they are also able to produce cost effectively in the future. The practice was a success, as early fears of a loss in sales by 10-20 \% was unfounded. The project idea that a higher price helps to conserve the landscape and secure regional jobs even led to an introduction of new clients for the dairy. Furthermore, new stores took up this milk into their product range, which were then able to sell more milk than before. The sale of the organic milk with a surcharge did not go to the expense of organic milk sales of other dairies.
Basically, this example is transferable to other products as well and shows that even regional sales structures make it possible to use the processing quality of organic farming as a sales criterion.
In times of an increasing globalisation, process quality is not just a matter of environmental-friendly agriculture, but it receives an ethical dimension as well. Many consumers consider the moral reputation of a company. What kind of values does the company represent? Are job and family compatible for his employees? How does he deal with his suppliers? Does the company also take social responsibility with the respective obligation?
Markets do not necessarily orient themselves towards the lowest prices. The person as an entrepreneur, as an employee of a company, as well as a consumer, equally designs the market (un)consciously with his or her specific ethical orientation.
While the conventional sector has been trying to polish its image since several years with specific measures, the organic sector never had this problem. There never was a reputation deficit, as organic agriculture already started off with a highly ethical claim.
Nevertheless, the belief that the product speaks for itself is losing its validity in the increasing globalisation and anonymity. Still, especially the organic branch is very dependant on its social and ethical image. Hence, the implementation of a value management system would be a valuable asset. Within the Federal Organic Farming Scheme a feasibility study was elicited to check, whether there would be a possibility to introduce a certified ethical or value management system for the natural food sector. The aim is to get an active involvement of companies in this sector into the implementation of such an ethical management system. Such a management system can have an internal, as well as an external benefit for the companies: internally it will help the employee to identify him/herself with the employer and the orientation towards its values. Externally, this systematic management of values will help to communicate corporate citizenship, credibility and a moral reputation to the consumer. In the medium-term, the consumer is supposed to identify him/herself with the ethical values of the product connected to the producer, which the consumer will then take into consideration of his purchase decision.},

        abstract = {In order to guarantee a suitable income to the farmers and  respond to the consumers? demand, European Commission has proposed new guidelines for the cultivation of cereals. Such proposal strictly depends on: previous decisions of the Community which didn?t give the expected results; the  presence of new exporting countries on the international market; the variable cereal production of the last years. Being the new guidelines involving further economic sacrifices of the cereal farmers this project would become essential to recover a strong competitiveness on the international cereals' market.
The competitiveness of cereal sector can be increased by innovative high quality varieties  and the set up of suitable cultural techniques maximizing the germoplasm potential. In such a situation a predominant role can be played in Italy by the organic production of  cereals with a high technological, nutritional and health  quality, whose demand is also strongly increasing on the international market.
Thus, the general objective of the project is to increase the technical and scientific knowledge on common and durum wheat organic production and to transfer innovations to organic farmers through:
- the identification and/or the development of wheat varieties fitting the specific organic farming requirements, with technological characteristics more closed to the market and consumers? needs, in order both to improve cereal food quality and valorize the added value of typical and niche productions; 
- the set up/refining of cultural techniques with a low environment impact, looking at those  with the best impact on the technological and nutritional quality of the grains (manuring and biotic adversity control). Particular attention will be paid to the health aspect, monitoring the presence of toxic substances on the grains and their products in the critical points of the production chain;
- the definition of efficient methodologies for the traceability and the control of raw materials and their derived products.
 The expected results of  this project are the following:
1.availability of lists of recommended wheat varieties (commercial and/or local and old ecotypes) assuring satisfactory performances in organic farming.
2.Set up of organic cultural techniques and  systems, in the framework of EC regulation 2092/91,  able to maximize the productive and qualitative potentialities of the selected germoplasm. 
3.Models and protocols for organic production chains of certified cereal food (bread, pasta, cookies) exploiting the technological, nutritional and health quality of the selected wheat germoplasm, the raw materials and the derived products, including those typical of some Italian areas .
4.Availability of new rustic and competitive wheat germoplasm resistant to the main biotic and abiotic stress and with a high sink and source activity.
5.Advanced analytical methods (DNA-based) for the traceability (plant species, variety fingerprinting for authenticity assessment, GMO and pests detection, etc.) of the organic cereal production chains (seeds, grains, flours, food) and for the identification of their geographical origin.
The peculiarity and the added value of this project consists in the multidisciplinary approach (breeding, agro-techniques, pest and weed control, commercial and nutritional quality of food products, food safety) to the many scientific and technical problems of the organic cereals' production .
The overall objectives will be achieved through a number of work-packages, coordinated by WP leaders selected for their expertise in different area of the cereal and organic food and farming research and for their managerial capacity. The work-packages are the following:
- WP1 (UO1: leader Fabrizio Quaranta, CRA-ISC Rome); national network of organic field trials on common and durum wheat varieties; 
- WP2 (UO2: leader Marina Pasquini,CRA-ISC Rome); breeding and genetic improvement;
- WP3 (UO3: leader Maurizio Perenzin, CRA-ISC S. Angelo L.); organic farming systems
- WP4 (UO4: leader Orazio Li Destri, CRA-ISC Foggia); crop protection and weed management;
- WP5 (UO5: leader Giuseppina Avantaggiato, CNR, Bari); monitoring of toxic substances through the organic cereal production chain;
- WP6 (UO6: leader Valeria Terzi, CRA-ISC Fiorenzuola d'Arda); traceability in the organic cereal production chain 
- WP7 (UO7: leader Ester De Stefanis, CRA-ISC Rome); technological quality of organic wheat products
- WP8 (UO8: leader Fiorella Sinesio, INRAN Rome); nutritional and health quality of organic  wheat products.
The project makes also use of the external collaboration of the following research groups and associations:
AIAB- Associazione italiana agricoltura biologica (Organic farming Italian association;
Regioni: Piemonte, Lombardia, Veneto, Friuli, Emilia R., Toscana, Abruzzo, Sicilia (Experimentation centres of  regional governments);

The aim of the project is to reduce pest damage and pesticide use by increasing on farm functional (agro)-biodiversity (FAB). The two main expected outcomes of ECOORCHARD are to a) identify common assessment methods and compare these to new approaches to increase FAB and b) recommend a method suitable for monitoring FAB on farms and in scientific trials.  Methods will be developed in close collaboration with growers, which will increase successful on-farm implementation. The project investigations will take place in nine different countries in Europe and the outcome will be relevant for growers in the whole EU region}

Collective Farmers Marketing Initiatives (COFAMIs) potentially provide an answer to the challenges set to European farmers by changing market and policy conditions. By pooling ideas, experiences and capital they enable farmers to build up market knowledge and linkages, and create a favourable environment for the dissemination of skills and best practices. Also, concentration of offer may open up scale advantages, strengthen the collective bargaining power of producers, and make them attractive market partners for retailers operating at larger scales. More generally, COFAMIs have the potential to reinforce rural incomes and employment, strengthen synergies with other economic activities, and bring agriculture more in line with the demands set by wider society.
Project aims including target group:
This project aims to strengthen the role of COFAMIs by identifying the social, economic, cultural and political factors that limit/enable their development. Additionally, it seeks to formulate viable support strategies to enhance their performance, dissemination and continuity. By means of national status-quo analyses and a set of in-depth case studies it addresses the existing diversity of COFAMIs in Europe to determine the relative influence of different types of limiting/enabling factors. 
The overall objective of the project is:
To identify the social, economic, cultural and political factors that are limiting/enabling farmers to pool ideas, experiences and capital in the development of co-operative producer organisations and marketing initiatives that adequately respond to changing market and policy conditions. In addition to the identification of barriers, limitations and success factors, the project seeks to identify viable strategies and appropriate support measures for enhancing the performance, dissemination and continuity of collective marketing initiatives. 
Methodology:
-	Qualitative case-study analysis
-	Action research design
-	Expert consultation

        abstract = {A long-term farming systems comparison study was initiated at Bioforsk Arable Crops Division, Apelsvoll, in 1989. The aim was to compare on a model farm level differences in yields, nutrient runoff, nutrient balances and economical results for conventional, integrated and organic dairy and cash crop farming systems. The vision of the project was to develop farming systems that minimized the runoff of nutrients and pesticide residues, produced healthy crops with optimal nutritional value, and gave satisfying yields and economic results.  In 2000, the system was changed so that the term ?integrated? was replaced by ?optimal?, defined as the treatment that achieves the maximum yield per kilo leached nitrogen. The study comprises a field lysimeter with 12 plots, each 0.18 ha. Each plot is treated as a model farm, and six different farming systems (2 replicates per system) are compared as follows: 
1.	A reference cash crop farm with cereals and potatoes, managed as in the reference year of 1985
2.	Optimal cash crop
3.	Organic cash crop with 25\% land as green manure
4.	Optimal cash crop with animal manure  and 50\% ley
5.	Organic mixed crop with 50\% ley 
6.	Organic mixed crop with 75\% ley

All model farms are managed with a 4-year crop rotation, where all crops are grown in each year (all plots are divided in four sub-plots). Please contact audun.korsaeth@bioforsk.no for further information and publications from the study.}

In most existing farm networks the choice of participating farms rests upon pragmatic criteria, such as the willingness of farmers to cooperate. The representativeness of the farm (farm type) is often not taken into account. However, for socio-economic and interdisciplinary research subjects the farm type often matters. Furthermore, existing farm networks are mostly targeted to either collecting economic data or participatory research in technical questions. Participatory economic research, though, is rare.
The data base for economic data in organic farming is fragmentary. Improving this data base will support farmers in their strategic decisions, extension and research in their work and will help farmers? associations to develop their policy.
Definition of the problem:
Lack of basic socio-economic data in organic farming, e.g. incomes.
Farmers are insufficiently involved in socio-economic research.

To enhance a regularly updated economic data base for organic farming.
To foster socio-economic on farm research.
To improve cooperation of farmers, extension and research in socio-economic questions.

             url = {https://orgprints.org/id/eprint/28568/},
        abstract = {Sale of organic foods is one of the fastest growing market segments within the global food industry. However, the number of processed foods made from organic raw materials is still limited. Furthermore, the EU regulatory framework for organic food defines high quality of the products as an important goal of production but evaluation of processing technologies according to the requirements of organic food production is in general lacking. Consumers buy organic food because they believe in the high quality of the product. The most important reasons are health benefits (less pesticide residues and better nutritional quality), taste, and environmentally friendly production. Since organic production in EU competes with both conventional food and global organic production it depends greatly on innovation, novel appropriate technologies and scientific evidence to support the quality. To increase the amount of products commercially available that meet the requirements of organic food production and consumer expectations more research and knowledge is needed focusing on development and adaptation of processing technologies. The focus will be on innovating along the processing chain of organic fresh berries and value added products obtained using organic berries as raw materials but the findings of the project can be extrapolated to other organic plant products.
The general objective of the project is to identify processing solutions to enhance the safety and overall quality and nutritional value of organic processed berries by adapting traditional processing methods to organic requirements, further developing methods that are not fully implemented and developing new sustainable processing schemes. Technologies to naturally extend the shelf-life of fresh berries and to process berries into added value products will also be considered. The technologies and processing schemes will be adapted to organic products and selected based on their environmental impact. 
The results will be widely disseminated and transferred to relevant stakeholders and in scientific journals, at international conferences and workshops. The main stakeholders for this project are (i) distributers of fresh berries (ii) food producers that use berries as raw material e.g. juice-, yogurt-, and smoothies manufacturers (iii) food producers that use dried fruits in their products (breakfast cereals, yoghurt, ice cream); (iv) entrepreneurs interested in food innovations, (v) retailers (vi) consumer organisations.

Ziel des INTEGRA-Projektes ist die Entwicklung eines frei verf{\"u}gbaren Softwaretools zur r{\"a}umlichen Planung der Habitateigenschaften von Agrarsystemen auf wissenschaftlicher Grundlage. Das Softwaretool integriert erstmals vorhandenes Wissen und im Projekt neu erarbeitetes Wissen zur Einbringung von B{\"a}umen, Str{\"a}uchern und Bl{\"u}hpflanzen in die Agrarlandschaft, um ein ganzj{\"a}hriges diverses Nahrungsangebot f{\"u}r typische Best{\"a}uberinsekten (Honigbiene, Wildbienen, Hummeln, Schwebfliegen und Schmetterlinge) sicherzustellen sowie das Nistplatzangebot zu optimieren. In dem intuitiv bedienbaren Tool kann der Praktiker nun B{\"a}ume, B{\"u}sche und Bl{\"u}hstreifen r{\"a}umlich anordnen und den Effekt auf die Best{\"a}uberinsekten hinsichtlich der Habitateignung seiner Fl{\"a}chen quantifizieren. Die Reichweiten der Best{\"a}ubungsleistung der Insekten werden dabei r{\"a}umlich modelliert, ebenso das Wachstum und das Bl{\"u}tenangebot von B{\"a}umen und B{\"u}schen im Jahresverlauf und {\"u}ber die Jahre hinweg. Zus{\"a}tzlich werden Nebeneffekte und Interaktionen zwischen B{\"a}umen und B{\"u}schen und den landwirtschaftlichen Feldfr{\"u}chten wie Beschattung, Wurzelkonkurrenz sowie Kohlenstoffspeicherung mit {\"o}kophysiologischen Modellen berechnet, um eine optimierte Anordnung zu erreichen. Im Projekt ist ein intensiver Wissensaustausch mit Praktikern vorgesehen sowie eine rechtliche Einordnung der Ma{\ss}nahmen, so dass der Planer im Tool bereits die rechtlichen Rahmenvorschriften und eventuellen F{\"o}rderma{\ss}nahmen w{\"a}hrend des Planungsvorganges abrufen kann. Durch das INTEGRA-Planungstool wird dem Landwirt erstmals ein leistungsf{\"a}higes Werkzeug zur r{\"a}umlichen Planung der {\"o}kologischen Intensivierung an die Hand gegeben, das durch offene Schnittstellen sofort in Big-Data Applikationen zur Landwirtschaft 4.0 eingebunden werden kann.

F{\"u}r den Vergleich von drei genetischen Bullenherk{\"u}nften (HF aus Deutschland, HF aus Neuseeland, Jerseys aus Neuseeland) wurden deutschlandweit 50 Betriebe ausgew{\"a}hlt, die eine intensive Weidewirtschaft praktizieren.

This project explores the potential for developing new rice based cropping system integrated with novel strategies to mitigate GHG emissions. There are a number of aquatic plant species, which exists naturally in rice producing regions and are already part of human consumption in local cultures. We plan to test these plant species for their potential to reduce emissions of methane and nitrous oxide while grown together with rice.

OSCAR involves 20 Partners from 9 European countries, Morocco, Brazil as well as the international research centre ICARDA. The research programme starts in April 2012 and ends in 2016.
The project aims to develop improved conservation tillage systems, based on subsidiary crops (also known as cover crops), used both as living and dead mulch, that 
increase the duration of soil coverage by plant canopies;
minimize the need for soil tillage and redce tillage intensity; increase the diversity of species within the plant canopy and the rotation; reduce the need for fertilisers, pesticides and herbicides; and 
in dry climates, conserve water and reduce need for irrigation.

OSCAR studies the key factors that influence the success of cover cropping systems, including cultivation methods, machinery and suitable plant genotypes. The research aims to develop targeted systems for the varied economic and ecological conditions in Europe and in the non-European participating countries. OSCAR assesses the ecological and economic impacts of the new cropping systems in both organic and conventional agriculture.
The core of the experimental programme is a set of coordinated field trials in 12 different environments, ranging from boreal climates in North Europe to Mediterranean and tropical subhumid climates.
The main output of the project will be a comprehensive, publically available knowledge base (Cover Crop and Living Mulch Toolbox), which will contain many user interactive elements and will be further developed after termination of the project.}

This program is characterized by 3 points:
?	a research in partnership for the research questions conception and their valorization,
?	complex research objects which need an interdisciplinary work,
?	A program opened to other research organisms and universities.

This program concerned 3 thematics:
?	Thematic 1: Regional development and agricultural production process
?	Thematic 2: Regional approach of the environment and management of the rural areas
?	Thematic 3: Products, firms, food industry, dies and territories
?	Thematic 4: Public policies, actor networks, territorial and regional dynamics.

Only a small part of this program concerns organic farming. This part  corresponds to the thematic 3, and concerns food systems.

        abstract = {There is a great potential to ameliorate young stock rearing systems concerning animal welfare-friendly husbandry, feeding and disease prevention. This project aims to identify approaches on different levels: Surveys on dairy calf rearing systems with cow-calf contact practised in several European countries will provide information on distribution, diversity and success of such systems, and on barriers or support due to national standards. Economic modelling will show their impacts on gross-margins. On-farm trials with 2-3 selected systems will evaluate their impact on animal welfare including health, production, economic and work load parameters compared to common systems. Veal fattening with foster cows will be compared to common automatic feeders on 3 commercial farms. On 5 organic farms effects of feeding increased milk levels on welfare, behaviour, and performance of replacement calves will be analysed in comparison to common feeding. It will be investigated whether the content of immunoglobulins in colostrum and milk can be stimulated via cow-calf contact or via feed supplements. To study long-term effects of young stock rearing methods on health and performance later in life, different feeding (silage vs. non-silage) and grazing strategies (extensive vs. intensive) will be studied. The impact of plant bioactive compounds on protein use efficiency, animals? immune response, and product quality will be assessed. A result of this project will be recommendations on the implementation of animal friendly and efficient dairy calf rearing and fattening systems in which use of antibiotics and anthelmintics is minimised. Details on novel rearing systems and their impacts will be known and published in peer reviewed journals and on scientific conferences. Best practice sharing will be promoted via workshops, leaflets and websites for farmers and advisors. This will help to solve welfare problems in current calf rearing.},

        abstract = {Ekologiskt lantbruk utvecklas konkret genom att {\"o}ka kunskapen om till{\"a}mpad ekologisk teknik, t ex hur man kan utveckla ett samspel mellan djurh{\r a}llning och v{\"a}xtodling med syftet att minska p{\r a} punktbelastningar och beroendet av externa resurser. Den tanken stod som modell f{\"o}r v{\r a}rt f{\"o}rs{\"o}k med v{\"a}rph{\"o}ns i mobila hus och som hade sin utevistelse i olika gr{\"o}dor, n{\"a}mligen raps, solrosor, v{\r a}rvete och h{\"o}stvete. Utevistelse f{\"o}r h{\"o}ns i permanenta rastg{\r a}rdar kan medf{\"o}ra {\"o}verskott av v{\"a}xtn{\"a}ring till marken och problem med parasiter och foth{\"a}lsa f{\"o}r h{\"o}nsen. F{\"o}r att minska dessa problem {\"a}r det v{\"a}sentligt att h{\"o}nsen sprider sig v{\"a}l utomhus. Reglerna f{\"o}reskriver att marken ska kunna h{\r a}llas v{\"a}l bevuxen, varf{\"o}r h{\"o}ns oftast erbjuds utevistelse p{\r a} en etablerad vall som har en stark v{\"a}xtsv{\r a}l. Man har dock visat att kycklingar och h{\"o}ns f{\"o}redrar ytor med tr{\"a}d framf{\"o}r kort gr{\"a}s och att de undviker starkt solljus. Ett annat s{\"a}tt att {\"o}ka den nyttjade markarealen till f{\"o}rdel f{\"o}r v{\"a}xtn{\"a}ringssituationen och troligen ocks{\r a} f{\"o}r parasitbelastningen, {\"a}r att ha mobil h{\"o}nsh{\r a}llning d{\"a}r h{\"o}nsen flyttas runt inom och mellan f{\"a}lt i v{\"a}xtf{\"o}ljden. Om man vill integrera h{\"o}nsen i v{\"a}xtodlingen men har station{\"a}ra h{\"o}nshus b{\"o}r m{\"o}jligheten att ocks{\r a} odla v{\"a}xtf{\"o}ljdens gr{\"o}dor p{\r a} den mark d{\"a}r h{\"o}nsen ska ha sin utevistelse unders{\"o}kas. Spannm{\r a}l {\"a}r den vanligaste gr{\"o}dan, som dessutom utg{\"o}r den huvuddelen av h{\"o}nsens f{\"o}da. Ekologiskt odlad rapsolja och solrosolja {\"a}r efterfr{\r a}gade p{\r a} marknaden. Restprodukten rapskaka och solroskaka utg{\"o}r ett koncentrerat energi och proteintillskott till digivande suggor och h{\"o}gproducerande h{\"o}ns. Solros och raps {\"a}r gr{\"o}dor som vanligen kr{\"a}ver ogr{\"a}sreglering. I ekologisk produktion ers{\"a}tts ofta kemisk bek{\"a}mpning med extra k{\"o}rningar f{\"o}r mekanisk bek{\"a}mpning eller av flamning, metoder som man egentligen vill minimera. Ovanst{\r a}ende resonemang ledde fram till att vi sommaren 2003 genomf{\"o}rde ett f{\"o}rs{\"o}k med v{\"a}rph{\"o}ns i mobila vagnar med raps och solros som gr{\"o}dor. Sommaren 2004 upprepades f{\"o}rs{\"o}ket med raps, h{\"o}stvete och v{\r a}rvete som gr{\"o}dor. Hypoteserna var att h{\"o}nsen har en ogr{\"a}sreglerande effekt i gr{\"o}dor med stort radavst{\r a}nd, att h{\"o}nsen uppfattar en gr{\"o}da som {\"a}r h{\"o}gre {\"a}n de sj{\"a}lva som ett skydd, att h{\"o}nsen bidrar med eng{\"o}dslingseffekt till gr{\"o}dan, att gr{\"o}da och ogr{\"a}s kan utg{\"o}ra en del av h{\"o}nsens foderintag, att den sammanlagda effekten blir en vinst n{\"a}r det g{\"a}ller markbehov f6;r h{\"o}nsens utevistelse j{\"a}mf{\"o}rt med att ha en s{\"a}rskild rastg{\r a}rd.  F{\"o}rs{\"o}ken p{\r a}gick 25/6 ? 9/9 2003 och 22/6 ? 16/9 2004 p{\r a} Ekhaga f{\"o}rs{\"o}ksg{\r a}rd tillh{\"o}rande Sveriges Lantbruksuniversitet. I mitten av maj 2003 s{\r a}ddes fyra f{\"o}rs{\"o}ksytor och en kontrollyta med v{\r a}rraps och likadant med solros av en l{\r a}gv{\"a}xande sort. Varje f{\"o}rs{\"o}ksyta var 200 m2. Tv{\r a} flockar med 50 h{\"o}ns av Lohman Selected Leghorn (LSL) inhystes i varsin mobil h{\"o}nsvagn med foder, sittpinnar och reden. Vagnarna hade {\"o}ppet golv, s{\r a} g{\"o}dseln f{\"o}ll direkt p{\r a} marken. H{\"o}norna hade fri tillg{\r a}ng p{\r a} helt vete, hel havre, sn{\"a}ckskal samt en blandning av fiskmj{\"o}l, kalk, vitaminer och mineraler i separata foderautomater. Dricksvattnet serverades i baljor under eller vid vagnarna H{\"o}nsen hade m{\"o}jlighet att g{\r a} ut och in dygnet runt. Vagnarna och h{\"o}nsen var 3 veckor i varje f{\"o}rs{\"o}ksruta, f{\"o}rst 2*3 veckor i raps sedan 2*3 veckor i solros. {\r A}r 2004 var f{\"o}rs{\"o}ksrutorna st{\"o}rre, 1100-2000 m2 och gr{\"o}dorna var raps, v{\r a}rvete och h{\"o}stvete. Vi hade tre vagnar med 45 h{\"o}ns i varje, samma hybrid och {\r a}lder som {\r a}ret innan, och med samma utfodring. Vagnarna bytte gr{\"o}da varje vecka, och p{\r a} s{\r a} s{\"a}tt hade alla vagnar varit p{\r a} alla gr{\"o}dor fyra g{\r a}nger n{\"a}r f{\"o}rs{\"o}ket var slut. Vid varje flytt fick vagnen en ny plats. F{\"o}r att testa v{\r a}ra hypoteser gjorde vi f{\"o}ljande: 
- Beteendestudier: hur l{\r a}ngt sprider sig h{\"o}nsen fr{\r a}n vagnen? 
- H{\"o}nsens p{\r a}verkan p{\r a} ogr{\"a}s och gr{\"o}dor: Hur utvecklas ogr{\"a}s och gr{\"o}da n{\"a}r h{\"o}nsen finns i gr{\"o}dan j{\"a}mf{\"o}rt med en kontroll utan h{\"o}ns?
- Gr{\"o}dans inverkan p{\r a} h{\"o}nsens beteende: Har gr{\"o}dans h{\"o}jd n{\r a}gon betydelse f{\"o}r om h{\"o}nsen g{\r a}r ut och hur de sprider sig? 
- H{\"o}nsens konsumtion, produktion och h{\"a}lsa: {\"A}r det troligt att h{\"o}nsen f{\r a}r ett n{\"a}ringstillskott av gr{\"o}dan och hur p{\r a}verkas deras produktion och h{\"a}lsa? Gr{\"o}dans produktion: p{\r a}verkar h{\"o}nsen gr{\"o}dans produktion? 
- V{\"a}xtn{\"a}ringsbalanser: {\"A}r ett mobilt system mer f{\"o}rdelaktigt ur v{\"a}xtn{\"a}ringssynpunkt {\"a}n ett station{\"a}rt? 

Systemet som helhet har gett h{\"o}nsen skugga. H{\"o}nsen har betat gr{\"o}na v{\"a}xter i den omfattning som andra studier redovisar f{\"o}r h{\"o}gproducerande h{\"o}ns, och varit ute i gr{\"o}dan under motsvarande tid. N{\"a}r n{\"a}ringstillg{\r a}ngen {\"o}kade ute, {\"o}kade {\"a}ven vistelsetiden ute. En rej{\"a}l ogr{\"a}sreglerande effekt erh{\"o}lls i raps och solros genom betning n{\"a}r ogr{\"a}set tillv{\"a}xte som mest och genom mekanisk p{\r a}verkan n{\"a}r ogr{\"a}set var i fr{\"o}. Spridningen av g{\"o}dseln efter h{\"o}nsen blev alltf{\"o}r oj{\"a}mn. Med {\"o}ppen botten i vagnen m{\r a}ste den flyttas oftare, men h{\"o}nsen slipper n{\"a}stan helt att ha g{\"o}dsel i huset och sk{\"o}taren slipper att g{\"o}dsla ut. Arbetet med utg{\"o}dsling ers{\"a}tts med arbetet att flytta husen regelbundet. Rapsen och vetet gav s{\r a}v{\"a}l sk{\"o}rdad gr{\"o}da, t ex f{\"o}r h{\"o}nsens vinterbehov, som uteyta till h{\"o}nsen. H{\"o}nsen {\r a}t minst 20 \% mindre foder {\"a}n f{\"o}rv{\"a}ntat, foder som inte beh{\"o}vde sk{\"o}rdas, lagras och k{\"o}ras fram. En resursbesparing. H{\"o}nsens fj{\"a}derdr{\"a}kt h{\"o}ll sig utm{\"a}rkt, men foth{\"a}lsan b{\"o}r f{\"o}rb{\"a}ttras. 

Slutsats om markbehov f{\"o}r utevistelsen: I station{\"a}ra system finns inget behov av speciell mark f{\"o}r utevistelsen eftersom h{\"o}nsen kan nyttja vanliga jordbruksgr{\"o}dor. I mobila system med {\"o}ppna golv och n{\"a}r vagnen flyttas ofta f{\"o}r att f{\r a} en god spridning av g{\"o}dseln f{\r a}r man kanske r{\"a}kna med att ca 10m2 per h{\"o}na inte kan sk{\"o}rdas. Vi unders{\"o}kte in f{\"o}rekomsten av in{\"a}lvsparasiter och kan d{\"a}rmed inte visa i vilka ytor och rutiner som kan vara n{\"o}dv{\"a}ndiga f{\"o}r att h{\r a}lla h{\"o}nsen vid god h{\"a}lsa n{\"a}r det g{\"a}ller dessa.},

        keywords = {Agro-ecological Service Crops, ecological services, roller crimping, soil quality, soil fertility, organic vegetable production},
        abstract = {Agro-ecological Service Crops (ASC) are introduced in the agro-ecosystems to provide or enhance ecological services, thus promoting the whole soil-plant system equilibrium. ASC introduction and proper management have impact on soil quality and fertility and soil nutrients losses. They also contribute to increase soil C sink potential, to mitigate GHG emissions and influence weeds, diseases and pests occurrence. To avoid competition with the subsequent cash crops, the growth of the interposed ASC is terminated in advance of the cash crop planting. The traditional, most widespread, technique used to terminate the ASC is incorporation as green manure into the soil by tillage. However, since tillage is an energy and labour consuming and soil disturbing operation, the use of no/reduced tillage techniques, as the rolling crimping technology that terminates by flattening the ASC, has received increasing interest. This research project aims at verifying the hypothesis that the use of the roller crimping technology for ASC termination will i) maintain yield of the cash crops and vegetable products quality, ii) reduce soil disturbance and enhance soil quality, improving internal system use of nutritive elements, iii) reduce fossil fuel energy consumption, iv) create a suppressive environment for pests, diseases and weeds. The project will also test the hypothesis that, compared with the incorporation of ASC into the soil as green manure, the use of the roller crimper reduces nutrient losses from the soil/plant system and GHG soil emission. The project also wants to verify if the introduction and the proper management of warm season ASC in the milder climatic areas (i.e. Southern Europe regions) could be a feasible option for resilient vegetable cropping system design and management. The main expected result is the optimisation and the spreading of novel ASC management strategies aimed to improve soil quality and to enhance resources use in organically managed systems for vegetable production. The Soilveg project will be organized in 7 work packages and it will last 36 months with the involvement of 14 partners from 9 different Core Organic Plus countries.}

        abstract = {The aim of the present research is to analyse how organic farms could specialise and cultivate with appropriate efficiency without having to compromise the diversity necessary for organic farming. The obstacles for organic farm co-operation will be charted and the aim is to find viable solutions to the problems. The aim is also to influence political decision-making so that the threshold for co-operation could be lowered. 

In Finland, the share of organic production of the total agricultural land is currently 7\%. The demand for organic products exceeds supply. Diversity decreases the profitability of the farm: In organic production, specialisation has been feasible only up to a certain point. Appropriate crop rotation means, in practice, that in addition to the main production line, the farm engages in supplementary production. However, diversified production inevitably leads to small-scale production. The amount of work increases the equipment and labour costs per parcel. Co-operation can bring even larger benefits in organic production than in conventional production. Genuine savings in workload are generated. On animal and cereal farms it would allow both farmers to specialise in their respective lines while safeguarding a sufficient nutrient rotation. This would be highly sensible also in terms of environmental impact. 

The research will comprise both a written section and two different farm-level studies. Literature and experts will be consulted in order to chart the technical and legislative obstacles, as well as those posed by subsidy policies for a comprehensive co-operation between farms. On the farm-level section, the project will be familiarised with two or three partnerships engaged in comprehensive co-operation. The research project will involve two to five farms for study purposes (project farms). These farms have recently launched co-operation or are planning to do so. The project will draw up a co-operation model jointly with the farms. The functioning of the model will be monitored throughout the research period. 

The progress of the project will be presented in media. The final report will be published in the form of a guide directed at advisory personnel and farms. The research will produce practical and immediately applicable data on the opportunities to expand co-operation between organic and conventional farms, as well as in the activities of the relevant authorities.}

        abstract = {1. Vorhabenziel
Die Ausweitung der {\"o}kologisch bewirtschafteten Fl{\"a}che setzt voraus, dass die Betriebe die auf {\"o}kologischen Landbau umstellen oder ihre bereits {\"o}kologisch bewirtschaftete Fl{\"a}che ausdehnen wollen, auch die notwendigen Fl{\"a}chen erhalten. Eine in den letzten Jahren abnehmende Wachstumsrate der {\"o}kologisch bewirtschafteten Fl{\"a}che wirft die Frage auf, ob dies unter Umst{\"a}nden mit der Funktionsweise der landwirtschaftlichen Boden- und Pachtm{\"a}rkte in Verbindung stehen k{\"o}nnte. Anhand einer eingehenden Analyse des landwirtschaftlichen Pachtmarktes soll untersucht werden, ob hemmende und/oder f{\"o}rdernde Faktoren identifiziert und zur Ausweitung des {\"O}kolandbaus positiv beeinflusst werden k{\"o}nnen. 
2. Arbeitsplanung
In den bisherigen Untersuchungen zum {\"o}kologischen Landbau waren zwar auch schon Erfolgsfaktoren von Umstellung und Ausweitung analysiert worden, jedoch ohne den Pachtmarkt selber in den Fokus zu r{\"u}cken. Dazu werden auf Ebene der Landkreise Untersuchungsregionen ausgew{\"a}hlt, die sich hinsichtlich der Konkurrenz am Pachtmarkt und des Anteils der {\"o}kologisch bewirtschafteten Fl{\"a}che deutlich voneinander unterscheiden. In diesen Regionen werden Bewirtschafter von unterschiedlichen {\"o}kologischen Betriebsformen und Bodeneigent{\"u}mer als Verp{\"a}chter ausfindig gemacht und zu den m{\"o}glichen Bestimmungsgr{\"u}nden der Verpachtung befragt. Es wird eine Kombination von quantitativen und qualitativen Analysemethoden benutzt, um auch subjektive Motive identifizieren zu k{\"o}nnen.
3.Geplante Ergebnisverwertung
Die Untersuchung benutzt repr{\"a}sentative Untersuchungsregionen und repr{\"a}sentative Betriebsformen des {\"o}kologischen Landbaus und wendet sich damit an einen relativ gro{\ss}en Kreis landwirtschaftlicher Akteure. Da auch f{\"u}r die bisher so gut wie gar nicht untersuchte Stakeholdergruppe der Verp{\"a}chter eine Typisierung angestrebt wird, erheben die Ergebnisse auch in dieser Hinsicht den Anspruch auf Verallgemeinerbarkeit. Die Befragung bezieht nicht nur die bisherige Entwicklung der Konkurrenzsituation an den ausgew{\"a}hlten Pachtm{\"a}rkten ein sondern auch zuk{\"u}nftig neue Konstellationen, die sich durch Ver{\"a}nderungen der wirtschaftlichen und poltischen Rahmenbedingungen ergeben k{\"o}nnen. Sie sind deshalb auch f{\"u}r politische Akteure von Interesse. Neben den f{\"u}r wissenschaftliche Arbeiten {\"u}blichen Publikationswegen soll deshalb der zu den aktiven Teilnehmern der Befragungen aufgebaute Kontakt genutzt werden, um online eine erste Validierung der aus den Ergebnissen abgeleiteten Vorschl{\"a}ge zur Verbesserung der Wettbewerbsstellung der {\"O}kobetriebe am Pachtmarkt zu erreichen.

Fra 1991 til 2005 har {\o}kologisk jordbruksareal {\o}kt fra 24 430 til 430 330 daa, og utgj{\o}r n{\r a} 3,5\% av det samlede jordbruksarealet. Bare for {\r a} n{\r a} 10\%-m{\r a}let er det behov for at minst 4000 flere b{\o}nder legger om til {\o}kologisk landbruk, og enda flere m{\r a} legge om for {\r a} n{\r a} 15\%-m{\r a}let. Siden 2002 har omlag 200 b{\o}nder sluttet med Debio-godkjent {\o}kologisk produksjon hvert {\r a}r. Vi vet ikke om disse har vendt tilbake til konvensjonell drift, om de har avviklet gardsdrifta, eller om de fortsatt driver tiln{\ae}rmet {\o}kologisk, men {\o}nsker {\r a} st{\r a} utenfor Debio-ordningen.

Dette prosjektet vil unders{\o}ke hvorfor b{\o}ndene har sluttet med {\o}kologisk produksjon. Kunnskap om dette emnet er viktig for {\r a} kunne utarbeide landbrukspolitiske virkemidler og andre tiltak som kan sikre fortsatt vekst i {\o}kologisk matproduksjon i Norge.

Norske resultater og rammebetingelser vil bli sammenliknet med utenlandske. Vi vil ogs{\r a} diskutere virkemidler og tiltak for {\r a} avgrense frafallet fra {\o}kologisk gardsdrift. 

F{\o}rst vil vi sende ut et sp{\o}rreskjema til alle brukerne som har sluttet med {\o}kologisk drift i 2003 eller senere. Sp{\o}rreunders{\o}kelsen vil behandles med statistiske analyser. Deretter vil vi gjennomf{\o}re personlige dybdeintervju med noen av de tidligere {\o}ko-b{\o}ndene samt med andre viktige meningsberettigede. Disse intervjuene vil gi ytterligere innsikt og utfylle sp{\o}rreunders{\o}kelsen. Den valgte kombinasjonen av metoder vil gj{\o}re at vi f{\r a}r bedre forst{\r a}else av {\r a}rsakene til at gardbrukere slutter med {\o}kologisk drift.

Det er et samarbeid mellom Bioforsk {\O}kologisk, Tingvoll og Norsk institutt for landbruks{\o}konomisk forskning (NILF). Vi vil ha et internasjonalt samarbeid med Danmarks tekniske universitet og BOKU, universitet for naturressurser og anvendt naturvitenskap i Wien, {\O}sterrike.

        abstract = {This paper analyzes the links and overlappings between traditional knowledge and biodiversity in the context of ecological family farming in southern Brazil. The data presented are part of an ethnographic study carried out among a network of ecological farmers, Ecovida, in the west of Santa Catarina state. The current global patent regime, most prominently the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), has had direct effects on seed production and agricultural food crops. In a scenario of increasing creation of patents, patent regulations, provisions on cultivars (plant varieties and seed breeding) and a number of other global trade control mechanisms, family farmers and other related social actors have rejected the multilateral development agencies' notion of life as "resource". This study has a two-fold aim: first, it approaches the international context of the intellectual property regime on biodiversity and knowledge production; second, it examines the actions taken by farmers participating in the Ecovida network toward creating alternative ways of managing knowledge to produce "free" seeds. As an outcome, there is a parallel political action of criticism and resistance to the current narrowing of agriculture's genetic base, and organized efforts to multiply seeds, know-how and knowledge through networks, banks and centers of agro-biodiversity. Our central argument is that all these social actors - who make up the so-called ecological network and who seek, in their activities, to carry on the multiplication and variability of seeds and promote the diversity of knowledge to produce diverse seeds - are also creating collective strategies of social resistance vis-{\`a}-vis the prevailing global modes of controlling knowledge, seeds and food production.},

However, the methodological skills and prerequisites for successful living labs are not particularly well articulated. Based on our experience (five national and EU research projects) and our research backgrounds in (interdisciplinary) social science and participatory research, we highlight several risks associated with the use of living labs in agrifood studies without having the resources, reflectivity or skills required. These risks include: 1) imposing predefined agendas that are masked as participatory processes, 2) placing an overemphasis on confidentiality or knowledge sharing, and 3) getting lost in researcher roles. We argue that there is a need to discuss and improve understanding of these risks in order to produce successful living labs in agrifood studies, as well as avoid conceptual dilution or confusion.},

        abstract = {Transitioning towards more sustainable food products, such as plant proteins, requires a
change in practice by several actors in the agrifood system. Change of this kind involves everyday
choices about what food to produce, sell, prepare, and eat. Inspired by science and technology
studies (STS) thinking, we investigate how such choices are influenced by socio-material practices of
valuing. We use the case of fresh grain legumes for human consumption to explore how valuing is
simultaneously affected by and shapes the agrifood system. Through interviews with 24 actors in
the Danish agrifood system, we identify valuing parameters ranging from taste, nitrogen fixation,
durability, and nutrition to price. The study reveals differences regarding what and how actors value
depending on the actors? position in the agrifood system and how the fresh grain legumes travel
from field to plate. Where values conflict, we observe how some valuing practices have the power
to exclude others and thereby prevent specific enactments of the fresh grain legumes. We argue
that looking for valuing practices can help us understand how agrifood systems come into being,
and that valuing differently can represent active involvement, both academically and practically, in
encouraging change in the agrifood system. By using STS-thinking, the study brings novel insights
about barriers towards more plant-based diets and contributes to the diversification of theoretical
perspectives on sustainable transitions.},

These trials compare conventional (Conv) and organic (Org) farming systems at high and low input levels at two locations, i.e. Chuka, with Humic Nitisols, high inherent soil fertility and rainfall, and Thika, with Rhodic Nitisols with low soil fertility and rainfall. The high input systems (High) represent commercial-scale, export-oriented production that uses the recommended amounts of fertilisers, pesticides and irrigation water to generate high yields, whilst the low input systems (Low) represent local smallholder practices, using relatively few fertilisers and pesticides and operating under rain-fed conditions. The conventional systems received synthetic fertilisers and organic manure, whilst the organic systems only received organic inputs. The trials so far have consisted of a 6-season, 3-year, crop rotation with maize (Zea mays L.) planted in the long rainy seasons (March-September), and vegetables in the short rainy seasons (October ? February). Generally, there were no significant differences in the dry matter yields and nutrient uptake by maize, baby corn or beans between the conventional and organic systems at either site. Similar maize grain and baby corn yields were also obtained at Chuka. However, at Thika, maize grain yields in Org-High in 2007 (at conversion) were lower than the yields in Conv High, but the yields became similar in 2010 (after conversion). At the same site the yields of maize grain under sole cropping in Org-Low were 3.2 times lower than the yields in Conv-Low in 2007 and 1.7 times lower in 2010. When intercropped with beans the yields of the two systems were similar. In the first two years profits from Conv-High were 0.5?1.8 times and 0.2?2.4 times higher than in Org-High when selling the produce at local (Chuka and Thika) and regional markets (Nairobi), but thereafter the profit from the two was similar, even when organic produce was sold at regular market prices. From the fifth year onwards Org-High attracted a price premium of 20 to 50\% and this made it 1.3 to 4.1 times more profitable than Conv-High when selling on local and regional markets (in Chuka, Thika and Nairobi). Compared to Conv-High, partial N and K balances at the two sites were positive and higher in Org-High, except for N at Chuka. Our findings demonstrate that Org-High is productive, economically viable, resource-conserving and can contribute to sustainable agriculture production in Kenya depending on regional conditions and the crops cultivated.},

Diagrams show where learning opportunities exist in the three systems, and how the structure of the consumer-producer link influences learning processes. Implication assessments consider how each link may affect surrounding ecosystems and social aspects of the agri-food system. A framework for assessing a process of development identifies six components that contribute to agri-food system development. Four key issues are discussed in terms of their potential to significantly affect the development of the agri-food system: the length of the food chain linking producers and consumers, the definition of ?local?, learning in the system, and what is really being sold ? is it food, or values? Critical research questions are highlighted and recommended for future research.},

The current regulations do not impose strict requirements for SSF at farm level, but further restrictions are expected in future. The aim of the present work was to quantify SSF on a range of organic dairy farms in Norway and study farmers? strategies to produce milk with a high degree of SSF. Nine farms were selected for interview and data collection. On farm level, the proportion of SSF varied between 66 and 99 \%. SSF increased to 88-100 \% when expressed on national level. Land area is among the limiting factors for famers to reach higher SSF while maintaining the milk production level. A lower proportion of concentrates in the diet seems to have as strong impact on SSF as using own cereals and protein crops as feed, but milk production per total feed production area was highest for the latter. The farmers? goals and actions are important driving forces to develop more SSF in dairy production systems.},

        abstract = {Food losses occur throughout the entire food chain, from primary production via postharvest handling and storage, to food processing, distribution, retailing and consumption. Globally, food losses account for about one third of the total food produced for human consumption. The aim of this report was to map the production and utilisation of co-streams in the food processing industry in Norway and to discuss possibilities for alternative utilisation based on qualitative aspects of the co-streams, and current legislation. This report is produced by work package 3 in the CYCLE project (2013-2016), ?Total utilisation of raw materials in the supply chain for food with a bio-economical perspective?. The CYCLE project aims to improve resource utilisation in the Norwegian food chain by developing sustainable eco-friendly bio-processes and novel technology, in close relationship with food industry partners. Inputs and outputs of organic materials were roughly mapped at selected food processing plants presenting three Norwegian food chains: 1) Vegetables and potatoes; 2) white and pelagic fish; and 3) poultry. Data was collected during plant visits in June 2013, and later checked by staff from the described plants. The report describes the qualitative properties of co-streams, and their current utilisation as feed, fertiliser and as substrate for bioenergy production. We also present relevant regulations in EU and Norway regarding processing and utilisation of co-streams, and discuss alternative utilisation. Altogether, the food processing plants had significant market shares in Norway within fresh potatoes (38\%), lettuce (17\%), poultry meat (24\%) and white and pelagic fish, where export makes up a large proportion. Generally, a large proportion of the raw materials were utilised as food and feed. On average for all plants, 75\% of the raw material was utilised in food products, 21\% in feed products, 1\% in fertiliser and bioenergy production and 3\% was deposited in landfill. The plants used in average 8.6 tonnes of process water per tonne of food produced, but the amount varied considerably between the plants. Possible improvements in the utilisation of raw materials and co-streams include a higher degree of utilisation in food products, and developing new or improved feed components from co-streams with increased nutritional value. Due to the current high degree of utilisation in food and feed applications with high economic values, the potential for bioenergy and fertiliser production is limited to certain risk materials. Feed potatoes and vegetables and feathers, bones, blood, viscera and skin from fish or poultry have considerable potential for better utilisation for food or feed. Relevant processing methods for these co-streams are fractionation, hydrolysis, fermentation and drying.},

        abstract = {Maize (Zea mays L.) is a major staple food in Sub-Saharan Africa but low soil fertility, limited resources and droughts keep yields low. Cultivation of maize intercropped with pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L. Millsp.) is common in some areas of eastern and southern Africa. The objectives of this study were (1) to investigate dry matter, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) accumulation in different plant components of maize-pigeonpea intercropping systems and (2) to report the effects of the intercrops on soil fertility. Maize-pigeonpea intercrops were compared to sole maize grown using farmers? practices. Intercropping maize and pigeonpea increased (P{\ensuremath{<}}0.05) total system yield compared to sole maize in terms of biomass, N and P accumulation. Pigeonpea planted in maize did not reduce (P{\ensuremath{<}}0.05) the accumulation of dry matter, N nor P in the maize grain. The harvest indices of maize, calculated on basis dry matter, N or P did not differ either (P{\ensuremath{<}}0.05). Total soil C and N contents and inorganic N content, nitrate and ammonium, were not affected by two seasons of maize-pigeonpea intercropping compared to sole maize (P{\ensuremath{>}}0.11). Nitrate and ammonium levels in soil were still not affected by the treatments after the soils were incubated in anaerobic conditions for 8 days at 37?C (P{\ensuremath{>}}0.11). However, pigeonpea added up to 60 kg of N ha-1 to the system and accumulated up to 6 kg of P ha-1 and only 25\% of this N and P were exported in the grain. In conclusion, beside the added grain yield of pigeonpea in the intercropped systems, pigeonpea increased the recirculation of dry matter, N and P which may have a long-term effect on soil fertility. Furthermore, the stems from pigeonpea contributed to household fuel wood consumption. The intercropped system thus had multiple benefits that gave significant increase in combined yield per unit area without additional labour requirements. The main requirement in order to up-scale the maize-pigeonpea intercropping approach is sufficient supply of high-quality pigeonpea seeds.}

No entanto, os processos tecnologicos associados a disponibilidade dos fatores capital e mao-de-obra sao capazes de influenciar fortemente os niveis de produtividade e de producao a serem obtidos em dado meio fisico agroeco1ogico. Dessa forma, o conhecimento da eficiencia no uso dos fatores em zonas agroecologicas, similares quanto a sua estrutura de producao, pode indicar o seu uso mais racional. Pretende-se, neste trabalho, estimar a eficiencia/ ineficiencia tecnica no uso dos fatores de producao em zonas agroecologicas brasileiras. Para tal, especificamente procurou-se: agrupar e caracterizar as zonas agroecol{\'o}gicas brasileiras de acordo com sua estrutura de producao; estimar e comparar os niveis, inter e intragrupais, de eficiencia/ineficiencia tecnica dos fatores de producao. Para alcancar o primeiro objetivo utilizaram-se duas tecnicas de analise mu 1 1 ivariada, a saber: a analise fatorial em componentes principais e a hier{\'a}rquica aglomerativa. O segundo objetivo foi alcancado mediante a estimativa, inter e intragrupal, do indice geral de eficiencia tecnica, obtida atraves das diferencas encontradas entre os interceptos da funcao de produ{\c c}{\~a}o fronteira e do calculo do indice parcial da efici{\^e}ncia tecnica, dado pela produtividade media dos fatores de producao. Pode-se concluir, portanto, que a analise permitiu caracterizar as diferentes realidades regionais, tornando possivel identificar regioes diferenciadas quanto a estrutura de producao e quanto aos niveis de efici{\^e}ncia tecnica dos fatores de producao. Essa analise pode ser utilizada como base de conhecimento sistematizado que, em termos de planejamento agricola, atenda as caracter{\'i}sticas regionais da estrutura de producao e busque o desenvolvimento de tecnologia apropriada para os diferentes ecossistemas.

        abstract = {The EU Farm to Fork strategy acknowledges that ?food systems cannot be resilient to crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic
if they are not sustainable?, and that ?we need to redesign our food systems which today account for nearly one-third of global GHG emissions, consume large amounts of natural resources, result in biodiversity loss and negative health impacts (due to both under- and over-nutrition) and do not allow fair economic returns and livelihoods for all actors, in particular for primary producers.?
To achieve this transition to sustainable food systems, the Farm to Fork strategy highlights a range of solutions. It calls for a reduction in synthetic pesticides and fertiliser use, and in the use of antimicrobials; it also calls for an increased share of land under organic farming, and for mainstreaming precision farming and the use of artificial intelligence.
The crisis we face, due to the impacts of climate change, the collapse of biodiversity and ecosystems, pandemics or wars, renders even more urgent a transition to agroecological food systems which are more resilient and less dependent on external inputs. The organic movement believes that, more than ever, the Green Deal and the Farm to Fork strategy remain the right policy direction to transform our food system.
This is why digitalisation should not be conceived only as a technological fix to the current input-intensive agriculture model, aimed at alleviating marginally some of its destructive impacts while increasing corporate control and further disempowering farmers. Issues of control and ownership of data are by now well-identified in the public discussion, and digitalisation and agroecology sometimes appear in the debate as two dominating and conflicting narratives on what the future of agriculture should be. But we need to go further and collectively find ways to ensure that processes of digitalisation actually contribute to this transformation of the food system, along with the principles of organic farming and agroecology.
Indeed, agroecology is a way to express the four principles of organic farming (health, fairness, ecology and care). Organic agriculture and agroecology have common principles and drivers, and the organic movement sees itself as an integral part of the movement and science for agroecology. In the European context, agroecological practices are mostly applied on the ground by organic farmers.},

Euroopas on mahes{\"u}steemis kasvatatud nisu saagikus keskmisena 30 ? 40\% madalam kui tavas{\"u}steemis kasvatatud nisul, seda enam tuleb hinnata erinevates s{\"u}steemides kasvatatud nisu kvaliteeti.

Pehmema nisutera jahvatamisel saadakse {\"u}ldjuhul rohkem ebaregulaarse kuju ja v{\"a}ikese diameetriga osakesi, mis v{\"a}hendavad jahu voolavust, p{\~o}hjustades seadmete ummistusi (Evers ja Millar, 2002). T{\"a}nap{\"a}eva jahuveskites suunatakse esmaselt purustatud terad sageli uuesti ringlusse, et saavutada v{\~o}imalikult v{\"a}ikese tuhasisaldusega jahu. Mida suurem on p{\"u}{\"u}lijahu saak juba p{\"a}rast esmast terade purustamist, seda {\"o}konoomsem  on tootmine (Campbell jt.,  2007).
Keskkond m{\~o}jutab nisuterade endospermis olevate t{\"a}rkliseterade suurust ja suuremate ning v{\"a}iksemate t{\"a}rkliseterade arvukust ning omavahelist suhet (Edwards, 2010). T{\"a}rkliseterade suurus ja arvukus m{\"a}{\"a}rab nisujahu k{\"u}psetusomadused (taigna kerkimine, venivus, tugevus, p{\"a}tside suurus jms).

Mida rohkem on suuri A-t{\"u}{\"u}pi t{\"a}rkliseteri, seda paremad on nisujahu k{\"u}psetusomadused, st p{\"a}tsi kerkimine ja struktuur on parem. V{\"a}iksemad ning jahvatamisel kahjustada saanud t{\"a}rkliseterad suurendavad jahu veeimavusv{\~o}imet ehk seda vee kogust, mis on vajalik taigna valmistamiseks. Sellisel juhul pikeneb ka taigna segamise aeg (Park jt., 2005). 
Toitainete, eelk{\~o}ige l{\"a}mmastiku k{\"a}ttesaadavus mahe- ja tavas{\"u}steemis on erinev ja see tingib ka t{\"a}rkliseterade hulga ja suuruse erinevuse s{\"u}steemides.

        abstract = {Nitrogen (N) deficiency is a major problem in organic and low-input farming systems. Growing spring cereals with undersown legumes has a positive effect on soil fertility, enriching it with nitrogen, through symbiosis of legumes with nodule bacteria. Two hypotheses were tested: 1) undersowing of red clover increases the protein content of barley grains and 2) mineral N has negative aftereffect on growth of legume plants. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of organic (cattle manure, off-season cover crop) and mineral N in organic and conventional farming systems on (i) barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) grain yield and quality, (ii) biomass yield formation of undersown red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and (iii) the aftereffect of mineral and organic N fertilisers on the red clover crop biomass yield in the following year. The experiment was established in 2008 at the Estonian University of Life Sciences (58?22? N, 26?40? E) on the soil described as Stagnic Albic Luvisol (LV ab-st) (WRB, 2014) with sandy loam surface texture, 1.38\% C, 0.13\% N, 133 mg kg-1 P, 210 mg kg-1 K and pHKCl 6.0. The crops were treated using different farming systems: three organic (Org0, OrgI and OrgII) and four conventional (N0, N40, N80 and N120); nitrogen sources during crop cycle period: N0 and Org0 = symbiotically fixed atmospheric N2, N40 = N2 + mineral N 40 kg ha-1 N, N80 = N2 + mineral N 80 kg ha-1 N, N120 = N2 + mineral N 120 kg ha-1 N, OrgI = N2 + N taken up by cover crops (NCC) and OrgII = N2 + NCC + N applied with manure (Nm). Our study revealed that grain yield of barley was strongly affected by undersown red clover; because of competition for nutrients in cereallegume mixture the grain yield of barley in organic system was 11?61\% lower than that in conventional system. The seed rate of undersown red clover (2.84 million viable seed per ha) was too high. The content of proteiin depended on the availability of mineralised nitrogen. The mean protein content of barley grains over the trial years and treatments was 99 {$\pm$} 1.6 g kg-1 in the conventional system, which was 17\% higher than that in the organic system. Undersowing of red clover had no significantly positive effect on the grain yield and protein content of barley. Mineral N fertiliser had no negative aftereffect on growth of the red clover crop the following year. Mean above ground biomass yield over the trial years for the red clover crop 2nd cut was 17\% higher in the conventional system than in the organic system.},

It may be seen as a ?commons?, that has to be shaped and developed by new types of collective commitments to study. Two French experiences in that perspective aiming to protect water resources and led by local authorities have been analyzed. The study shows that the local authority behaves as a facilitator of territorial development plan. It acts through two complementary levers, the control of supply (land and ownership) and demand (institutional catering). Whereas environmental efficiency remains to be proved, the projects rely on an increasing collective mobilization and develop according to their ability for budding and territorial rooting. New modes of governance appear, that raise the questions of a local authority positioning in such plans and the invention of mixed institutional arrangements.},

Literature information, interviews with stinglessbee beekeepers, and expeditions were conducted to confirm the natural occurrence of the species. A total of 102 municipalities showed records for M. scutellaris, whose occurrence was observed in areas ranging from sea level up to 1,200-meter height. The occurrence of this species in the state of Bahia is considered to be restricted to municipalities on the coastal area and the Chapada Diamantina with its rainforests. Geographic coordinates, elevation, climate and vegetation data were obtained, which allowed a map to be prepared for the area of occurrence in order to support conservation and management policies for the species.},

Previous studies suggest widespread positive responses of biodiversity to organic farming. Many of these studies, however, have been small-scale. The purpose of this project was to test the generality of responses to arable organic farming (i.e. cereal-growing farms) in England through a multi-taxa study of a large number of farms. Abundance and diversity of higher plants, spiders, carabid beetles, wintering birds and bats were measured on matched pairs of organic and conventionally managed farms. Extent and potential quality of non-crop habitat were also measured. Two key issues addressed by the project were (a) whether biodiversity differences between organic and conventional systems arise from amount and management of non-crop habitat or from differences in crop management systems and (b) the importance of duration under organic management.
Plants and invertebrates were examined in 89 pairs of cereal fields (target fields). Birds and bats were studied at a larger spatial scale, extending over several fields on each study farm. Virtually all suitable organic farms in England were studied. The farm pairing procedure was purely geographical and not based on any attributes of either system. Target fields were stratified by cereal type (spring or winter sown) and by age since conversion.
Habitat and management comparisons were carried out at landscape, farm and field scales using data collected in the field and existing landscape datasets (Land Cover Map 2000 and CS2000 field survey data). Within England, organic farms tended to be located to the south of the wheat-growing region, in areas with more grassland than conventional farms. It is difficult to disassociate many landscape level variables from farming system. Organic arable farms were more often mixed farms than their conventional counterparts, leading to smaller field sizes, livestock-proof hedges, diverse rotations and greater extents of grassland. Hedges on organic farms occurred at higher density (length per unit area) and were taller, wider and less gappy than those on conventional farms. All these factors are likely to enhance many components of biodiversity. By contrast, conventional farms were more likely to contain stubble and naturally regenerated set-aside which can be beneficial to wildlife.
This study has confirmed that organic systems do generally support higher levels of biodiversity but that the differences are often quite small. Some, but not all, differences in biodiversity between systems appear to be a consequence of differences in habitat quantity. Plants and invertebrates appear to be responding mainly to crop management practices that are intrinsic to the system. Birds and bats benefit from increased quantities of various non-crop habitats and higher diversity of habitats on organic but this does not account for all differences between systems in these groups. Few relationships with duration of organic management were detected. This may be partly because it was not possible to account for pre-conversion management.
We highlight the potential value to biodiversity on conventional farms of non-crop habitat management (especially hedges), mixed farming and the incorporation of ?organic? field margins. High priority areas for future related research include the potential biodiversity benefits of organic livestock farming, long-term controlled studies on responses to conversion, and the effect of extent of organic management at larger scales.},

          author = {ANON},
        abstract = {The organic unit at ADAS Redesdale was established to evaluate the physical and financial implications of converting a progressive hill/upland unit to an organic system. Conversion of 400 ha, 600 breeding ewes (in 3 flocks) and 35 suckler cows was completed in 1993. One organic flock (Organic Dipper ) was managed as a direct comparison with a conventionally managed system (Conventional Dipper).  During the early years following conversion, an organic system was developed which, financially, enabled the organic unit to compete favourably with a comparable conventional system. This was on the basis of maintaining similar stocking rates, and pushing the organic system towards maximum output.  As the experiment progressed, it became increasingly clear that a different balance of farming and environmental objectives were required if the broader ecological and ethical objectives of organic farming were to be better met. Stocking rate reductions had been made in two of the organically managed flocks (Cairn and Burnhead)  in 1995. On the basis of the divergence in flock and individual animal performance, and following recommendations by the Project Steering Committee, sheep stocking rates were reduced by 25\% on the Organic Dipper flock from November 2000. From mating in November 2001, breeding ewe numbers on the Burnhead flock were reduced by a further 45\% in line with Countryside Stewardship prescriptions. 
The overall objective of the study was to compare the long-term performance of organic and conventional hill and upland systems. The project was funded as a one-year extension, pending a review of  DEFRA?s organic research programme. The 2000/01 production year covered in this report, represented the eighth year under full organic production, and coincided with the redirection of management on the unit towards better integration with agri-environmental objectives. Data were collected on physical and financial performance, animal health and welfare, and market performance. However, the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in February 2001, forced management changes, which significantly affected the systems comparison. Absolute results therefore need to be viewed against this background.
Eight commercial organic farms were costed to provide information on physical and financial performance (related to 2000 born lamb and calf crops) in support of the main study. Stocking rates varied from 0.6 to 1.6 grazing livestock units (GLU) per adjusted hectare. Across the sample of farms, the effect of replacing HLCA (Hill Farming Compensatory Allowance) with HFA (Hill Farming Allowance) in 2000 was generally neutral, but tended to favour more extensive systems. Performance of sheep and cattle were within expected limits for hill and upland production. Farm output ({\pounds} per adjusted hectare) was {\pounds}770, {\pounds}407, and {\pounds}592 for linked farms, Newcastle University and IRS FBS costed farms respectively. Whole farm gross margin averaged {\pounds}587/adj. ha (range {\pounds}265 ? {\pounds}628), representing extensive and value added production systems respectively. Fixed costs ranged from {\pounds}332 - {\pounds}498, compared with fixed costs of {\pounds}184 and {\pounds}337 for Newcastle and IRS respectively. Based on the identical sample of five farms, average Net Farm Income (NFI) was {\pounds}46/adj. ha higher in 2000 than in the previous year. On all but one farm, NFI was equal or lower than the value of manual labour from the farmer and his spouse, resulting in a negative Management and Investment Income. 
It is difficult to draw precise conclusions on the performance of the organic unit during 2001, given the disruption to management caused by FMD. However, the relative physical performance of organic and conventional systems was  broadly in line with previous  years. Choice of stocking level and the availability of market premia for organic stock will have a profound effect on animal performance and economic return. Good levels of technical performance are increasingly important, as the price differentials between organic and conventional beef and lamb are eroded. Added value strategies such as direct selling, can significantly boost returns, but are not universally applicable. To generate significant ecological improvements a much more proactive management approach is required. Information from the linked farm study shows that organic farmers are generally willing to spend money on conservation projects. However, in order to make this investment a level of underlying profitability is required. The linked farm study also shows that once conversion aid payments are no longer payable, only a minority of organic hill/upland beef and sheep farms make a significant profit.  With profitability increasingly fragile, and organic beef imports running at approximately 35\%, any major changes in the organic standards which increase the costs of production could have a disproportionate effect.},

        abstract = {A long-term experiment at two trial sites in Kenya has been on-going since 2007 to assess the effect of organic and conventional farming systems on productivity, profitability and sustainability. During these trials the presence of significant numbers of termites (Isoptera) was observed. Termites are major soil macrofauna and within literature they are either depict as ?pests? or as important indicator for environmental sustainability. The extent by which termites may be managed to avoid crop damage, but improve sustainability of farming systems is worthwhile to understand. Therefore, a study on termites was added to the long-term experiments in Kenya. The objectives of the study were to quantify the effect of organic (Org) and conventional (Conv) farming systems at two input levels (low and high) on the abundance, incidence, diversity and foraging activities of termites.
The results showed higher termite abundance, incidence, activity and diversity in Org-High compared to Conv-High, Conv-Low and Org-Low. However, the termite presence in each system was also dependent on soil depth, trial site and cropping season. During the experiment, nine different termite genera were identified, that belong to three subfamilies: (i) Macrotermitinae (genera: Allodontotermes, Ancistrotermes, Macrotermes, Microtermes, Odontotermes and Pseudocanthotermes), (ii) Termitinae (Amitermes and Cubitermes) and (iii) Nasutitiermitinae (Trinervitermes).
We hypothesize that the presence of termites within the different farming systems might be influenced by the types of input applied, the soil moisture content and the occurrence of natural enemies. Our findings further demonstrate that the organic high input system attracts termites, which are an important, and often beneficial, component of soil fauna. This further increases the potential of such systems in enhancing sustainable agricultural production in Kenya.},

The farming systems were established in 2007 at two input levels: Low input level, representing subsistence farming (Conv-Low, Org-Low) and high input level, representing commercial farming (Conv-High, Org-High). Termite-induced injuries to maize and baby corn, such as tunneling the stem or lodging the whole plant were assessed over two cropping seasons. The lodging occurred exclusively at Thika. It first became apparent in the Org-Low system, with most of lodging occurring during the vegetative stage. Baby corn grown under high input systems showed increasing lodging from the late vegetative crop stage and peaked before the final harvest. Tunneling was recorded at both sites, but was generally below 5\%, with no significant differences between the farming systems. Overall, the injury patterns caused by termites appear to be a function of the plant growth stage, termite colony activities, trial site, and the types and levels of fertilizer input. Thus, the management practice used in each farming system (organic or conventional) might have greater influence on crop injuries than the type of farming system itself or the termite abundance within each system.}

        abstract = {This study investigated phosphorus (P) retention materials of sand and limestone outside houses in paddocks for organic laying hens, as a measure to retain P and reduce leaching. When manure P, accumulated in the materials during 6 months, was exposed to rain simulations in a lysimeter study, P concentrations in drainage water were high from all treatments (58-136 and 130-197 mg L-1 of PO4-P and total-P respectively).  On average, 14\% of the manure P, captured in the materials was leached after 100 mm of simulated rainfall. The conclusion is that these materials may efficiently retain P during the outdoor season (May to October), but in order to reduce the risk of losses to waters during the following winter they need to be removed from the paddocks, preferably to arable fields.  The materials can be regarded as potential P fertilizers and may thereby combine increased P use efficiency and environmental performance of organic outdoor poultry systems.},

Aktiviteter i marken lige nu
P{\r a} Jyndevad er alle afgr{\o}derne h{\o}stet og p{\r a} Foulum mangler kun lupinerne. P{\r a} Flakkebjerg er kornafgr{\o}derne modne og der ventes kun p{\r a} t{\o}rvejr. Den sidste nedb{\o}r var godt for b{\r a}de udl{\ae}g, kl{\o}vergr{\ae}s og roer p{\r a} Flakkebjerg. Der har som forventet v{\ae}ret store variationer mellem afgr{\o}der og behandlinger p{\r a} de enkelte lokaliteter og mellem lokaliteterne. N{\r a}r korn og fr{\o} er t{\o}rret og vejet kan vi f{\r a} sat tal p{\r a} forskellene. 

Fra misv{\ae}kst til god v{\ae}kst i havren   
P{\r a} Foulum har havren hvert {\r a}r udviklet sig godt og kraftigt, is{\ae}r i g{\o}dede parceller. P{\r a} Flakkebjerg har v{\ae}ksten derimod ikke v{\ae}ret s{\r a} god. I {\r a}r ser det helt galt ud i havren og is{\ae}r i systemet med fangafgr{\o}de hvor havren er s{\r a}et i opfr{\ae}sede b{\r a}nd i hvidkl{\o}ver. {\r A}rsagen til den ringe v{\ae}kst er sandsynligvis en sen s{\r a}ning som f{\o}lge af det v{\r a}de for{\r a}r, en efterf{\o}lgende lang og t{\o}r periode samt en h{\r a}rd konkurrence fra hvidkl{\o}veren. 

Problemukrudt
Ud over kvik og tidsler som vi sl{\r a}s med p{\r a} flere af lokaliteterne er vi ogs{\r a} ved at f{\r a} problemer med svinem{\ae}lk p{\r a} Foulum og Holeby, f{\o}lfod p{\r a} Jyndevad og agerpadderokke p{\r a} Flakkebjerg. De n{\ae}vnte ukrudtsarter optr{\ae}der meget massivt i nogle f{\r a} parceller. Vi kan dog frygte at de vil brede sig.  Et problem er, at vi mangler viden om hvordan disse ukrudtsarter bedst kan rammes. En hel{\r a}rsbrak kunne sikkert l{\o}se en del af problemerne. En v{\ae}sentlig ulempe ved en l{\ae}ngere brakperiode er imidlertid at vi mister b{\r a}de en produktionsafgr{\o}de og en masse kv{\ae}lstof gennem udvaskning. Erfaringer fra l{\ae}sere modtages meget gerne.

Lupinerne driller 
I s{\ae}dskifternes anden rotation som startede i {\r a}r byttede vi {\ae}rterne ud med lupin med henblik p{\r a} at undg{\r a} opformering af s{\ae}dskifteb{\r a}rne {\ae}rtesygdomme. Lupinerne har generelt v{\ae}ret d{\r a}rlige i konkurrencen med ukrudtet og mange af parcellerne er derfor meget beskidte. N{\ae}ste {\r a}r vil lupinerne blive s{\r a}et p{\r a} dobbelt r{\ae}kkeafstand s{\r a} vi kan radrense. P{\r a} Jyndevad har vi i {\r a}r haft kraftige angreb af gr{\r a}skimmel p{\r a} lupinerne. Det har medf{\o}rt en alt for tidlig nedvisning og modning af en i {\o}vrigt meget flot afgr{\o}de. Gr{\r a}skimmel er en svamp som findes alle steder. D{\o}dt plantemateriale fra affaldende kronblade og fugtigt vejr fremmer svampen. En medvirkende faktor til det h{\r a}rde angreb kan v{\ae}re vanding. 

S{\r a}tid af hvede p{\r a} Foulum
For at f{\r a} en kraftigere for{\r a}rsv{\ae}kst i vinterhveden p{\r a} Foulum valgte vi sidste {\r a}r at s{\r a} hveden i starten af september. I f{\o}rste rotation l{\r a} s{\r a}tiden omkring 1. oktober. Hveden udviklede sig godt efter den tidlige s{\r a}ning, men p{\r a} grund af d{\r a}rlig s{\r a}s{\ae}d som gav uens og tynd fremspiring samt en fugtig jord m{\r a}tte vi af hensyn til kornet droppe de tidlige ukrudtsstriglinger i forbindelse med fremspiringen. Det sker ikke ustraffet p{\r a} en jord med kamille. Selv i vores systemer uden fangafgr{\o}de hvor vi kunne radrense b{\r a}de efter{\r a}r og for{\r a}r har kamillerne udviklet sig kraftigt udfra kornr{\ae}kkerne. P{\r a} trods af de mange kamiller har vi valgt at bibeholde det tidlige s{\r a}tidspunkt. I {\r a}r har vi selv lavet s{\r a}s{\ae}den, og efter kontrol for uds{\ae}dsb{\r a}rne sygdomme samt frarensning af sm{\r a} kerner h{\r a}ber vi at kunne opn{\r a} en t{\ae}t og ensartet fremspiring i r{\ae}kkerne s{\r a} kornet kan holde til en kraftig ukrudtsstrigling.

Aktiviteter i marken lige nu

Der kan v{\ae}re langt mellem planer og virkelighed, is{\ae}r hvis  vejret driller. Det har v{\ae}ret s{\r a} v{\r a}dt, at v{\r a}rs{\ae}den f{\o}rst nu, i skrivende stund d. 2. maj, er blevet s{\r a}et p{\r a} Flakkebjerg. Gyllen blev k{\o}rt ud tidligere p{\r a} t{\o}r overflade, men som f{\o}lge af vejrforholdene var der desv{\ae}rre en stor fugtighed i pl{\o}jelaget. Det gav grimme spor som sandsynligvis vil kunne ses resten af v{\ae}ksts{\ae}sonen.  Jorden p{\r a} Flakkebjerg er i forvejen meget kompakt og vi har tidligere set v{\ae}ksth{\ae}mning af afgr{\o}derne fordi r{\o}dderne har haft sv{\ae}rt ved at udvikle sig i jorden. I dyrkningssystemer med lavt input af n{\ae}ringsstoffer er god rodudvikling en foruds{\ae}tning for et godt udbytte.
P{\r a} den grovsandede jord p{\r a} Jyndevad blev v{\r a}rs{\ae}den s{\r a}et den 9. april. Normalt tager fremspiringen kun 7-10 dage, men det k{\o}lige vejr medf{\o}rte at v{\r a}rs{\ae}den f{\o}rst spirede frem efter 17-18 dage. Nu har v{\r a}rs{\ae}den udviklet 1-1? blad og lupinens f{\o}rste l{\o}vblad er ved at folde sig ud. Havren er m{\o}rkegr{\o}n mens v{\r a}rbyggen er lidt mere gullig. Den ser ud til at mangle varme. Graver man nogle af de fremspirende planter op ses et flot og op til 10 cm dybt rodnet. P{\r a} Foulum blev v{\r a}rs{\ae}den s{\r a}et den 12. april, og i skrivende stund ses begyndende og ensartet fremspiring.

Kl{\o}vergr{\ae}sset 
Man skal ikke lade sig snyde af en d{\r a}rlig kl{\o}verbestand sidst p{\r a} vinteren. Hvor der n{\ae}sten ikke kunne ses hvidkl{\o}ver i februar st{\r a}r der nu flere steder en fin udviklet kl{\o}verbestand. Andelen af kl{\o}ver i kl{\o}vergr{\ae}s som er udlagt i g{\o}det v{\r a}rbyg er ikke s{\r a} stor som i de marker hvor v{\r a}rbyggen har v{\ae}ret ug{\o}det. Det skyldes en st{\ae}rkere konkurrence fra den g{\o}dede v{\r a}rbyg. P{\r a} Foulum har vi fors{\o}gt at reparere kl{\o}vergr{\ae}sset i det tidlige for{\r a}r i de omr{\r a}der hvor kl{\o}verbestanden var svag , men fremspiringen af det is{\r a}ede ser ikke overbevisende ud. Vi h{\r a}ber p{\r a} at den etablerede hvidkl{\o}ver vil fylde hullerne ud i l{\o}bet af de n{\ae}ste m{\r a}neder.       

Ukrudtet
Skraber man i det {\o}verste jordlag ses m{\ae}ngder af lange hvide tr{\r a}de. Det er de kommende ukrudtsplanter som er p{\r a} vej. P{\r a} Foulum har vi haft sv{\ae}rt ved at kontrollere ukrudtet i tilstr{\ae}kkelig omfang i de afgr{\o}der hvor der blandt andet etableres kl{\o}vergr{\ae}sudl{\ae}g. Nu fors{\o}ger vi os med en strategi hvor 2/3 af kl{\o}vergr{\ae}s-uds{\ae}den blandes og s{\r a}s sammen med v{\r a}rbyggen. Dette giver mulighed for at udf{\o}re en ukrudtsharvning efter fremspiring til at tage toppen af ukrudtsproblemet. Efterf{\o}lgende uds{\r a}r vi  igen 2/3 af normal uds{\ae}dsm{\ae}ngde af kl{\o}vergr{\ae}sfr{\o}et. Resultatet er et overforbrug af fr{\o} i forhold til normalen, men vi tager ingen chancer n{\r a}r det drejer sig om at etablere kl{\o}vergr{\ae}smarken som jo st{\r a}r for en stor del af N-forsyningen til s{\ae}dskiftet.    
   
Tidligt s{\r a}et vinters{\ae}d st{\r a}r godt
Vinters{\ae}den p{\r a} Jyndevad og Foulum blev s{\r a}et tidligere end vi plejer; rugen p{\r a} Jyndevad sidst i august og vinters{\ae}den p{\r a} Foulum i starten af september. Resultatet er meget veletablerede planter som har busket sig godt. Men hvor der er fordele er der som regel ogs{\r a} ulemper. Ulempen er at ukrudtet ogs{\r a} f{\r a}r gode muligheder for at udvikle sig. For at reducere problemet blev der allerede i efter{\r a}ret blev der udf{\o}rt flere striglinger p{\r a} Jyndevad og radrensninger p{\r a} Foulum. Det er tydeligt, at det har hjulpet meget. Kamillerne i r{\ae}kkerne kan vi dog ikke stille noget op med, og de vil senere p{\r a} s{\ae}sonen s{\ae}tte deres hvide sk{\ae}r over kornet.

Marken nu
I skrivende stund er h{\o}sten i hus p{\r a} Foulum og Holeby og p{\r a} Jyndevad mangler kun lupin. Udbytterne er ikke gjort op, men meget tyder p{\r a} at niveauet i Foulum og Jyndevad bliver det samme som sidste {\r a}r mens Holeby melder om h{\o}je udbytter, i vinterhvede op over 80 hkg kerne/ha. De nye udl{\ae}g af kl{\o}vergr{\ae}s og efterafgr{\o}der st{\r a}r generelt p{\ae}nt. P{\r a} Foulum ligger den snittede halm visse steder i et tykt lag over udl{\ae}gget. Det bliver derfor n{\o}dvendigt med en ekstra overk{\o}rsel med snitter for undg{\r a} kv{\ae}lning af udl{\ae}gget. 

Problemer med kl{\o}veren 
Sidste {\r a}rs udl{\ae}g af kl{\o}vergr{\ae}s i v{\r a}rbyggen p{\r a} Foulum resulterede i meget forskellig udvikling af afgr{\o}den, fra meget kl{\o}verrige parceller til parceller n{\ae}sten uden kl{\o}ver. V{\ae}rst s{\r a} det ud i  de g{\o}dede parceller hvor v{\r a}rbyggen sammen med en stor ukrudtsm{\ae}ngde ud{\o}vede en alt for h{\r a}rd konkurrence overfor kl{\o}veren. I et fors{\o}g p{\r a} at reparere p{\r a} skaden opfr{\ae}sede vi, midt juni, 14 cm brede b{\r a}nd i 5-6 cm dybde. I disse striber blev is{\r a}et en blanding af fodervikke og persisk kl{\o}ver. Fremspiringen var nogenlunde i orden, men efterf{\o}lgende har desv{\ae}rre kun f{\r a} planter udviklet sig. 
Resultatet af n{\ae}sten rene rajgr{\ae}s-parceller som forfrugt til vinterhvede vil sandsynligvis kunne m{\ae}rkes i form af ringere udbytter til n{\ae}ste {\r a}r. 

P{\r a} Jyndevad observerede vi sidste efter{\r a}r, i fors{\o}gsled uden husdyrg{\o}dning, nogle kl{\o}vergr{\ae}s-parceller med meget ringe kl{\o}verbestand. Mistanken gik p{\r a} kalium-mangel, men kl{\o}veren havde ikke de karakteristiske hvide pletter p{\r a} bladene og analyser af kalium-indhold i de tiloversblevne kl{\o}verplanter tydede heller ikke p{\r a} at der var tale om kalium-mangel. I for{\r a}ret blev der anlagt et kalium-g{\o}dningsfors{\o}g. Fors{\o}get er endnu ikke opgjort, men der ses tydeligt mere kl{\o}ver i udl{\ae}gget i de kalium-g{\o}dede parceller end i de parceller som ikke er tilf{\o}rt kalium.

Tidlig s{\r a}ning af vinters{\ae}den
Efter en fuld rotation p{\r a} 4 {\r a}r med s{\ae}dskifterne har vi foretaget nogle justeringer med henblik p{\r a} den n{\ae}ste rotation. Blandt andet erstattes vinterhveden p{\r a} Jyndevad med rug, og s{\r a}tidspunkterne af vinters{\ae}den rykkes frem p{\r a} b{\r a}de Jyndevad og Foulum. 

P{\r a} Jyndevad blev rugen s{\r a}et midt i august og den var spiret frem 5 dage senere. Rugen s{\r a}s p{\r a} normal r{\ae}kkeafstand med 250 planter/m2. Begrundelsen for at s{\r a} tidligt p{\r a} Jyndevad er {\o}nsket om at udnytte rugen som en effektiv fangafgr{\o}de efter kl{\o}vergr{\ae}sset. Det vurderes, at ukrudtsharvninger i kombination med rugens gode konkurrenceevne kan klare ukrudtet s{\r a}ledes at radrensning kan undv{\ae}res.  

P{\r a} Foulum skal vi have etableret b{\r a}de rug og hvede i dette efter{\r a}r. Rugen og hveden s{\r a}s i f{\o}rste uge af september p{\r a} dobbelt r{\ae}kkeafstand og med 250 planter/m2. Begrundelsen for at s{\r a} tidligt p{\r a} Foulum er prim{\ae}rt {\o}nsket om en tidligere v{\ae}kststart i for{\r a}ret. Foulum ligger i et koldt omr{\r a}de hvilket medvirker til at planterne kommer sent i gang med v{\ae}ksten om for{\r a}ret. Da vejrforholdene kan drille mere p{\r a} Foulum end i Jyndevad med hensyn til at kunne k{\o}re i marken anvendes dobbelt r{\ae}kkeafstand i vinters{\ae}den. Dette muligg{\o}r radrensning i b{\r a}de efter{\r a}r og for{\r a}r.

P{\r a} Flakkebjerg og Holeby er klimaet noget mildere end i Foulum, og der er ikke {\r a}benlyse fordele ved en v{\ae}sentlig fremrykning af s{\r a}ningen. Tv{\ae}rtimod kan der v{\ae}re den ulempe at ukrudtet i fugtige efter{\r a}r ikke kan reguleres p{\r a} grund af det h{\o}jere lerindhold. Vi rykker dog s{\r a}tiden en lille smule frem til omkring den 25. september. P{\r a} Flakkebjerg anvendes fortsat dobbelt r{\ae}kkeafstand, s{\r a} vi kan fors{\o}ge at bek{\ae}mpe tidsler med radrensning.

Lige nu i marken
Vi er kommet rigtig godt fra start p{\r a} alle de fire fors{\o}gslokaliteter. Afgr{\o}derne udvikler sig godt og ensartet. Der har endnu ikke vist sig problemer med sygdomme og skadedyr, heller ikke i sukkerroerne p{\r a} Flakkebjerg og Holeby. Dog ser vi p{\r a} alle lokaliteterne bladrandbillernes tydelige visitkort langs bladrandene af {\ae}rteplanterne. Det syn har vi dog v{\ae}nnet os til ? s{\r a}dan ser {\ae}rterne bare ud. Stankelbenlarver har vi heldigvis ikke set noget til siden 1998 p{\r a} Jyndevad, hvor de {\o}delagde flere af vores parceller med v{\r a}rhvede efter kl{\o}vergr{\ae}s. Vi ser begyndende tegn p{\r a} kv{\ae}lstofmangel i vinterhvede i de systemer som ikke tilf{\o}res gylle, ogs{\r a} hvor forfrugten er kl{\o}vergr{\ae}s. 

Etablering af udl{\ae}g
Udl{\ae}ggene, b{\r a}de kl{\o}vergr{\ae}s og efterafgr{\o}de, spirer meget fint frem. Vores etableringsmetode afh{\ae}nger af jordtypen. P{\r a} de lette jorde i Jyndevad og Foulum s{\r a}r vi i 1 cm dybde og uden brug af efterharve. Det betyder, at fr{\o}ene efter s{\r a}ning ligger i en fors{\ae}nket rille i jorden. Denne metode har alle {\r a}r givet en meget sikker fremspiring n{\r a}r de sm{\r a}fr{\o}ede kl{\o}verarter indg{\r a}r i blandingerne. P{\r a} lerjorden i Flakkebjerg er s{\r a}bedet meget knoldet. Her anvendes i stedet s{\r a}ning med l{\o}ftede s{\r a}tude og brug af efterharven for at ryste fr{\o}ene ned mellem jordknoldene.

Kl{\o}ver i kl{\o}vergr{\ae}smarkerne p{\r a} Foulum
P{\r a} Foulum ser vi i {\r a}r en markant forskel i kl{\o}verbestanden i kl{\o}vergr{\ae}smarkerne, fra h{\o}j bestand i nogle parceller til n{\ae}sten ingen kl{\o}ver i andre. Etableringen af kl{\o}verudl{\ae}gget sidste for{\r a}r fulgte den normale procedure. Dog drillede vejret s{\r a} s{\r a}ningen af udl{\ae}gget f{\o}rst skete 11 dage efter s{\r a}ning af d{\ae}ks{\ae}den. Men p{\r a} trods af vejrdrillerier var fremspiringen god. De store forskelle h{\ae}nger sammen med de grundl{\ae}ggende fors{\o}gsbehandlinger, nemlig gylle (med og uden) og efterafgr{\o}de (med og uden) som begge p{\r a}virker forsyningen af kv{\ae}lstof til afgr{\o}den. Og faktorer som p{\r a}virker forsyningen af kv{\ae}lstof til afgr{\o}den p{\r a}virker som bekendt ogs{\r a} konkurrenceforholdet mellem d{\ae}ks{\ae}d og udl{\ae}g. Hvor d{\ae}ks{\ae}den (v{\r a}rbyg) ikke havde en efterafgr{\o}de som forfrugt og heller ikke blev tildelt gylle finder vi i {\r a}r den h{\o}jeste kl{\o}verbestand. Her ydede v{\r a}rbyggen sidste {\r a}r kun 19 hkg kerne pr. ha p{\r a} Foulum. I parceller med efterafgr{\o}de og med gylle, hvor v{\r a}rbyggen gav over dobbelt s{\r a} meget nemlig 43 hkg kerne pr. ha, finder vi i {\r a}r en meget lille bestand af kl{\o}ver i kl{\o}vergr{\ae}sset. Vores vurdering er, at vi i systemer med h{\o}jt N-input til afgr{\o}den vil opleve kl{\o}vergr{\ae}smarker med en mindre kl{\o}verbestand og dermed mindre kv{\ae}lstof-fiksering. Kl{\o}vergr{\ae}smarkerne vil p{\r a} denne m{\r a}de kunne virke som en kv{\ae}lstof-st{\o}dpude i systemerne. Det bliver meget sp{\ae}ndende, at f{\r a} denne v{\ae}ksts{\ae}son med idet vi s{\r a} har den f{\o}rste fulde fuld rotation og dermed bliver istand til at sammenligne de forskellige s{\ae}dskifte-systemer, blandt andet med hensyn til kv{\ae}lstof, kl{\o}verbestande og udbytter.

Vores erfaring med bek{\ae}mpelse af stankelbenlarver
I et tidligere nummer af {\O}kologisk Jordbrug omtales fr{\ae}sning af jorden som et middel til at bek{\ae}mpe stankelbenlarver. Vores erfaringer fra Jyndevad er imidlertid, at fr{\ae}sning ikke kan klare problemet. Derimod fik vi et godt resultat ved at anvende en traktormonteret ?bredbr{\ae}nder? med varmeskjold. En efterf{\o}lgende opt{\ae}lling fandt vi op til 160 d{\o}de laver pr. m2. Br{\ae}ndingen blev udf{\o}rt sen aften og tidlig morgen hvor larverne typisk befinder sig oven p{\r a} jorden for at {\ae}de.

We investigated the effect of four organic farming systems on the exchangeable K in the plough layer of a six-course crop rotation from 1994 to 1997. The accumulated K balances over the four years varied between 
-49 and  +120 kg K ha-1 and the corresponding exchangeable K (0-20 cm) in autumn 1997 was 7.1 and 9.6 mg K 100 g soil-1, respectively, as an average of the crop rotation. The exchangeable K fraction responded to the K application in manure and to the crop in the rotation. In an additional experiment, no yield response to K was found, despite a low level of exchangeable K. The exchangeable K was a useful indicator of changes in the K status in the farming system with the largest positive K balance whereas this K fraction was insufficient as an indicator in the other three farming systems. The considerable variation of exchangeable K through the crop rotation makes the soil test method most suitable at the crop rotation level where fluctuations caused by crop and management are smoothed out.

Knowledge about potential K leaching in systems with different K budgets is therefore important for effective agricultural management. We investigated the effect of four organic farming systems (two livestock densities in combination with two types of organic manure) on crop yields, K leaching and K balances in a six course crop rotation from 1993/94 to 1997/98. Average K concentrations in soil water extracted by means of ceramic suction cups at 1 m depth were 0.6 mg K l-1 corresponding to a K leaching loss of 1.5 kg ha-1 yr-1,which was less than expected from values reported in the literature. Variation in K budgets from ?12 to +30 kg ha-1 yr-1 did not affect K leaching. In an additional experiment with application of 988 kg K ha-1 as KCl, K leaching accounted for only 0.2\% of the applied K although 40\% of the accompanying Cl was leached. The main part of the applied K was retained in the topsoil. It was concluded that K leaching was a result of the fertiliser history rather than of the current K budget.

Knowledge of the ancestral history of the domestic chicken, combined with research observations suggests benefits of agro-forestry systems for chickens. A commercial organic poultry agro-forestry system was developed for Sheepdrove Organic Farm, Berkshire, UK, affording the benefits of an agro-forestry system, whilst retaining commercial viability.  Five avenues of highly diverse parallel hedges incorporating tree, shrub and herb species were planted. On-going monitoring of the system was put in place to evaluate its development.  The programme consists of monitoring: 1) biodiversity 2) soil nutrient status and respiration 3) behaviour and welfare of the poultry.  Conventionally profits tend to be viewed purely in terms of economic gain.  However in an organic farm-ing system more emphasis is placed on the intrinsic and sustainable qualities it has.  Organic farming adopts a holistic approach to profit, viewing it in environmental, social and economic terms. The profits afforded by the agro-forestry system are discussed.

No entanto, pouco se tem observado como se da o processo de adocao deste sistema de producao por agricultores e consumidores para que se possa difundi-lo cada vez mais. A partir de entrevistas com produtores organicos fluminenses, procedeu-se a uma analise do processo de adocao deste tipo de agricultura e das dificuldades para sua difusao no Estado do Rio de Janeiro. Verificou-se que os agricultores entrevistados, possuidores de forte posicionamento ideologico, funcionam como importante vanguarda no processo de difusao, o qual, para ser incrementado devera ter, necessariamente o aporte de politicas agricolas que atendam este setor. Buscou-se verificar ainda, tambem atraves de entrevistas, o perfil dos consumidores de produtos originarios da agricultura organica. Tendo sido observado que nao constituiam um publico com maiores especificidades, mas que tinham na sa{\'u}de pessoal e da familia a grande motivacao para consumo. Finalizando, conclui-se que a pequena producao seria a grande beneficiaria da difusao da agricultura organica, e, que somente atraves da pressao da sociedade organizada sobre o Estado este processo tera sucesso.

Organic raisin production constitutes 1.35\% of the total raisin production of Turkey. The research was carried out in Ala{\c s}ehir-Ye{\c s}ilyurt Enterprise of Viticulture Research Station from 2006 to 2007. The research was established in a 15 year-old ?Sultani {\c C}ekirdeksiz? vineyard under irrigable soil conditions in organic parcel. Three different tillage methods: conventional tillage, mulch tillage, and reduced tillage were applied on the trial parcels. The research was carried out as randomized block design trials with three replicates consisting of 12 vines per parcel. Mineral substance analyses of the raisins obtained from the applications were performed using the ICP-AES technique. It was found that there was highest average potassium (K), calcium (Ca), iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) contents of the raisin in mulch tillage; highest average magnesium (Mg), phosphorus (P) and sodium (Na) contents of the raisin in conventional tillage; highest average manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) contents of the raisin in reduced tillage at 5\% significant level.},

        abstract = {Parasitism is well recognized as a major challenge to the health and welfare of organic livestock. Although previous projects have largely delivered the underpinning scientific research, progress in the implementation of control strategies has been hindered by: i) limitations of research at farm systems level, ii) lack of clear cost-benefit analysis and iii) difficulties in reaching and educate the appropriate stakeholders. The overall objective of this project, which brings together nine academic partners from eight countries, is to generate information and tools that can be readily used by organic farmers to improve animal health and welfare; we aim to achieve this by targeting the interface between research and dissemination. In the UK, organic farmers were given a variety of options to consider for sustainable parasite control on farm. Participating farmers were asked to select one or more of these options, including protein supplementation, drenching on weight loss and bioactive grazing, use it in one group of animals, and then compare the results with another group managed in a ?usual? manner. Drenching animals that lost weight did not appear to be affecting total faecal egg counts (FEC), as these were not necessarily the animals with the highest FEC, whereas protein supplementation around parturition and lactation of twin ewes reduced FEC of these animals.},

        abstract = {Zusammenfassung

Mittelfristig ist in Deutschland mit einem kommerziellen Anbau von gentechnisch ver{\"a}nderten Pflanzen zu rechnen. Durch diese absehbare Entwicklung sind Politik und Landwirtschaft gefordert, dem Verbraucher eine Wahlfreiheit auf dem Markt zu erm{\"o}glichen. Insbesondere die {\"o}kologische Landwirtschaft ist mit den entstehenden Problemen durch einen parallelen GVO-Anbau konfrontiert. Qua Gesetz und auch
durch verbandseigene Richtlinien ist dem {\"O}kolandbau eine Anwendung gentechnisch ver{\"a}nderter Organismen und aus entsprechenden Organismen hergestellter Betriebsmittel untersagt. Dennoch droht {\"u}ber den technologischen oder
den biologischen Weg eine Kontamination mit GVO oder deren Derivaten.
Auf der Basis eines Diskussionspapiers wurden in einem Fachgespr{\"a}ch mit ExpertInnen Forschungs- und Handlungsbedarf, sowie offene Fragen bez{\"u}glich der
GVO-Problematik identifiziert, verschiedene L{\"o}sungsstrategien diskutiert und deren Tauglichkeit und Umsetzbarkeit {\"u}berpr{\"u}ft.
Entlang der gesamten Warenflusskette vom Saatgut bis in den Verarbeitungsbetrieb existieren kritische Punkte einer Vermischung mit GVO oder GVO-Bestandteilen. Ein Teil der Verunreinigungen kann auf dem technischen Weg durch gemeinsam genutzte Maschinen oder Verarbeitungsst{\"a}tten entstehen. Ein anderer Teil wird biologisch bedingt sein, da weder bei der Saatgutproduktion noch w{\"a}hrend des
landwirtschaftlichen Anbaus ein Eintrag von transgenem Pollen oder von Tieren verschleppten Saatguts vollst{\"a}ndig vermieden werden kann. Die gr{\"o}{\ss}tm{\"o}gliche Sicherheit vor technischen Verunreinigungen bieten vollst{\"a}ndig getrennte Warenfl{\"u}sse, die allerdings nur mit hohem Aufwand realisiert werden k{\"o}nnen. Dies w{\"u}rde beispielsweise bedeuten, dass Erntemaschinen, Transportfahrzeuge und
Verarbeitungseinrichtungen ausschlie{\ss}lich mit {\"O}ko-Erzeugnissen beschickt werden.
Biologische Verunreinigungen durch Polleneintrag mit nachfolgender Befruchtung lassen sich nur dann weitestgehend minimieren, wenn {\"u}ber neue oder ver{\"a}nderte
Abstandsregelungen die Wahrscheinlichkeit der Befruchtung mit transgenem Pollen in fremdbefruchteten Arten verhindert oder anderweitig gesenkt wird. Das Problem der Fremdbefruchtung mit anschlie{\ss}end entstehendem transgenen Erntegut wird derzeit bei g{\"a}rtnerischen Kulturen als vergleichsweise klein eingesch{\"a}tzt. Anders sieht die Situation bei den landwirtschaftlichen Kulturen aus. Hier sind alle Akteure gefordert, durch {\"U}bereink{\"u}nfte und Regelungen auch f{\"u}r die Zukunft eine "gentechnikfreie" {\"o}kologische Produktion zu gew{\"a}hrleisten.
W{\"a}hrend des Fachgespr{\"a}chs wurden verschiedene L{\"o}sungsans{\"a}tze diskutiert, die zum Teil bereits in anderen L{\"a}ndern verfolgt werden. Eine M{\"o}glichkeit besteht in der
Ausweisung von Gebieten, in denen ein GVO-Anbau untersagt ist. In {\"O}sterreich wurde diese Strategie insbesondere im Hinblick auf {\"o}kologisch sensible Gebiete gepr{\"u}ft. Die TeilnehmerInnen des Fachgespr{\"a}chs waren sich einig, dass eine solche Strategie juristisch gepr{\"u}ft werden sollte, betonten aber auch, dass die {\"o}kologische Landwirtschaft nicht auf solche zu definierende Gebiete beschr{\"a}nkt werden d{\"u}rfe. 
In Gro{\ss}britannien wird {\"u}ber ver{\"a}nderte Abstandsregelungen debattiert. Bisher wurde in einer Literaturstudie unter der Pr{\"a}misse, dass Verunreinigungen unter einem bestimmten Wert bleiben sollten, die daf{\"u}r notwendigen Abst{\"a}nde f{\"u}r die Kulturen Mais und Raps definiert. Im Fachgespr{\"a}ch herrschte Konsens, dass neben den bereits bestehenden Vorschriften zur Saatgutproduktion auch im normalen Anbau Abstandsregelungen implementiert werden m{\"u}ssten, bei denen das Verursacherprinzip angewendet werden m{\"u}sse, d.h. dass die Abst{\"a}nde auf keinen Fall auf Kosten des {\"o}kologischen Anbaus gehen d{\"u}rften. Ungekl{\"a}rt blieb die Frage, ob ausreichend Kenntnisse f{\"u}r Abstandregelungen f{\"u}r die einzelnen Kulturen vorhanden sind. Zudem kam bei den TeilnehmerInnen der Wunsch auf, die bisher naturwissenschaftlich basierte Technikfolgenabsch{\"a}tzung durch eine sozio{\"o}konomische zu erg{\"a}nzen und hierbei die f{\"u}r eine vollst{\"a}ndig getrennte Landwirtschaft und Lebensmittelproduktion anfallenden volkswirtschaftlichen Kosten zu ermitteln.
Erg{\"a}nzend zu Gebieten ohne GVO-Anbau und Abstandsregelungen wurde die Notwendigkeit von Grenzwerten z.B. aus Haftungsgr{\"u}nden diskutiert. Die Fachgespr{\"a}chsteilnehmerInnen sahen im 1\%-Kennzeichnungsgrenzwert der Novel-Food-Verordung bereits einen De-facto-Grenzwert. Abstandsregelungen und weitere Ma{\ss}nahmen in der Prozesskette m{\"u}ssten garantieren k{\"o}nnen, dass am Ende des Produktionsweges der 1\%-Kennzeichnungsgrenzwert nicht erreicht w{\"u}rde. Die TeilnehmerInnen verwiesen auf die Notwendigkeit einer Analyse der rechtlichen Situation, sehen sie doch die {\"O}kolandwirte diesbez{\"u}glich bisher als v{\"o}llig ungesch{\"u}tzt.
Weitere im Laufe des Fachgespr{\"a}chs ge{\"a}u{\ss}erte Forderungen und W{\"u}nsche an die Politik, der identifizierte Forschungs- und Handlungsbedarf sowie offene Fragen sind am Ende des Berichts stichpunktartig zusammengefasst.},

In the wetter parts of the country, especially in the southwest, there were a few large, mostly government-owned commercial dairy farms on which exotic and cross-bred dairy cattle were kept in paddocks and grazed on improved or natural pastures. In the drier eastern and northeastern parts of the country, pastoralists kept large numbers of local cattle breeds, notably the Small East African Zebu (SEAZ), under traditional extensive management systems. Although the pastoralists marketed some milk, most was consumed by the household. Cattle were also valued as an expression of cultural prestige and a means of accumulating capital and meeting planned and emergency expenses. Smallholders, who tended to keep a few low yielding indigenous cattle as well as growing crops, made little contribution to the nation?s marketed milk and were primarily subsistence-oriented.}

Some studies have investigated this question, but they have missed a critical ecological phenomenon by not considering the role that nitrogen (N) cycling plays in sustaining food production in organic systems. Using a global spatial N cycling model, we show that a 100\% conversion to organic agriculture would lead to a large gap in global food production compared to the current ? i.e. non-organic situation. Organic food availability would thus not be sufficient to match global food demand. We also show that lower conversion shares would be feasible in coexistence with conventional farming when coupled with demand-side solutions, such as reduction of the per-capita energy intake or food wastage. These results are critical to explore the option space of the global food system in a sound and systemic manner.}

        abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the performance of Holstein and Montbeliarde dairy cows in a mixed crop dairy system and in a more restricted one, a 100\% grazing system and. The total dataset contained data from 970 lactations of cows living in an experimental farm (Mirecourt, France) from 2004 to 2015. Over 44 weeks of lactation, Holstein cows produced more milk (+ 531 kg) and fat and proteins (+ 46 kg) than Montbeliarde cows, which represents a higher milk yield per body weight (+1.04 kg / kg of body weight). However, Holstein cows had poorer reproduction performances mainly in the grazing system (- 25 \% of gestation rate) and they decreased to a larger extent their body weight and condition in early lactation. Holstein cows had more reproductive disorders, but Montbeliarde cows faced more lameness. On the whole, cows had more health disorders in the grazing system. Longevity between the two breed was not different because of the choice to keep more frequently Holstein cows in a prolonged lactation. Four profiles of cows were identified in terms of lactation, reproduction, body condition and health, but this classification couldn?t be predicted by their breed, their parity or their feeding constrains.},

        abstract = {Organic farming is a major global movement that is changing land use and consumer habits around the world. This book tells the untold story of how the organic farming movement nearly faltered after an initial flurry of scientific interest and popular support. Drawing on newly unearthed archives, Barton argues that organic farming first gained popularity in an imperial milieu before shifting to the left of the political spectrum after decolonization and serving as a crucial middle stage of environmentalism. Modern organic protocols developed in British India under the guidance of Sir Albert Howard before spreading throughout parts of the British Empire, Europe, and the United States through the advocacy of his many followers and his second wife Louise. Organic farming advocates before and during the Second World War challenged the industrialization of agriculture and its reliance on chemical fertilizers. They came tantalizingly close to influencing government policy. The decolonization of the British Empire, the success of industrial agriculture, and the purging of holistic ideas from medicine sidelined organic farming advocates who were viewed increasingly as cranks and kooks. Organic farming advocates continued to spread their anti-chemical farming message through a small community that deeply influenced Rachel Carson?s ideas in Silent Spring, a book that helped to legitimize anti-chemical concerns. The organic farming movement re-entered the scientific mainstream in the 1980s only with the reluctant backing of government policy. It has continued to grow in popularity ever since and continues to inspire those who seek to align agriculture and health.},

A few statements made by Howard himself, and by his second wife, Louise, inspired the myth of peasant origins of organic wisdom.

Det har blitt tatt ut jordpr{\o}ver for analyse seks ganger med fem til syv {\r a}rs mellomrom i l{\o}pet av 30-{\r a}rsperioden. Engavlinger har blitt registrert p{\r a} en del av de fulldyrka {\o}kologiske skiftene siden 1991. Samtidig med avlingsregistreringene har pr{\o}ver blitt tatt og analysert for n{\ae}ringsinnhold. Fra 2008 ble det ogs{\r a} tatt ut pr{\o}ver for {\r a} bestemme andelen gras, belgvekster og ugras i forbindelse med avlingsregistreringene. F{\o}r Tingvoll gard fikk klimastasjon i 1995, ble nedb{\o}r og temperatur hentet fra en klimastasjon som l{\r a} 15 km lenger inn i landet. {\r A}rlige n{\ae}ringsbalanser for nitrogen, fosfor og kalium har blitt beregnet p{\r a} bakgrunn av mengder innkj{\o}pte og solgte produkter i gardsregnskapene. 
Innholdet av mold og plantetilgjengelig fosfor (P-AL), kalsium og magnesium i matjordlaget for garden sett under ett er redusert i l{\o}pet av perioden 1991-2021. Innholdet av fosfor (P-AL) kategoriseres likevel som ?godt? i fulldyrka jord i 2021. P{\r a} de permanente beitene var P-AL-innholdet karakterisert som ?middels/optimalt?, som er {\o}nskelig niv{\r a}. Plantetilgjengelig kalium har {\o}kt litt i perioden. Kaliumreservene har vist en nedgang, men er likevel store. N{\ae}rings- og moldinnholdet i undergrunnsjorda, 20-40 cm dybde, p{\r a} fulldyrka arealer har v{\ae}rt stabilt over tid. 
Gjennomsnittstemperaturen i vekstsesongen har {\o}kt med ca. 0,05 o C {\r a}rlig i l{\o}pet av 30-{\r a}rs perioden. Dette har f{\o}rt til tidligere h{\o}sting av enga og ofte tre sl{\r a}tter istedenfor to. Engavlingene fra f{\o}rste sl{\r a}tt har blitt litt redusert fra 1991 til 2021, men innholdet av r{\r a}protein, PBV og AAT har hatt en svak {\o}kning som tyder p{\r a} tidligere h{\o}sting. Andelen belgvekster har variert fra 15 til 50 \% i {\r a}rene fra 2008 til 2021, og har v{\ae}rt h{\o}yere i andresl{\r a}tten enn i f{\o}rstesl{\r a}tten. Denne andelen har holdt seg bra helt til femte eng{\r a}r. 
N{\ae}ringsbalansen viser at det har v{\ae}rt litt h{\o}yere overskudd av nitrogen, fosfor og kalium de siste {\r a}rene. {\r A}rsaken er st{\o}rre mengde innkj{\o}pt kraftf{\^o}r og noe grovf{\^o}r etter 2010 enn f{\o}r.

        abstract = {Description of the subject. Many decision support tools (DSTs) have been developed to help dairy farmers optimally manage the high variability in the quality and availability of grass-based fodder, but their adoption rate remains low.

Objectives. The objective was to characterize and understand the adoption rate of DSTs related to using grass-based fodder.

Methodology. A sample of 61 Walloon (Belgium) dairy farmers responded to an online survey concerning their current use of 23 DSTs related to using grass-based fodder either directly (pasture or grassland) or indirectly (feeding or techno-economic), as well as barriers to and incentives for adopting them, their current interest in DSTs, and satisfaction with the guidance on using these DSTs.

Results. Pasture management DSTs were used the least, even though farmers were the most interested in them. Farmers used simple indicators rather than software or automated tools. Farmers indicated that DSTs were too expensive and time consuming, even if they could ultimately save them time and money. Continuing education is lacking. Four types of users were identified who influence the use of DSTs: high user no grazing (H-NG), high user traditional or technical grazing (H-T/TG), low user traditional grazing (L-TG), and moderate user organic (M-ORG).

Conclusions. Communicating with end-users during each step of DST development would help (1) identify the specific needs of a diverse set of dairy farmers and (2) develop DSTs that better correspond to their practices. More long-term guidance is required to inform farmers about existing DSTs and to transfer the knowledge required to use them.},

The place of livestock appears to be central to the debate, particularly because of the role it should play in cropping systems to close mineral cycles and control diseases, weeds and pests. However, its feed efficiency is low. In the end, it appears that the place of livestock in systems based on the principles of agro-ecology and particularly in organic farming will be determined by its ability to use fodder resources from cropping systems or permanent grasslands on the one hand, and resources from crops that cannot be used by humans on the other. The optimum importance of livestock in farming system and territories will therefore depend on each context but should lead to maximizing food production for populations},

We surveyed 95 organic multi-species livestock farms across six European countries to build a farm typology and characterise their diversity in structure, management, and performances. Farms combined cattle (meat, milk), small ruminants (meat, milk) and/or monogastrics. Survey data on the structure, management, and performances allowed for the creation of indicators (including farmer?s satisfaction) used to run a principal component analysis and an agglomerative hierarchical clustering to build the farm typology. The following variables structured the first four factors of the PCA: F1: Farm size and crop-pasture balance; F2: Intensification - Feed self-sufficiency; F3: Work productivity - Diversification activities and marketing; F4: Dairy cattle and permanent pasture. Four groups of farms emerged from the clustering: G1: Large area with a high share of crops, low feed autonomy, dairy cattle with beef cattle or pigs, on-farm processing, short sale channels and agritourism; G2: Prevalence of poultry with beef cattle, leading to high labour productivity and low feed autonomy, although ruminant diets highly rely (90\%) on fodder; G3: Beef cattle associated with meat sheep, high feed autonomy, frequent short sale channels; G4: Italian farms with predominantly dairy ewes and dairy or meat cattle, rangelands, on-farm processing and short sale channels. Our next objective is to study the relationships between agricultural practices, work organisation, sales management and farm performances.},

Here, we associated sheep with beef cattle (40?60\% livestock units (LU)) in a mixed system (MIXsys) and compared its performances to those of a specialised beef cattle-only system (CATsys) and a specialised sheep-only system (SHsys). All three systems were designed to have identical annual stocking rates and similar farm areas, pastures and animals. The experiment was conducted for
four campaigns (2017?2020) in an upland setting exclusively on permanent grassland under certifiedorganic farming standards. The young animals were fattened almost exclusively with forages: at pasture for lambs and indoors with haylage in winter for young cattle. Abnormally dry weather conditions led to hay purchases. We compared between-system and between-enterprise performances based on technical, economic (gross product, expenses, margins, income), environmental (greenhouse gas emissions (GHG),
energy consumption) and feed?food competition balance indicators. The mixed-species association only benefited the sheep enterprise, with +17.1\% meat production per LU (P {\ensuremath{<}} 0.03), ?17.8\% concentrate used per LU (P {\ensuremath{<}} 0.02), +10.0\% gross margin (P {\ensuremath{<}} 0.07) and +47.5\% income per LU (P {\ensuremath{<}} 0.03) in MIXsys vs SHsys, as well as environmental performance benefits via a reduction of 10.9\% in GHG emissions (P {\ensuremath{<}} 0.09) and 15.7\% in energy consumption (P {\ensuremath{<}} 0.03), and a 47.2\% improvement in feed?food competition (P {\ensuremath{<}} 0.01) in
MIXsys vs SHsys. These results are due to both better animal performance and lower concentrate consumption in MIXsys, as presented in a companion paper. These benefits outweighed the additional costs of the mixed system, especially for fencing, in terms of net income per sheep LU. There were no betweensystem differences in productive and economic performance (kilos live-weight produced, kilos concentrate used and income per LU) for the beef cattle enterprise. Despite good animal performances, the beef cattle enterprises in both CATsys and MIXsys had poor economic performance due to large purchases of conserved forages and difficulty selling the animals, which were ill-adapted to the traditional downstream sector. This multiyear study at the farming-system level, which has thus far been underresearched for mixed livestock farming systems, highlighted and quantified the benefits for sheep when combined with beef cattle on economic, environmental, and feed?food competition performance.},

        abstract = {Organic farming is considered an effective mean of reducing nitrogen losses compared with more intensive conventional farming systems. However, under certain conditions organic farming may also be susceptible to high nitrogen (N) losses. This is especially the case for organic dairy farms on sandy soils that use grazed grass-clover in rotation with cereals, which may lead to high rates of nitrate leaching. 
A study was conducted on two commercial organic farms on sand and loamy sand soils. On each farm a three year old grass-clover field was selected. Half of the field was ploughed the first year and the other half was ploughed the next year. Spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was sown after the spring ploughing. Measurements showed a low N leaching during the pasture period (9-64 kg N ha-1) but a high leaching the first (63-216 kg N ha-1) and second (61-235 kg N ha-1) year after ploughing. In addition, a high residual N effect of the pasture was observed on the barley yields in both years. There was thus a low response to manure application on the sandy soil both during the first and second year after ploughing. 
To study the underlying processes affecting the residual effects of the pasture and the N leaching, the dynamic whole farm model FASSET was used to simulate all the treatments on both farms. The simulations agreed with the observed barley yields. However, for the sandy soil the simulation of nitrate leaching and mineral nitrogen in the soil deviated from the measurements. Three scenarios with changes in model parameters were constructed to investigate this discrepancy. These scenarios suggested that the organic matter turnover model should include a pool with a half-life of about 2-3 years.  There may also be a need to include effects of soil disturbance (tillage) on soil organic matter turnover.

        abstract = {Med udgangspunkt i regnskabsdata fra F{\o}devare{\o}konomisk Institut (F{\O}I) og data fra Centrale Registre (CR) blev importen af kv{\ae}lstof (N) i g{\o}dning til marken til konventionelle og {\o}kologiske planteavlere estimeret til hhv. 129 og 51 kg N ha-1 {\r a}r-1. Desuden blev der med udgangspunkt i den aktuelle afgr{\o}defordeling opstillet et generelt s{\ae}dskifte for hver af de to systemer. Det opstillede s{\ae}dskifte for den {\o}kologiske planteavl havde en h{\o}j andel af v{\r a}rs{\ae}d og desuden 20\% kl{\o}vergr{\ae}s, mens den konventionelle planteavl var domineret af kornafgr{\o}der prim{\ae}rt i form af vinters{\ae}d. Med baggrund i disse model-s{\ae}dskifter blev N-balancen p{\r a} markniveau beregnet ved anvendelse af FASSET modellen. Dette inkluderede ogs{\r a} N-udvaskning og {\ae}ndring i jordens Npulje. Alle beregninger blev foretaget for tre jordtyper, der repr{\ae}senterer variationen i danske jordtyper. Disse tre jordtyper blev ydermere delt op i lav og h{\o}j frugtbarhed, repr{\ae}senteret ved et lavt og h{\o}jt indhold af organisk N i jorden. Modelresultaterne viste, at den {\o}kologiske planteavl havde en h{\o}jere markbalance end den konventionelle planteavl (61 mod 40 kg N ha-1 {\r a}r-1). Men da indbygningen i jordens N-pulje samtidig var h{\o}jere for de {\o}kologiske brug, gav dette ikke anledning til forskelle i niveauet for udvaskning (36 kg N ha-1 {\r a}r-1 for begge). De {\o}kologiske bedrifter {\o}gede deres jordfrugtbarhed ved {\r a}rligt i gennemsnit at indbygge 13 kg N ha-1 i jorden, mens de konventionelle reducerede frugtbarheden ved i gennemsnit at t{\ae}re 6 kg N ha-1 {\r a}r-1 p{\r a} jordens indhold af organisk N. Dette kan prim{\ae}rt till{\ae}gges forskelle i afgr{\o}devalg. Desuden blev en r{\ae}kke driftsm{\ae}ssige tiltag analyseret, herunder efterafgr{\o}der, halmnedmuldning, reduceret g{\o}dningstilf{\o}rsel og {\ae}ndringer i s{\ae}dskiftet. Disse analyser viste, at etablering af efterafgr{\o}der er det klart mest effektive virkemiddel til at reducere N-udvaskningen, med en effekt p{\r a} s{\ae}dskifteniveau p{\r a} ca. 9 kg N ha-1 {\r a}r-1. Det fulde potentiale ved dyrkning af efterafgr{\o}der vil dog ikke kunne udnyttes i praksis, da der af hensyn til bek{\ae}mpelse af is{\ae}r rodukrudt, er n{\o}dvendigt med en stubbearbejdning i efter{\r a}ret, der kan give anledning til en betydelig {\o}get N-udvaskning. Andre tiltag, som f.eks. halmnedmuldning, havde mindre effekt p{\r a} N-udvaskningen, men en markant effekt p{\r a} jordens indhold af organisk N. S{\r a}ledes {\o}gede halmnedmuldningen ved den {\o}kologiske planteavl jordens indhold af organisk N med 14 kg N ha-1 {\r a}r-1 mere end i basis-scenariet. P{\r a} basis af simuleringerne blev det konkluderet at der ikke er nogen forskel i udvaskningsniveauet mellem {\o}kologisk og konventionel planteavl. Da N-udvaskningen fra konventionel planteavl blev simuleret at v{\ae}re faldet 4 kg N ha-1 {\r a}r-1 som f{\o}lge af implementeringen af VMP II blev det vurderet, at der har v{\ae}ret ca. 4 kg N ha-1 {\r a}r-1 mere N-udvaskning fra konventionel planteproduktion i forhold til niveauet for {\o}kologisk planteavl f{\o}r VMP II. }

Beregningerne viste, at p{\r a} et udsnit af typiske danske jorde var udvaskningen fra b{\r a}de {\o}kologiske og konventionelle planteavlere ca. 36 kg N/ha. Forskellen mellem {\o}kologisk og konventionel planteavl kom dog til udtryk i {\ae}ndringer i organisk stof i jorden. Mens {\o}kologerne opbyggede ca. 13 kg N/ha om {\r a}ret, t{\ae}rede de konventionelle ca. 6 kg N/ha om {\r a}ret p{\r a} jordens organiske stof.  

Modellen blev yderligere brugt til at gennemregne effekten af forskellig driftspraksis. Anvendelse af efterafgr{\o}der var klart det mest effektive virkemiddel til at reducere kv{\ae}lstofudvaskningen. I gennemsnit over et helt s{\ae}dskifte blev udvaskningen s{\r a}ledes reduceret med ca. 9 kg N/ha. Det svarede til en reduktion p{\r a} ca. 30 kg N/ha i de marker, hvor der i det p{\r a}g{\ae}ldende {\r a}r kunne bruges en efterafgr{\o}de. En reduktion i importen af husdyrg{\o}dning, vil derimod h{\o}jest reducere N udvaskningen med 2-4 kg N/ha ved de forholdsvist lave N niveauer, der bruges hos de {\o}kologiske planteavlere. Halmnedmuldning betyder heller ikke ret meget for kv{\ae}lstofudvaskningen, mens jordens frugtbarhed stiger betragteligt i forhold til en situation, hvor man fjerner halmen.

        abstract = {To contribute to the discussion on the con-ventionalisation hypothesis, empirical data on mo-tives for the conversion to organic farming by recent adopters is analysed. The results indicate that the preferences and attitudes of the new organic farmers contradict the conventionalisation scenario: (1) Com-pared to conventional farmers, the new adopters have lower preferences for high yields, market prices and easy control of weed and pests, but higher prefer-ences for receiving subsidies and not using chemicals. (2) Environmental concern has an effect on the odds of an adoption of organic farming. Thus, new organic farmers significantly differ in their preferences and attitudes from conventional farmers ? they hold a less productivist, relatively alternative view of farming. In a conventionalised organic agriculture we would not expect to observe these differences.}

In this abstract we present the project activities and the first experiences from the farmers. The so-called ?silvopastoral? systems (= combination of trees and animals) are applied traditionally already long times in Africa and Mediterranean countries.

        abstract = {From 2007?2008, data on animal health and welfare and farm management during rearing and laying periods were collected from 49 flocks of organic laying hens in the Netherlands. Our aim was to investigate how organic egg farms performed in terms of animal health and welfare and which farm factors affected this performance. The flocks in our study were kept on farms with 34 to 25,000 hens (average 9,300 hens). Seventy-one percent of the flocks consisted of ?silver hybrids?: white hens that lay brown eggs. Fifty-five percent of the flocks were kept in floor-based housing and 45\% of the flocks in aviaries. No relation was found between the amount of time spent outdoors during the laying period and mortality at 60 weeks. Flocks that used their outdoor run more intensively had better feather scores. In 40\% of the flocks there was mortality caused by predators. The average feed intake was 129 g/day at 30 weeks and 133 g/day at 60 weeks of age. The average percentage of mislaid eggs decreased from three at 30 weeks to two at 60 weeks. The average mortality was 7.8\% at 60 weeks. Twenty-five percent of the flocks were not treated for worms in their first 50 weeks. Flubenol{\copyright} was applied to the flocks that were treated. Ten percent of the flocks followed Flubenol{\copyright} instructions for use and were wormed five or more times. The other 65\% percent were treated irregularly between one and four times. Sixty-eight percent of the flocks showed little or no feather damage, 24\% showed moderate damage and 8\% showed severe damage. The feather score was better if the hens used the free-range area more intensely, the laying percentage at 60 weeks was higher, and if they were allowed to go outside sooner after arrival on the laying farm. In 69\% of the flocks, hens had peck wounds in the vent area: on average this was 18\% of the hens. Keel bone deformations were found in all flocks, on average in 21\% of the birds. In 78\% of the flocks, an average of 13\% of the hens had foot-sole wounds, mostly a small crust. Combs were darker in flocks that used the range area more intensively. More fearful flocks had lighter combs. We conclude that organic farms are potentially more animal friendly than other poultry systems based on the animal welfare benefits of the free range areas. However, we also observed mortality rates, internal parasites, keel bone deformities, and foot sole lesions on organic farms that were comparable to or worse than in other husbandry systems. It is unclear whether these ?remaining? problems can be attributed to housing or if they are the result of keeping high productive genotypes in an artificial environment. Organic farms use the same high productive genotypes as other husbandry systems. },

After the mating and when the females started nesting, a metal grid was installed in front of the nest to oblige the females to get out passing through the dispenser. A free space above the dispenser gave female bees the possibility of returning to their nest without crossing the dispenser. Although some time was needed to learn how to enter the nest using the free space above the dispenser, it ended up being successful. Exiting and passing the dispenser did not result in any hindrance. This experiment shows that successful nesting activity and a good dispersion of microbial control agent can be obtained with the use of solitary bees.},

Thus, the objective of this study was to compare, in a dystrophic Ultisol, the effects of organic and conventional agricultures on soil organism populations, for the tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum) and corn (Zea mays) crops. In general, it was found that fungus, bacterium and actinomycet populations counted by the number of colonies in the media, were similar for the two cropping systems. CO2 evolution during the cropping season was higher, up to the double for the organic agriculture system as compared to the conventional. The number of earthworms was about ten times higher in the organic system. There was no difference in the decomposition rate of organic matter of the two systems. In general, the number of microartropods was always higher in the organic plots in relation to the conventional ones, reflectining on the Shannon index diversity. The higher insect population belonged to the Collembola order, and in the case of mites, to the superfamily Oribatuloidea. Individuals of the groups Aranae, Chilopoda, Dyplopoda, Pauropoda, Protura and Symphyla were occasionally collected in similar number in both cropping systems. },

The objective of this paper was comparing both organic (OS) and conventional (CS) tomato cropping systems for varieties D{\'e}bora and Santa Clara, through an interdisciplinary study. The experiment was set up in a randomized blocks design with six replicates, in a dystrophic Ultisol plots measuring 25 ? 17 m. Cropping procedures followed by either local conventional or organic growers practices recommendations. Fertilization in the OS was done with organic compost, single superphosphate, dolomitic limes (5L, 60 g, and 60 g per pit), and sprayed twice a week with biofertilizer. Fertilization in the CS was done with 200 g 4-14-8 (NPK) per pit and, after planting, 30 g N, 33 g K and 10.5 g P per pit; from 52 days after planting forth, plants were sprayed once a week with foliar fertilizer. In the CS, a blend of insecticides, fungicides and miticides was sprayed twice a week, after planting. In the OS, extracts of black pepper, garlic, and Eucalyptus; Bordeaux mixture, and biofertilizer, were applied twice a week to control diseases and pests. Tomato spotted wilt was the most important disease in the OS, resulting in smaller plant development, number of flower clusters and yield. In the CS, the disease was kept under control, and the population of thrips, the virus vector, occurred at lower levels than in the OS. Variety Santa Clara presented greater incidence of the viral disease, and for this reason had a poorer performance than 'D{\'e}bora', especially in the OS. Occurrence of Liriomyza spp. was significantly smaller in the OS, possibly because of the greater frequency of Chrysoperla. The CS had smaller incidence of leaf spots caused by Septoria lycopersici and Xanthomonas vesicatoria. However, early blight and fruit rot caused by Alternaria solani occurred in larger numbers. No differences were observed with regard to the communities of fungi and bacteria in the phylloplane, and to the occurrence of weeds. },

The rural-urban interface in the Kathmandu Valley is an important vegetable production pocket which supplies a large amount of the vegetables in the city core. While subsistence farming in the rural area is characterized by a system which integrates livestock and forestry with agriculture, the intensification in the urban fringe is characterized by triple crop rotations and market-oriented intensive vegetable production. Seven factors which were supposed to cause farming variation in the interface were incorporated in the AHP framework and then subjected to the farmers? judgment in distinctly delineated three farming zones. These factors played crucial yet differing roles in different farming zones. Inaccessibility and use of local resources; higher yield and accessibility and agro-ecological consideration and quality production are the key impacting factors of subsistence, commercial inorganic and smallholder organic farming respectively. The quantification of such factors of farming differentiation through AHP is an important piece of information that will contribute in modeling farming in the rural-urban interface of developing countries which are characterized by a high diversity of farming practices and are undergoing a rapid 
change in the land use pattern.},

Many socio-economic variables have strong spatial relations that would otherwise be missed by data aggregation at household level.

Present article aims at integrating socio-economic data into GIS environment to examine spatial relation in the resource availability and use employing spatial and random sampling techniques. Result demonstrates the variation in the socioeconomic attributes along the spatial gradient which is mainly related to the infrastructures such as road, market and improved agro-inputs. While households with better access to these infrastructures have tendency to use more agro-chemicals, have larger family, land holding and livestock units, better off-farm opportunities, commercial farming orientation and hence higher family income; opposite is true for the households with poor access to these infrastructures. Peri-urban farmlands, wherever agro-chemicals are applied imprudently, faces the problems of agro-ecological degradation while rural subsistence farming faces the problem of spatial poverty.}

While hills suffer from erosion because they are erodible, the peri-urban areas face the problem of decline in factor productivity, particularly in intensively cultivated farmlands. The present study is concerned with simulating farm income on a regional scale based on soil management practices. Spatial explicit simulation shows that the loss of farm income due to degradation is substantially higher in hills while it is lower in valley bottoms. Strategy formulation and testing in the spatial environment indicates that Geographic Information System is an appropriate methodological tool for simulating the consequences of particular interventions.}

Improvement of conditions during slaughter are essential to ensure good animal welfare.We identified potential problem areas through guided interviews with slaughterhouse employees and a situation analysis at a Swiss cattle slaughterhouse. After implementation of improvement measures, data from 503 cattle slaughtered in August 2017 were evaluated with regard to the stress-indicating parameters cortisol content in exsanguination blood and proportion of vocalizing animals compared to data of a former study in 2012.The mean cortisol content (3.50 ug/dl) was uncritical and significantly influenced by the driving person and the day. Whereas the high proportion of vocalizing animals of 19.1\% was critical. The behaviour of the driving person was also decisive here.We conclude that employee training is the key to further reducing stress-inducing situations during slaughter.},

We evaluated the shade effect on the roots and shoots development for two float systems surgeries (CV:conventional and ORG:organic) on melon transplants. The shade had differently influenced the development of the roots and shoots of the two float systems surgeries. Roots fresh weight and surface was significant higher under shade for organic transplants and significant lower under shade for conventional transplants. Hence, shoots fresh weight and surface was significant higher under shade for organic as well as conventional transplants. Because of the described differences in roots development, the transplants which were produced in the organic float system nursery had better quality under shade in contrast to those produced in conventional float system nursery which had better quality under light. The quality of transplants is related to their behaviour during the transplanting process, their resistance to the transplanting stress and their survival in the field.},

The ability to capture this resource in organic systems calls for appropriate techniques. Kenya experiences bimodal type of rainfall with two rainfall peaks; the long (730 mm) and the short (376 mm) rains. Rainfall fluctuations in both seasons are becoming more common in the recent years with a likelihood of crop failure in one out of five years. The question addressed was how to utilize the short rains for food and biomass production. Lablab (Dolichos lablab), a N-fixing legume was sown in the short rains and the seeds harvested. The effect of lablab biomass incorporation on organic maize and potatoes planted in the long rains was evaluated in comparison with farmyard manure application. The 3-year trial showed that dry matter biomass (1.95 t/ha) and grain yield (0.5 t/ha) of lablab was a factor of the amount of rainfall. The amount of lablab biomass applied was proportional to maize grain and potato tuber yields. Similarly, amount of yield and biomass in the long rains was species specific and were a factor of both rainfall amounts and distribution.},

Earthworm aspects of organic farming are twofold: ?waste? recycling through compost worms and soil enhancement from endemic field worms.  Bio-physico-chemical benefits from sustained earthworm activity accrue for biodiversity, soil organic matter (SOM = worm-worked humus) derived from carbon sequestration of atmospheric CO2 via photosynthesis/humification and nitrogen N2 fixation from microbes rather than synthetic Haber-Bosch urea, plus greatly improved infiltration and soil-water-storage.

Just as earthworm burrows filter all rainwater, all atmospheric carbon from leaf litter/roots is processed through their intestines in 12 yr cycles as they build topsoil.  Earth?s total soil data are not readily available, but flat-surface estimates with ranges of 2,400-6,020 Gt of topsoil humus are newly recalculated herein as 10,800-27,090 Gt containing 6,264-15,712 Gt SOC with a median value {\ensuremath{>}}10,000 Gt global soil carbon.  Carbon restoration in this humus resource alone has potential for rapid reduction of Mauna Loa?s 400 ppm atmospheric CO2 by {\texttt{\char126}}100 ppm, i.e., to pre-industrial levels. 

This review highlights that organic husbandry ? with earthworms at its core ? offsets CO2 emissions (remediation) while moisture, pH, and soil temperatures simultaneously improve, increasing crop resilience and biodiversity (mitigation \& adaptation).  Earthworms naturally monitor \& maintain healthy soils thereby solving human-generated climate \& critical species extinction problems at both local \& global scale.  Such important considerations support 2015 Paris COP21 ?Climate Change Policy? agenda \& international ?4/1000 Initiative: Soils for Food Security \& Climate?.}

Soil moisture differences ranged -11?41\% (mean +12.0\%) while soil carbon in SOM humus ranged 26?128\% (mean +64.9\%).  Correlation (r {\ensuremath{>}}0.835) of earthworms is with crop yield and both soil H2O \& C storage hence atmospheric CO2 reduction via photosynthesis / humification.

A 1,000 yr-old pasture at Haughley had highest earthworms (424 m-2), stored 222 t ha-1 carbon in its soil organic matter (SOM), plus moisture capacity was 90.9\% above an adjacent arable field.

Relating to global climate change, extrapolation to areas given over to each of the three crops if all organically converted gives CO2 equivalents (CO2e) of 49.2, 2.8 and 1.1 Gt (total 53.1 Gt) C storage for wheat, rice and sugarcane, respectively.  Wheat alone, albeit projected, exceeds global emission ({\texttt{\char126}}40 Gt CO2); rice matches Eurozone?s (2.5 Gt); and sugarcane either Japan (1.2 Gt) or UK + Australia combined (0.5 + 0.4 Gt).  Extra carbon stored (53.1 Gt CO2e) would equal {\texttt{\char126}}7.3 ppm atmospheric CO2 reduction.  Pasture management offers yet greater potential remedy, here calculated as optimal 222 t ha-1 x 3.6 Gha total grass = 800 Gt C (x 3.667 conversion factor = 2,934 Gt CO2e) about equal to present atmospheric values of 3,000 Gt CO2 and 400 ppm.

This project looked to protect the region?s biodiversity and to contribute to mitigate the negative environmental effects through the implementation of organic coffee production systems, integrating ecological, social and economic factors to offer sustainable and profitable production alternatives. Six components were looked at: associated crops, establishment of shade trees and windbreaks, fertilization, studies of bird diversity and improved coffee processing systems.

As this may also implicitly affect production economics and risk potential, the paper at hand evaluates two year crop-rotations from empiric field data, considering costs and revenues of production as well as yield effects based on stochastic risk simulation. Absolute profitability as well as risk potential substantially varies between cropping systems and locations and does not necessarily display a definite preference of conventional/reduced tillage or subsidiary cropping systems. However, a temporal expansion of the period under observation considering long-term effects of soil fertility enhancing management practices may illustrate their risk-reducing potential as well as the necessity to handle them as long-term investments with instant expenses and subsequent economic returns.},

On extensive or semi-natural grassland sites, the profitability of grassland utilisation with customary processing procedures like dairy or suckler cow farming is often realized insufficiently, however. As the global demand for sustainable energy supplies increases, the newly developed IFBB-technique (Integrated Generation of Solid Fuel and Biogas from Biomass) could exhibit an alternative grassland utilisation by using plant cover from extensive grasslands for the generation of renewable energies whilst preserving valuable grassland habitats, without competing against land for food production. A survey amongst farmers in the low mountain range of Vogelsberg, Germany, identified general frameworks of extensive grassland management as well as incentives and objections for an implementation of the IFBB technology at single farm level. Calculations of processing values of grassland in different procedures of animal husbandry, landscape maintenance and bio-energy production indicate that the utilisation of extensively managed grassland in alternative bio-energy systems could exhibit the most favourable land use option for organic semi-natural grassland management. These results are verified by a risk modelling approach.}

This can be contrasted with conventional agriculture, which is said to marginalise women. To understand gender dynamics in organic farming, 111 men and 69 women registered organic farmers were studied using a semi-structured interview schedule and on-farm observations in the context of livestock production activities during 2006-07 in the North Indian state of Uttarakhand, which has embraced organic agriculture by declaring itself as first organic state in India. Land and livestock ownership was mostly with men, whereas income was jointly managed by both men and women followed by women members alone in most of the households. Animal husbandry activities were performed by both men and women, followed by women members of the family, whereas, decision making in animal husbandry activities though reflected plurality, the final decisions in most of the cases rested with men only. This study was not designed to compare the gender dimensions in conventional/traditional farms against organic farms, yet it was observed that women's formal involvement was being encouraged through appropriate policy interventions in the state of Uttarakhand. In particular, the gender sensitisation training imparted by the Uttarakhand Organic Commodity Board (UOCB) appeared to have played key role in making women's participation more proactive and visible. The authors recommend that studies should made to compare the conventional and organic agricultural systems along gender dimensions so as to know to what extent organic agriculture is helping in achieving the millennium goal of gender equality and women's empowerment.}

Hence, to document their livestock production practices, a total of 180 registered organic farmers selected through multistage sampling technique studied during 2006-07. Cent percent of registered organic farmers were involved in mixed farming enterprises and most of them were with more than one livestock species (farm diversity). The breeds maintained by these farmers were of indigenous and they were raising livestock on the inputs met on farm and from the farms of similar agro-ecological regions. In view of the raising demand for organic livestock products locally as well as internationally, the organic promoting agencies have to focus on orienting these farmers towards stringent organic livestock standards so as to enable them to meet the organic livestock products demand locally as well as internationally. }

A total of 94 statements resulted after edition of 102 statements as per the criteria suggested by Edwards (1969), and were sent to 101 extension specialists working in various Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) and State Agriculture and Veterinary Universities throughout India for the critical evaluation of statements on a 3 point continuum. Of the responses received from 50 out of 101 judges, a total of 47 statements were selected basing on relevancy weightage, percentage and mean relevancy scores, and these were subjected to item analysis by administering to 60 farmers from a non-sample area. A total of 21 statements were selected based on the?t? values (above 2.75) resulted from the item analysis and included in the final scale. Thus, the instrument developed to measure attitude of farmers towards organic livestock farming consists of 13 positive and 8 negative attitude statements representing the various areas of organic animal husbandry standards (NSOP, 2000) viz. sustainability, ecology, environment,  animal health and welfare, animal production, certification, quality of organic  products including philosophical and ideological views of organic farmers. },

The conventional farms were less affected than the organic ones, and the farmers developed varied strategies including a reduction of the LU and the use of more maize. To maintain the stability of the milk production, organic farms had to increase the reliance on external fodder resources. The lack of security forage stores can explain the sensitivity of these farms and their incapacity to recover a good level of self-sufficiency.},

Os experimentos foram instalados em Votuporanga, SP, e Selv{\'i}ria, MS, em mar{\c c}o de 2008, ap{\'o}s o preparo convencional do solo.

Por fim, este artigo conclui que a defesa da agroecologia no MST, baseada em um discurso chayanoviano, est{\'a} em curva ascendente, em contraponto ao discurso antes vigente de coletiviza{\c c}{\~a}o e fomento de grandes unidades de explora{\c c}{\~a}o agr{\'i}cola especializadas de inspira{\c c}{\~a}o no marxismo ortodoxo.

Calculations have been performed for model farms, designed on the basis of current organic and conventional farming practices. Energy use and greenhouse gas emissions per hectare on organic farms are lower than on conventional farms, particularly in dairy farming. Energy use and greenhouse gas emissions per Mg of milk in organic dairy farming is about 80 and 90\%, respectively of that in conventional dairy farming. Energy use and greenhouse gas emission per Mg product in organic crop production is 5-40 and 7-17\%, respectively higher than in conventional systems. The wide ranges found in crop production reflect large differences among individual crops.}

        abstract = {The European Union (EU) has a target to reduce emissions by at least 40 per cent by 2030. This is an economy-wide target and therefore includes the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector. The EU is currently consulting stakeholders on how to integrate LULUCF into the EU?s 2030 Climate and Energy Framework. 
The LULUCF sector has several particularities and differs from energy, industrial processes, waste and agriculture (non-CO2) emissions in a number of ways.2 Adequate rules are therefore essential to reflect the changes in LULUCF and to assess progress towards targets. The most specific particularity is that the sector includes activities that cause emissions but also can lead to carbon being taken up and stored (e.g. through biomass accumulation), referred to in this report as a ?removals?, though the removal is not permanent. Currently LULUCF is a net sink in the EU, i.e. it removes more carbon than it releases, though this sink is projected to decline by 2030. Another particularity is that not all emissions and removals are directly human-induced. This is especially true for removals from forest management. One more general particularity is data uncertainty.
Average uncertainty ranges reported by Member States that are associated with estimates of the level of emissions and removals are relatively high (32 per cent) compared to emissions from fossil fuel combustion (1 per cent) for EU-15 countries.},

Algum tempo depois, durante alguns meses, os consumidores ir{\~a}o receber os produtos. Atualmente, diversos pa{\'i}ses t{\^e}m uma parcela significativa da sua popula{\c c}{\~a}o vivendo na pobreza. Por isso, diversas pol{\'i}ticas p{\'u}blicas foram desenhadas nesses pa{\'i}ses com o objetivo de reduzi-la. O est{\'i}mulo {\`a} agricultura urbana {\'e} uma dessas pol{\'i}ticas. No entanto, frequentemente, os produtores urbanos pobres t{\^e}m dificuldades para adquirir os insumos necess{\'a}rios para manter a sua produ{\c c}{\~a}o. O apoio cont{\'i}nuo do governo local associado ao apoio cont{\'i}nuo da comunidade local poderia ajudar esses produtores a manter o seu sistema de produ{\c c}{\~a}o. E, para esses agricultores urbanos pobres, o projeto AAC poderia ser um meio alternativo de organiza{\c c}{\~a}o. O objetivo desse trabalho foi obter algumas informa{\c c}{\~o}es sobre o projeto AAC nos EUA e avaliar se consumidores e produtores urbanos pobres de uma cidade brasileira de baixa renda aceitariam se engajar neste tipo de projeto. Os produtores americanos envolvidos no projeto AAC em geral cultivavam uma {\'a}rea inferior a 2 ha, ofereciam diferentes tipos de hortali{\c c}as aos consumidores por pelo menos quarto meses e geralmente usavam pr{\'a}ticas de produ{\c c}{\~a}o org{\^a}nica. No entanto, havia dificuldades para a manuten{\c c}{\~a}o do projeto, sendo o planejamento da produ{\c c}{\~a}o e a dificuldade de sua manuten{\c c}{\~a}o ao longo do tempo os maiores problemas. Alguns consumidores da cidade brasileira pesquisada se mostraram dispostos a participar deste tipo de projeto principalmente pela possibilidade de receberem alimentos frescos e produzidos organicamente. No entanto, o mesmo n{\~a}o ocorreu com os produtores urbanos pobres da cidade. E a raz{\~a}o principal para isso foi a impossibilidade deles garantirem a produ{\c c}{\~a}o.

A pesquisa foi realizada em dois universos diferenciados, localizados na Regi{\~a}o Metropolitana de Curitiba: comunidade de Santo Amaro, formada por agricultores modernizados e a comunidade de Postinho, formada por agricultores que vivem em um cen{\'a}rio de precariedade social. Levando em conta que a ideia de patrim{\^o}nio familiar faz parte da l{\'o}gica organizacional da agricultura familiar, constatou-se que em ambos os casos ocorre um processo de repatrimonializa{\c c}{\~a}o de parte dos recursos naturais. Na pr{\'a}tica, verificou-se que as pol{\'i}ticas de conserva{\c c}{\~a}o da natureza atuam na forma{\c c}{\~a}o de um patrim{\^o}nio natural comum, com fun{\c c}{\~o}es sociais, mas permitem que se desenvolvam pr{\'a}ticas sociais e produtivas que comprometem a sustentabilidade socioambiental dos agricultores.

        abstract = {In addition to improved yields, the use of organic methods can benefit the nutritional value of foods in several ways, compared with subsistence agriculture, and in some respects also when compared with the use of high-input conventional farming methods. The recycling of organic matter retards depletion of the soil and ensures that increases in yield are not offset by mineral deficiencies caused by unbalanced plant nutrition. City populations can use organic products to minimize their intake of pesticide residues and nitrate. Improved nutritional status of crops under low-input conditions can increase the contents of protein and vitamin A, but can also increase the contents of some anti-nutrients. Improved availability of firewood through agroforestry enables thorough cooking to ensure removal of anti-nutrients and full utilization of nutrients. Increased diversity of crops not only provides a more dependable food supply, but also increases the chance for obtaining a full complement of nutrients due to the variability in composition of different staple crops. The increased use of pulses, vegetables and fruit also overcomes short-comings in the nutritional values of the main staple crops, such as maize and rice. However, to obtain the full benefits from these methods, substantially increased and much more targeted research on the development and use of organic agriculture methods under tropical conditions is necessary, especially in connection with subsistence agriculture.}

The analysis included a set of farms the concentration of which is in natural and climatic conditions typical for this type of farming high. The outputs may be therefore considered representative and generalised.
In order to determine the performance of these farms, their production basis was first assessed by using the indicators of available assets and assets coverage resources. Consequently, their efficiency was assessed based on the profit. For the purposes of comparison, the profit was (in various forms) converted to a hectare of agricultural land. The economic results were also compared with the average level achieved in the EU. The final part of the research focused on the evaluation of the economic and financial standing of the farms using selected return, liquidity, debt, and activity related ratio indicators. The established results show that the situation of organic farms on the national level tends to be economically more favourable. This is demonstrated by the higher share of profit-making farms and more favourable values of certain ratio indicators, i.e. those concerning profitability, liquidity, and interest coverage. The comparison with the average values achieved in the EU revealed a significantly more favourable situation in the Czech Republic.}

It strives to analyze as well the viability of organic farms and their contribution to sustainable agriculture and environment. At the same time, one of the paper's aims is to analyze whether the recent databases of organic farms and their structure contribute to meeting the above objectives. 

In order to assess the economic efficiency in a comprehensive manner, firstly the production base has been analyzed (equity, assets, liabilities). Secondly, the profit indicator has been employed while monitoring different kinds of profit and chosen financial ratios. The data for organic farms were recorded for a period of consecutive three years (2008, 2009 and 2010) in the South Bohemian region. Subsequently, their results were compared not only with conventionally farming enterprises but also with those of the FADN database. 
Primary data (for organic and conventional farms) were drawn from corporate financial statements. Both the FADN CZ database and annual statistical surveys of the Institute of Agricultural Economics and Information were used for the sake of comparison. 
It stemmed from the analysis that conventionally farming enterprises (legal entities) have higher average assets per hectare than the organic farms. As for the structure of assets, fixed assets record higher values than current assets in all samples surveyed (organic farms, conventional farms and FADN CZ farms).
In order to assess the enterprises' economic performance and efficiency, profit indicators were chosen. Profits were recorded in absolute values, i.e. the share of profit-making and loss-making farms was monitored. Subsequently, profits were calculated per hectare of farmland (three different profit indicators were employed) and then used for designing suitable efficiency ratios. The research showed that the share of profitable organic farms was (in all three years surveyed) much higher than in conventional agriculture. However, this result was conditioned by including subsidies in the total yields. As for the profit per hectare of farmland, organic farming also recorded higher average figures. 
The return on assets (ROA) ratio definitely recorded higher average figures than in the conventional farming sector while the return on equity (ROE) was not so much in favour of organic farming. The following financial ratios were adopted in order to assess the economic and financial situation of agricultural enterprises: return on assets, return on equity, liquidity, indebtedness, interest coverage and total assets turnover. All concrete results including detailed commentaries can be found in the present paper.

        abstract = {Wenn die Schweiz darauf verzichtet, genmanipulierte Pflanzen in die Umwelt freizusetzen, so ist dies vor allem auch eine grossartige Marktchance f{\"u}r die Schweizer Landwirtschaft. Denn Gentech-food ist out, in ganz Europa. Die Schweiz k{\"o}nnte dann das liefern, was eine gro{\ss}e Mehrheit gerne m{\"o}chte: naturnahe und gentechfreie Lebensmittel.
Die Frage ist blo{\ss}: Kann sich die Schweizer Landwirtschaft einen Verzicht auf Gentechnik leisten? Dieser Frage ist die Studie "Zukunftsmodell Schweiz - eine Landwirtschaft ohne Gentechnik?" nachgegangen. Untersucht wurden die sechs Kulturen Kartoffeln, Weizen, Mais, Raps, Salat und Reben.
Gentechnische L{\"o}sungsans{\"a}tze und die wichtigen Anbauprobleme der Schweizer Landwirtschaft sind sehr oft nicht deckungsgleich. Die Bek{\"a}mpfung der problematischsten Sch{\"a}dlinge bei den einzelnen Kulturen steht kaum je auf der Forschungsagenda der Gentechnik.
So steht bei der Herstellung transgener Pflanzen die Herbizidresistenz an oberster Stelle. In der Schweiz spielt aber bei den sechs untersuchten Kulturen die Unkrautproblematik nur gerade beim Mais eine gro{\ss}e Rolle. F{\"u}r viele Probleme der Schweizer Landwirtschaft ? so etwa f{\"u}r die Salatwurzellaus oder die Grauf{\"a}ule bei Reben, f{\"u}r die wichtigsten Rapssch{\"a}dlinge Rapserdfloh, Rapsglanzk{\"a}fer, Rapsstengelr{\"u}ssler und Kohlschottengallm{\"u}cke, bei Septoria- und Fusariosen-Schaderregern im Weizenbau, bei der Stengel- und Kolbenf{\"a}ule im Maisbau oder bei den verschiedenen Mehltauerregern ? bestehen keine oder erst vage gentechnische Ans{\"a}tze.
Im Biolandbau und im integrierten Landbau werden Anbauprobleme und Schadorganismen im Gegensatz zur Gentechnik meistens nicht als isolierte Einzelfaktoren bek{\"a}mpft. L{\"o}sungsans{\"a}tze bestehen aus einem umfassenden System vieler verschiedener Ma{\ss}nahmen. Dabei spielen die Vorsorge, die Ursachenbehebung, die F{\"o}rderung von nat{\"u}rlichen Regulationsmechanismen und N{\"u}tzlingen eine zentrale Rolle. Zu diesen L{\"o}sungs- und Forschungsans{\"a}tzen geh{\"o}ren unter anderem: gute Anbautechnik (z.B. standortgerechter Anbau, Regulierung des Bestandesklimas, vielseitige Fruchtfolgen, Anbaupausen, ausgewogene D{\"u}ngung, F{\"o}rderung der Bodenfruchtbarkeit und des krankheitsabwehrenden Potentials des Bodens mit Kompost), (traditionelle) Z{\"u}chtung resistenter Sorten (bei der auch genetische Diagnosemethoden Fortschritte bringen k{\"o}nnten), Einsatz von umweltvertr{\"a}glichen Pestiziden und Antagonisten (das sind R{\"a}uber der Sch{\"a}dlinge; gegen den Maisz{\"u}nsler sind zum Beispiel die Schlupfwespe Trichogramma, sowie Bacillus thuringiensis- oder Beauveria bassiana-Pr{\"a}parate bekannt).
Prognose- und Fr{\"u}hwarnsysteme versprechen weitere Fortschritte in der Regulierung von Schadorganismen: Kenntnisse {\"u}ber die Biologie und Ausbreitung des Sch{\"a}dlings, die n{\"o}tigen klimatischen Parameter wie Temperatur, Niederschlag und Luftfeuchtigkeit werden in mathematische Modelle eingespeist. Daraus l{\"a}sst sich das Infektionsrisiko errechnen, so dass m{\"o}glichst wenig gespritzt werden muss. In der Schweiz wurden Prognose-Modelle f{\"u}r den Rebbau, den Kernobstbau, den Getreidebau und den Kartoffelbau entwickelt. Sortenmischungen geh{\"o}ren ebenfalls zu den pr{\"a}ventiven Methoden, die in allen Anbausystemen angewendet werden. Die Mischung von verschiedenen Sorten kann insgesamt gegen{\"u}ber Krankheitsbefall resistenter sein, da die Sorten unterschiedlich auf Schaderreger und Umweltbedingungen reagieren. Ein vermutlich gro{\ss}es Potential liegt in der induzierten Resistenz (Anregung der pflanzeneigenen Abwehrf{\"a}higkeit gegen Schaderreger), welche sich noch im Forschungsstadium befindet. Die Abwehrbereitschaft kann nicht nur durch durch einen Krankheitserreger ausgel{\"o}st, sondern auch durch Substanzen induziert werden, die diesen Angriff nachahmen. Pflanzen k{\"o}nnen sich somit aktiv gegen Krankheitsbefall wehren. Typischerweise zeigt eine induzierte Pflanze Resistenz gegen{\"u}ber einer Vielzahl von Pilzen, Bakterien und Viren.

Gentechnische Methoden sind nicht nachhaltig. Sie zementieren eine problematische, auf Monokulturen basierende High-input-Landwirtschaft, welche die bekannten Umweltprobleme mitverursacht (Gew{\"a}sserverschmutzung, Sch{\"a}digung der Bodenfruchtbarkeit und Artenverlust). Die Freisetzung von gentechnischen Organismen birgt zudem viele unberechenbare und langfristige Risiken (Auskreuzung von transgenem Pollen, Resistenzdurchbr{\"u}che, Sch{\"a}digung von Nicht-Ziel-Organismen, Antibiotika-Resistenzen, unerwartete Positionseffekte, Allergien etc). Unter {\"o}konomischen und sozialen Kriterien der Nachhaltigkeit f{\"a}llt ins Gewicht, dass gentechnisch ver{\"a}nderte Pflanzen patentiert werden k{\"o}nnen, konventionell gez{\"u}chtete Pflanzen hingegen nicht. Die durch ein Patent garantierten ausschliesslichen Monopolrechte k{\"o}nnen f{\"u}r die betroffenen Landwirte und vor allem auch f{\"u}r L{\"a}nder des S{\"u}dens zu einer zunehmenden Abh{\"a}ngigkeit und einer Konzentrierung des Saatgut-Weltmarktes auf einige wenige transnationale Life-Science-Konzerne f{\"u}hren.
Der Biolandbau erf{\"u}llt die Forderung der Nachhaltigkeit am besten. Die {\"o}kologischen Vorteile gegen{\"u}ber dem konventionellen Landbau wurden mehrfach wissenschaftlich belegt (h{\"o}here Bodenfruchtbarkeit und Artenvielfalt, weniger R{\"u}ckst{\"a}nde). Auf der Ebene von Einzelbetrieben zeigen inzwischen mehrere Studien, dass der Biolandbau unter den derzeitigen Rahmenbedingungen eine gute betriebswirtschaftliche Alternative darstellt. Dank starker Diversifizierung der meisten Biobetriebe werden zus{\"a}tzliche Arbeitspl{\"a}tze geschaffen.
Wie diese Studie aufzeigt, liegen trotz vergleichsweise sehr kleinen Mitteln in der Bioforschung f{\"u}r die meisten Schl{\"u}sselprobleme des Landbaus L{\"o}sungen oder L{\"o}sungsans{\"a}tze vor.

Dieser Indikator wurde auf Daten der Zentralen Auswertung der Agrarumweltindikatoren (ZA?AUI) angewendet, in der durchschnittlich 226 Betriebe {\"u}ber f{\"u}nf Jahre erfasst sind. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass ein Ackerbaubetrieb nur einen durchschnittlichen Bodenbedeckungsgrad von 62\% erreicht, deutlich weniger als der fast 100\%ige Bodenbedeckungsgrad eines Graslandbetriebs. Einige Kulturen weisen einen mangelhaften Bodenbedeckungsgrad auf, namentlich Winterweizen, der nur einen durchschnittlichen Bedeckungsgrad von 44\% erreicht. Mit bestimmten Anbaumethoden wie der Anbau einer Zwischenkultur zwischen zwei Hauptkulturen und die Nutzung von Ernter{\"u}ckst{\"a}nden kann aber die durchschnittliche Bodenbedeckung deutlich verbessert werden.}

Comparisons of feed intake, milk production, live weight (LW), feed efficiency and animal health were conducted, based on records from 145 dairy cows (238 parities). A lower daily metabolisable energy (ME) intake, lower milk yield and a higher protein content were recorded in the organic herd during the first ten weeks of lactation. No differences were recorded between the systems in either average total DM intake or efficiency of feed conversion, calculated as MJ of feed/kg of energy-corrected milk (ECM). There were a trend to lower LW change and better health in the organic herd. Most differences between the systems were recorded during the early lactation period.},

Four methods have been previously proposed in literature: Simple Sine, Double Sine, Simple Triangle, and Double Triangle methods. The other four methods are proposed in this research: Simple Logistic, Double Logistic, Simple Normal, and Double Normal. The estimation of the degree-days through hourly temperature values was used as the reference standard method, and the four localities from where the temperature values were taken were the municipalities of Cajic{\'a} (Cundinamarca), Santa Elena (Antioquia), Carepa (Urab{\'a} Antioque{\~n}o), and Ciudad Bolivar (Zona cafetera Antioque{\~n}a). Degree-days obtained by all methods under study were compared through linear regression to those obtained by the reference standard method. There were differences in the correlation of each method to the reference when compared within each region and among regions.  The Simple Logistic and Double Logistic methods showed the best performance with acceptable R2 values and considerably lower bias than the other methods.  The poorest fit was found in Cajic{\'a}, where the average R2 was 0.571.  For the regions of Santa Elena and Carepa, the average R2 was 0.756 and 0.733.  The best fit was found in Ciudad Bolivar, with an average R2 of 0.826.}

The overall objective of this experiment is to improve understanding and use of subsidiary crops in conservation agriculture systems under the Mediterranean environment of central Italy. 
Field experiment was set up in September 2012 at the experimental farm of Tuscia University (UNITUS). A  2-year durum wheat ? tomato sequence was foreseen. In the first year of study the treatments consisted in: (i) four different crops sequences (durum wheat  + hairy vetch cover crop; durum wheat + black oat cover crop;  durum wheat/ subclover living mulch; durum wheat + fallow); (ii) three nitrogen fertilization levels to the wheat (0\%, 50\%, and 100\% of total nitrogen recommended dose).

        abstract = {Agriculture must meet the twin challenge of feeding a growing population while simultaneously of minimizing its global environmental impacts. The organic farming, which is a system aimed at producing food with minimal harm to ecosystems, is often proposed as a possible solution. However, critics argue that organic agriculture may give lower yields and therefore more land is required in order to produce the same amount of food of the conventional farms, resulting in more widespread deforestation and biodiversity loss, thus undermining the environmental benefits of organic practices.
The long-term experiment was established in 2001 in order to compare organic vs. conventional cropping systems and inversion vs. non-inversion soil tillage. A 3-year crop rotation (chickpea, durum wheat and tomato)was established in both cropping systems. In the organically managed cropping system, the crop rotation was implemented with hairy vetch and oilseed rape cover crops which were green manured before tomato transplanting and chickpea sowing, respectively (Fig. 1). The soil tillage were: (i) inversion tillage consisting in moldboard plowing (depth of 30 cm) + disc harrowing; (ii) non-inversion tillage consisting in subsoiling (depth of 20 cm) + disc harrowing.
In this poster are reported the results of 2013/2014 cropping season on the yield and weed biomass observed in durum wheat, chickpea and tomato crops. },

The water consumption was obtained through soil water balance, using TDR probes installed at 0.15m and 0.30m deep. At the different stages of development, the Kc was determined by the ratio of ETc and reference evapotranspiration, obtained by Penman-Monteith FAO 56. The crop coefficients obtained were 0.35, 0.45, 1.29 and 0.63. The accumulated ETc obtained in the field was 109.6 mm, while the ETc accumulated from FAO's Kc were 142.2 and 138mm, respectively, considering the classical values and the values adjusted to the local climatic conditions. The simulation of water consumption based on meteorological data of historical series from 1961 to 2007 provided higher value of ETc when compared with the one obtained in the field. From the meteorological data of historical series, it was observed that the use of Kc recommended by FAO may overestimate the amount of irrigation water by 9\%, over the same growing season. },

The project allowed co-design experiences and led to the development of a new tool for ex ante assessment of AFS. First results show a 52\% reduction of pesticides on the TAB system compared to a conventional reference system while reaching yield objectives, and a very low reliance to pesticides on the Durette system. As for biodiversity, specific richness of birds increased from 12 to 24 species on the Durette system, from 24 to 35 on the TAB system. Spatial planning fulfills the working organization, but does not make it possible to fully control pests yet. Results will be consolidated in the continuing EMPUSA project (2019-2025). Both sites are now important demonstration sites for farmers and agricultural advisors interested in implementing AFS.},

        abstract = {Risker som {\"a}r f{\"o}rknippade med kemiska v{\"a}xtskyddsmedel kan sammanfattas i fem omr{\r a}den: risker f{\"o}r anv{\"a}ndare, risker f{\"o}r rester i livsmedel samt i yt- och grundvatten och risker f{\"o}r natursystemet (t.ex. f{\"o}rlorad biodiversitet). De viktigaste f{\"o}rdelarna med v{\"a}xtskyddsmedel {\"a}r att de bidrar till sk{\"o}rde{\"o}kningar och att de f{\"o}rb{\"a}ttrar m{\"o}jligheten till stabila sk{\"o}rdeniv{\r a}er, oavsett {\r a}rsm{\r a}n.

Det finns olika strategier f{\"o}r att hantera v{\"a}xtskyddet i dagens jordbruk och beroende p{\r a} vilken strategi som v{\"a}ljs f{\"o}r{\"a}ndras riskerna som {\"a}r f{\"o}rknippade med anv{\"a}ndningen av v{\"a}xtskyddsmedel. Syftet med MAT 21-projektet H{\r a}llbart V{\"a}xtskydd har varit att analysera den milj{\"o}m{\"a}ssiga h{\r a}llbarheten i olika v{\"a}xtskyddsstrategier med hj{\"a}lp av konkreta exempel. Ambitionen {\"a}r att ge v{\"a}gledning om genomf{\"o}randet av politiska milj{\"o}m{\r a}l, tolkning av milj{\"o}analyser och utveckling av kvalitets- och milj{\"o}ledningssystem i livsmedelsf{\"o}retag.

I projektet har en varierad v{\"a}xtf{\"o}ljd setts som en viktig f{\"o}rebyggande {\r a}tg{\"a}rd f{\"o}r att minska riskerna med v{\"a}xtskyddsmedel. En diversifierad v{\"a}xtf{\"o}ljd bidrar till att reducera vissa typer av ogr{\"a}s och till att minska trycket av m{\r a}nga svampsjukdomar. Mekanisk ogr{\"a}sreglering ger tillsammans med f{\"o}rebyggande {\r a}tg{\"a}rder m{\"o}jligheter att minska anv{\"a}ndningen av v{\"a}xtskyddsmedel. Exempel p{\r a} tekniska l{\"o}sningar som kan minska riskerna {\"a}r bandsprutning i kombination med radrensning eller ny bredsprutningsteknik med lufttillsats vilket reducerar vindavdriften vid en applikation med v{\"a}xtskyddsmedel.

F{\"o}r att analysera riskerna som {\"a}r f{\"o}rknippade med v{\"a}xtskyddsmedel anv{\"a}ndes modellen PRI-Farm som {\"a}r en riskindikatormodell utvecklad av Kemikalieinspektionen. I modellen po{\"a}ngs{\"a}tts faktorer f{\"o}r fara och exponering vid applikation av v{\"a}xtskyddsmedel. Farofaktorerna utrycker belastningen av de inneboende egenskaperna hos preparatens aktiva substans som persistens, bioackumulering och r{\"o}rlighet. Exponeringsfaktorerna beaktar applikationsmetod, anv{\"a}nd dos, markegenskaper och spruttidpunkt. Resultaten v{\"a}gs samman i en po{\"a}ngsumma (ett milj{\"o}riskindex), d{\"a}r risk f{\"o}r transport till yt- och grundvatten v{\"a}ger tungt. {\"A}ven ett h{\"a}lsoriskindex kan ber{\"a}knas, vilket inte gjorts i denna studie. Modellen kan inte anv{\"a}ndas f{\"o}r att kvantifiera risker utan {\"a}r i st{\"a}llet ett verktyg f{\"o}r att kunna g{\"o}ra j{\"a}mf{\"o}rande bed{\"o}mningar mellan olika strategier f{\"o}r v{\"a}xtskyddsinsatser, identifiera problemanv{\"a}ndningar eller f{\"o}r att visa p{\r a} risktrender {\"o}ver tiden.

F{\"o}r att analysera andra milj{\"o}effekter (t.ex. klimatp{\r a}verkan och energianv{\"a}ndning) anv{\"a}ndes metodiken f{\"o}r livscykelanalys (LCA). Detta {\"a}r en metod som anv{\"a}nds f{\"o}r att g{\"o}ra milj{\"o}bed{\"o}mningar av produkter och tj{\"a}nster. Man genomf{\"o}r ber{\"a}kningar f{\"o}r produktens potentiella bidrag till olika milj{\"o}effekter, s{\r a}som v{\"a}xthuseffekt och f{\"o}rsurning, och man summerar {\"a}ven den f{\"o}rbrukning av viktiga resurser som produkten givit upphov till. Tanken {\"a}r att dessa ber{\"a}kningar skall kunna ge information som kan leda till att man kan minska milj{\"o}p{\r a}verkan fr{\r a}n en viss produkt p{\r a} ett effektivt s{\"a}tt. Resultaten kan ocks{\r a} ge v{\"a}gledning vid val mellan produkter som {\"a}r likv{\"a}rdiga i {\"o}vrigt. 

I fallstudien av den allsidiga v{\"a}xtodlingsg{\r a}rden j{\"a}mf{\"o}rdes ocks{\r a} nul{\"a}get med ett scenario d{\"a}r g{\r a}rden lades om till ekologisk produktion. I detta alternativ anv{\"a}ndes inga kemiska v{\"a}xtskyddsmedel. Oml{\"a}ggningen till ekologisk produktion p{\r a}verkade {\"a}ven andra milj{\"o}effekter, f{\"o}rutom riskerna med v{\"a}xtskyddsmedel. En negativ effekt av det ekologiska scenariot var att gr{\"o}dan kepal{\"o}k fick utg{\r a} p.g.a. att risken bed{\"o}mdes som f{\"o}r stor f{\"o}r ett stort sk{\"o}rdebortfall utan tillg{\r a}ng p{\r a} fungicider. P{\r a} grund av en l{\"a}gre sk{\"o}rdeniv{\r a} i ekologisk produktion beh{\"o}vdes en betydligt st{\"o}rre yta f{\"o}r att producera en given m{\"a}ngd livsmedel. I en ekonomisk analys j{\"a}mf{\"o}rdes nul{\"a}get p{\r a} den allsidiga v{\"a}xtodlingsg{\r a}rden med ett ekologiskt scenario. Resultatet var likv{\"a}rdigt f{\"o}r de tv{\r a} alternativen. F{\"o}r att ekologisk odling skall vara en ekonomiskt lyckad satsning p{\r a} g{\r a}rdar i intensiva sl{\"a}ttbygder med odling av specialgr{\"o}dor {\"a}r det, med dagens niv{\r a} p{\r a} milj{\"o}st{\"o}det f{\"o}r ekologisk produktion, helt n{\"o}dv{\"a}ndigt att det finns ett bra merpris f{\"o}r produkterna.

I en fallstudie av en allsidig v{\"a}xtodlingsg{\r a}rd j{\"a}mf{\"o}rdes nul{\"a}get med ett scenario d{\"a}r olika strategier testades som minskade riskerna med v{\"a}xtskyddsmedel utan att sk{\"o}rdeniv{\r a}n {\"a}ndrades n{\"a}mnv{\"a}rt. Detta scenario (kallat B{\"a}sta M{\"o}jliga Teknik) innebar anv{\"a}ndning av mekanisk och/eller termisk behandling som alternativ till konventionell bek{\"a}mpning i vissa gr{\"o}dor samt medvetna val av v{\"a}xtskyddsmedel som hade mindre d{\r a}liga milj{\"o}egenskaper. Fallstudien visade p{\r a} flera olika m{\"o}jligheter till att reducera riskerna i konventionell drift. Eftersom g{\r a}rden i studien hade m{\r a}nga radodlade specialgr{\"o}dor bed{\"o}mdes bandsprutning kombinerat med radrensning vara en intressant f{\"o}rb{\"a}ttring. Att v{\"a}sentligt reducera anv{\"a}ndningen av fungicider i potatis och l{\"o}k utan att {\"a}ventyra sk{\"o}rdeniv{\r a}n bed{\"o}mdes som mycket sv{\r a}rt i konventionell drift, {\"a}ven med b{\"a}sta odlingsteknik.

I fallstudien av den allsidiga v{\"a}xtodlingsg{\r a}rden j{\"a}mf{\"o}rdes ocks{\r a} nul{\"a}get med ett scenario d{\"a}r g{\r a}rden lades om till ekologisk produktion. Detta alternativ minskar riskerna med v{\"a}xtskydds-medel radikalt men p{\r a}verkar {\"a}ven andra milj{\"o}effekter. F{\"o}r m{\r a}nga gr{\"o}dor minskade energianv{\"a}ndning, liksom utsl{\"a}pp av v{\"a}xthusgaser vid en {\"o}verg{\r a}ng till ekologisk odling. En negativ effekt av det ekologiska scenariot var att gr{\"o}dan kepal{\"o}k fick utg{\r a} p g a att risken bed{\"o}mdes som f{\"o}r stor f{\"o}r ett betydande sk{\"o}rdebortfall utan tillg{\r a}ng till fungicider. Ur milj{\"o}- och resurssynpunkt var den mest negativa effekten att det ekologiska scenariot kr{\"a}vde mycket st{\"o}rre yta f{\"o}r att producera en given m{\"a}ngd livsmedel. I en ekonomisk analys j{\"a}mf{\"o}rdes nul{\"a}get p{\r a} den allsidiga v{\"a}xtodlingsg{\r a}rden med ett ekologiskt scenario. Resultatet var likv{\"a}rdigt f{\"o}r de tv{\r a} alternativen. F{\"o}r att ekologisk odling skall vara en ekonomiskt lyckad satsning p{\r a} g{\r a}rdar i intensiva sl{\"a}ttbygder {\"a}r det helt n{\"o}dv{\"a}ndigt att det finns ett bra merpris f{\"o}r produkterna.

Studien visar att det finns flera olika strategier f{\"o}r att minska riskerna med anv{\"a}ndningen av v{\"a}xtskyddsmedel. En varierad v{\"a}xtf{\"o}ljd {\"a}r en grundl{\"a}ggande f{\"o}ruts{\"a}ttning i alla odlingssystem och inom detta omr{\r a}de finns det mycket gammal kunskap som beh{\"o}ver v{\"a}ckas till liv. Milj{\"o}analyserna visar ocks{\r a} att m{\r a}nga tekniska l{\"o}sningar, som leder till minskat behov av v{\"a}xtskyddsmedel, kan till{\"a}mpas utan att andra milj{\"o}effekter p{\r a}verkas n{\"a}mnv{\"a}rt. Att v{\"a}lja bort v{\"a}xtskyddsmedel som har mindre goda milj{\"o}effekter {\"a}r en strategi som f{\"o}refaller ha stor potential f{\"o}r att minska riskerna. PRI-Farm kan bli ett viktigt beslutsst{\"o}d i lantbrukets arbete f{\"o}r b{\"a}ttre produktval och s{\"a}krare v{\"a}xtskydd. Ekologisk produktion har goda f{\"o}ruts{\"a}ttningar att bli en viktig strategi f{\"o}r minskade risker i de ut{\"o}kade vattenskyddsomr{\r a}den som kommunerna nyligen har beslutat om. F{\"o}r att denna strategi skall bli lyckosam kr{\"a}vs att marknaden forts{\"a}tter att {\"o}ka f{\"o}r ekologiska produkter i Sverige, s{\r a} att produkternas merpris tillsammans med samh{\"a}llets st{\"o}d via milj{\"o}ers{\"a}ttningsprogram forts{\"a}tter att betala merkostnaden f{\"o}r denna produktionsform.

F{\"o}r att ta tillvara p{\r a} erfarenheter fr{\r a}n Formas p{\r a}g{\r a}ende forskningsprogram f{\"o}r ekologisk produktion (Formas-eko) och fr{\r a}n liknande program i Danmark, har lektor Vibeke Langer i samarbete med lektor Jesper Rasmussen vid Kungl. Veterin{\ae}r- og Landboh{\o}jskole i Danmark ombetts att utv{\"a}rdera i vilken grad intentionerna i Formas forskningsprogram uppfyllts i projektbeskrivningarna av p{\r a}g{\r a}ende projekt inom Formas-eko. Utv{\"a}rderingen finns tillg{\"a}nglig p{\r a} CUL:s hemsida (CUL, 2003). 

Det reviderade ramprogrammet fokuserar p{\r a} fr{\r a}gor som har prioriterats av akt{\"o}rer inom det ekologiska lantbruket och ska ses som ett komplement till andra dokument vid SLU, t.ex SLU:s nya forskningsstrategi som {\"a}r under utarbetande.

Arbetet har skett i en {\"o}ppen process inom ramen f{\"o}r Centrum f{\"o}r uth{\r a}lligt lantbruks (CUL) verksamhet. Ett hundratal personer har varit involverade i arbetet med att g{\"o}ra en omfattande inventering av kunskapsluckor och kunskapsbehov.

The widely use of chemicals in order to increase agricultural production is one of the main problems in this sense. To take into consideration this common problem, environmentally friendly production methods of organic farming as an alternative to conventional agriculture in different countries are put forward and accepted by both manufacturers and consumers, as well. In this study, the effects of different soil application forms and soil tillage techniques on the disease output of powdery mildew (Erysiphe necator) and grape yield in an organically managed vineyard with variety ?Sultanina? were investigated. Soil applications were consisted of zeolite, farmyard manure, green manure, liquid fertilizer Bioplazma and E2001, a commercial organic biological suspension. The soil cultivation methods were mulching, use of chisel and the combination of   plow + harrow. All the specified applications were conducted in combination with each other in the organically managed vineyard of the Research Institute of Viticulture, Manisa, for a period of three years.  A vineyard in the vicinity of experimental vineyard which was managed with conventional cultivation methods was chosen to compare the results between organic and conventional systems. As in experimental organic vineyard, this vineyard was also visited at corresponding time intervals for disease monitoring and recording. The study has shown that zeolite application, depending upon the years, increased the incidence of powdery mildew. Application of organic fertilizers, due to stronger vegetative development, has resulted with more disease severity, changing with years, compared to the control. In the plots cultivated with chisel and mulching, a reduced disease severity was recorded in comparison with plow cultivation in both of organic and conventional plots.}

        abstract = {Modern agricultural technology, in all its aspects, has enabled increased agricultural production to meet the growing demand for food and fulfill the Sustainable Development Goals of the UN Agenda 2030. Yet the impact of these achievements on soil degradation and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is considerable. Agricultural practices that increase soil carbon stocks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as outlined under the international 4per1000 initiative, constitute valuable strategies for mitigating global warming while increasing soil carbon stocks and ensuring soil health. The objective of this proposal is to evaluate the influence of conservationist and regenerative agricultural practices on carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling, soil biodiversity and GHG emissions with a particular emphasis on long-term SOC stocks, and processes governing C persistence. This project represents an exploratory effort to couple the stoichiometric drivers to microbial populations related to C, N, and P cycling and stocks, and GHG emission under diverse agricultural practices. To this end, we set up a long-term consortium of field experiments that assess the impact of different cropping systems and agricultural practices on soil properties. The participants from twelve different countries represent a total of 37 field sites with different time sequences and/or contrasting agricultural management. Twenty-six sites have been established for at least ten years. At each site, estimates and modelling scenarios of possible N2O, CO2 and CH4 emissions from crop/pasture/forestry systems will be carried out using best available IPCC or local emission factors and GHG emissions will be measured at a subset of sites. To compare the impact of different climatic and edaphic conditions among sites, we propose a standard soil organic matter (OM) physical fractionation procedure resulting in two contrasting soil fractions including particulate organic matter (POM), which consists mainly of partially decomposed plant residues, and the mineral-associated OM (MAOM), principally of microbial origin. This project will build a worldwide database of C and N stocks, bulk density, soil fertility and GHG emissions across different ecosystems and under differential agricultural management. Moreover, the project will determine the extent to which climatic conditions, net primary production of cropping systems and soil type affect carbon and nitrogen stocks, nutrient dynamics and greenhouse gas emissions. The final product of the project will be to recommend best management practices for production of food crops which would promote soil C accumulation, especially MAOM, without increasing GHG emissions thus contributing to the sustainability and resilience of agriculture.},

The aim of this work is to analyse the changes in diversity of the weed flora, including segetal and rare species, and of crops in 20 fields (ca. 50 ha) after the conversion to organic farming during 5 cropping periods (2005-2010). Number of cultivated crops has increased from 1 to 17 including ancient and local varieties of cereal and legumes. Weed biodiversity increased by a 50\% in five years at field and regional scale. Crop rotations and sowing organic seeds from other farmers can contribute to the increase and the conservation of the weed diversity in the arable agroecosystems, including segetal species which are currently rare or even have disappeared from most of the conventional arable fields.},

The organic animal husbandry is far more sophisticated and knowledge intensive system of' animal production meant to safeguard not only the human health but also the welfare of animals and the environment on the whole.

It can be said that two approaches have been taken to conservation start-up processing - North American and European. Research in North America focuses mainly on zero soil processing, with this type of soil treatment barely practised in Europe, and those in Europe focusing on reduced soil treatment by reducing the depth of processing or applying non-inverting soil treatment practices. The main problems are related to the control of entanglation, absorption of nutrients, as well as yields. No-till and reduced till soil treatment systems are considered sustainable soil conservation options. Long-term implementation of reduced soil treatments is an effective strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional soil processing, improve soil structure, favour CH4 absorption and inhibit N2O emissions.},

quickly as possible. In Part II of the "Review of the applications of satellite remote sensing in organic
farming," we examine the various areas of satellite data application in organic farming. Five different
areas of satellite data application in organic farming have been identified, including satellite remote
sensing monitoring of weeds, remote sensing of crop stress and irrigation needs, yield forecasting using
remote sensing methods and remote sensing monitoring of plant nutrition. From the review conducted,
we found that satellite data can significantly support and facilitate the transition to organic farming,
adequate fertilization, application in phytosanitary monitoring of crops, and assessment of crop stress.},

Andererseits entstehen Betrieben, die umweltfreundlich produzieren Einkommensverluste durch eine geringere Produktivit{\"a}t. Be-sonders betroffen sind davon auch Betriebe des {\"o}kologischen Landbaus. Im Ergebnis der GATT-Verhandlung/Uruguay Round wurde Inlandsintervention mittels der Preisunterst{\"u}t-zung f{\"u}r die Agrarprodukte beschr{\"a}nkt (Seo et al. 1996).
Deshalb geh{\"o}rt zu den Ma{\ss}nahmen der F{\"o}rderungspolitik das Programm "Direkte Subventi-onszahlungen f{\"u}r umweltfreundliche Landwirtschaft" (MAFF, 2001; Lee, 1998). Dadurch sollen die Einkommensverluste der entsprechenden Betriebe durch direkte Zahlungen ausge-glichen werden und die Situation kleinb{\"a}uerlicher Familienbetriebe verbessert wird. 
Am Direkten Subventionszahlungsprogramm k{\"o}nnen Betriebe unter folgenden Bedingungen teilnehmen:
Lage: in Naturschutzgebieten
Betriebsgr{\"o}{\ss}e: gr{\"o}{\ss}er als 1000m?
Anbaustruktur: Landwirtschaftliche pflanzliche Produktion
Einhaltung von Grenzwerten f{\"u}r D{\"u}nge- und PSM
Teilnahme des Betriebsleiters an einem Seminar.
Allerdings sind neben den positiven Intentionen auch eine Reihe von Problemen bei der Um-setzung erkennbar.

        abstract = {Conventional cropping systems rely on targeted short-term fertility management, whereas organic systems depend, in part, on long-term increase in soil fertility as determined by crop rotation and management. Such differences influence soil nitrogen (N) cycling and availability through the year. The main objective of this study was to compare nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soil under winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) within three organic and one conventional cropping system that differed in type of fertilizer, presence of catch crops and proportion of N2-fixing crops. The study was replicated in two identical long-term crop rotation experiments on sandy loam soils under different climatic conditions in Denmark (Flakkebjerg?eastern Denmark and Foulum?western Denmark). The conventional rotation received 165?170 kg N ha-1 in the form of NH4NO3, while the organic rotations received 100?110 kg N ha-1 as pig slurry. For at least 11 months, as from September 2007, static chambers were used to measure N2O emissions at least twice every calendar month. Mean daily N2O emissions across the year ranged from 172 to 438 ?g N m-2 d-1 at Flakkebjerg, and from 173 to 250 ?g N m-2 d-1 at Foulum. A multiple linear regression analysis showed inter-seasonal variations in emissions (P{\ensuremath{<}}0.001), but annual N2O emissions from organic and conventional systems were not significantly different despite the lower N input in organic rotations. The annual emissions ranged from 54 to 137 mg N m-2, which corresponded to 0.5?0.8\% of the N applied in manure or mineral fertilizer. Selected soil attributes were monitored to support the interpretation of N2O emission patterns. A second multiple linear regression analysis with potential drivers of N2O emissions showed a negative response to soil temperature (P=0.008) and percent water filled pore space (WFPS) (P=0.052) at Foulum. However, there were positive interactions of both factors with NO3-N, i.e. high N2O emissions occurred during periods when high soil nitrate levels coincided with high soil temperature (P=0.016) or high soil water content (P=0.056). A positive effect (P=0.03) of soil temperature was identified at Flakkebjerg, but the number of soil samplings was limited.  Effects of cropping system on N2O emissions were not observed. },

        abstract = {Cacao agroforestry systems offer a wide range of ecosystem services beside food and timber production, such as biodiversity, carbon sequestration, microclimate regulation, water infiltration etc. which makes them interesting for farmers as well as for society. In many cases the mid to long-term benefit for farmers from the shade trees is not known. To assess the added value of timber and fruit trees, 16 smallholder cacao agroforestry fields in Alto Beni, Bolivia were selected in 2017 with the criteria of having dynamic agroforestry or diverse agroforestry systems implemented. Fields were georeferenced and tree inventories established. Quantitative and qualitative data of the timber trees were taken. The farmers were interviewed concerning the fruit tree productivity and use of the harvest. The regulative governmental entity for timber tree management was interviewed for assessment of the timber value chain. The cacao agroforestry plantations have an average age of 18 years. For the total of 2?941 timber trees the species were identified (72), 20\% of it were Swietenia macrophylla, which makes it the most popular timber species. Followed by Myroxylon balsamum, Amburana cearensis and Centrolobium ochroxylum. The average timber tree density was 154 trees/ha and the standing timber volume was 38.8 m?/ha. The value of the standing timber was evaluated in average of 12?947 USD/ha. This value needs to be reduced due to lack of professional timber processing. Most numerous fruit are banana, followed by the fruit trees of Bactris gasipaes, Oenocarpus bataua, citrics and Garcinia gardneriana.There is a marked difference in fruit tree density according the agroforestry system, dynamic agroforestry systems harbor much more fruit trees compared to the simpler agroforestry systems which have the focus on timber. With the aim to increase farmer?s income from timber as well from fruit trees the value chains need to be strengthened.},

        abstract = {The availability of nitrogen to crop plants is a universally important aspect of soil quality, and often nitrogen represents the immediate limitation to crop productivity in modern agriculture. Nitrogen is decisive for the nutritive value of plant products and plays a key role in the environmental impact of agricultural production. The fundamental doctrine of nitrogen management is to optimise the nitrogen use efficiency of both introduced and native soil nitrogen by increasing the temporal and the spatial coincidence between availability and root uptake of mineral nitrogen. Natural ecosystems have evolved to produce a high degree of coincidence and maintain a relatively tight nitrogen cycle. The management needed to assure the vitality of crop cultivars with a high production potential cause agroecosystems to be relatively open with respect to nitrogen. By shifting the focus from sheer productivity to a balance between productivity, product quality and environmental impact, the management of agroecosystems can be redesigned to allow for a higher nitrogen use efficiency. The important management measures to improve the nitrogen aspect of soil quality are crop sequences that incorporate cover crops, judicious use of soil tillage, improved timing and use of animal manures, crop residues and mineral fertilizers, and a sustainable balance between plant production potential and animal stocking density. This chapter addresses the characteristics of nitrogen cycling in plant production, the premises upon which an improved nitrogen use has to be based, and discusses management principles that can improve nitrogen use in cropping systems.},

A 3?year study in the Central Anatolian Region of Turkey compared the persistence, productivity and nutritive value of sainfoin planted with nurse crops, namely Hungarian vetch (Vicia pannonica Crantz.) or triticale ({$\times$} Triticosecale Wittm, ex A. Camus), at three seeding rates. Sainfoin and nurse crop emergence were significantly affected by the companion nurse crop, sowing rate and establishment year. The number of sainfoin plants at emergence was lower during a drier ?bad? year (110 plant/m2) than in a ?good? precipitation year (236 plant/m2). Triticale had a more negative impact on sainfoin growth than vetch. Planting nurse crops at high seeding rates (90 kg/ha) reduced the number of sainfoin seedlings as compared to the control, while the low seeding rate had little impact on sainfoin emergence. Planting sainfoin with triticale resulted in much greater yield exceeding 10 t/ha, but reduced the forage nutritive value compared to sainfoin monocultures and sainfoin?vetch mixtures. The seeding rate of the nurse crops during a dry year did not affect DM yield in the year of establishment nor in the following year. The findings of this study indicate that planting sainfoin with a nurse crop can substantially increase the DM yield in the year of establishment without yield penalties in the subsequent years, despite fewer established plants, as compared to sainfoin monocultures.}

An experiment was established to investigate the productivity and N capturing abilities of barley (Hordeum vulgare cv. Cowboy) and oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus L.) crops seeded after a grazed green manure. Green manure was a mix of forage pea (Pisum sativum cv. 40?10), soybean (Gylcine max cv. Prudence) and oat (Avena sativa cv. Legget). The experiment was repeated twice in Carman, Manitoba in 2010 and 2011. Catch crops were seeded in late summer either no-till or after soil cultivation of the grazed plots. Wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Waskada) was seeded in the second year as a test crop for both experiments. Catch crop productivity and N uptake was influenced by season (greater in the wetter year) and catch crop type (barley and radish produced 1990 and 1490 kg ha?1, respectively) but not tillage system. The catch crops had their greatest overall effect on soil NO3-N content in 2010 under conditions of high autumn precipitation when N leaching was more severe. Here, the catch crops significantly reduced NO3-N at all depths. Under drier conditions in 2011, catch crops only reduced NO3-N in the top 30 cm. There was average 57 and 12 kg ha?1 more soil NO3-N in plots with no catch crops than plots where catch crops were grown in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Wheat N uptake at maturity was reduced around 25\% when grown after catch crops. Similarly, wheat grain yield was 12?31\% less after catch crops than no catch crops. This study showed that catch crops can be used to capture excess nutrients after grazing, but N release from the selected catch crops in the following year was not in synchrony with the wheat N demand.}

The first part, after a brief literature review of the most recent statistical methodologies applied to identify the two similar groups of farms, presents some key economic variables (production, costs and revenues) and the most widely-used structural, economic and balance sheet indexes.
The second part describes findings from a case study on the Italian fruit-growing sector.
A non-parametric input-oriented frontier analysis (Data Envelopment Analysis, DEA)was used to evaluate which technique makes better use of their disposable productive inputs. Findings show that organic farmers can (partially) overcome the productivity gap (with respect to conventional ones) by more efficient use of their inputs (with respect to their own frontier).}

In order to identify some of the main differences between organic and conventional farms a ?distance analysis? has been carried out. The study aims to highlight some of the main characteristics of those two groups of farms to better address differences (if any) in production technology, costs and revenues. Furthermore it shows the findings of a non-parametric efficiency analysis on the Italian olive-growing farms. The purpose is to estimate difference in efficiency and productivity between organic and conventional olive producers. Results reveal that looking at the average values on Invested Areas, conventional farms? Gross Production is significantly higher than the organic ones, as the Net Margin, as the Net
Product and Costs. The average values on Total Labour Force instead, shown that, even if
conventional farms still have higher values than organic ones, the ?distance? become shorter. That means that the two groups are quite similar and that, even if organic farms still produce a lower ?economic value?, they better compensate productive factors, especially in terms of Labour Force. Regards to efficiency analysis, we found that organic olive-growing farms are more able in using their disposable resources (with reference to their own frontier), and the higher efficiency permits them to compensate the lower productivity with respect to the conventional farms.},

There was no yield decline evident across years despite a decline in the proportion of red clover. The Early harvest schedule and sowing ryegrass with red clover increased herbage yield and digestibility. March application of fertiliser N to red clover treatments reduced annual yield. Early harvest schedule increased and both fertiliser N and sowing with ryegrass decreased the proportion of red clover. Sowing with ryegrass improved indices of ensilability but reduced crude protein. Both red clover cultivars had similar performance characteristics. A selected red clover-based treatment, considered to exhibit superior overall production characteristics, out-yielded perennial ryegrass plus fertiliser N in mid-season.

Average energy consumption ranges from 5 000 to 12 270 MJ/ha/year depending on the intensification level. Energy production varies from 35 500 to 43 950 MJ/ha/year. Since energy consumption and production both vary in the same direction with the degree of intensification, the energy gain is stable at an average value of 29300 MJ/ha/year. Energy efficiency decreases from 7.1 MJ/MJ for unfertilised and unirrigated crop sequences, to 3.5 MJ/MJ for fertilised and irrigated sequences, where soy and faba bean are among the major crops. },

T{\"u}rkiye. The 4
th International Conference on Organic Agriculture in Mediterranean Climates: 
Threats and Solutions organized together with Ecological Agricultural Organization Association

Research (ISOFAR), Ege University Agriculture Faculty, the Aegean Exporters' Associations, {\.I}zmir 
Fair Services Culture and Art Works Trade. Inc. (IZFA{\c S}) and Mediterranean Agronomic Institute of 
Bari (CIHEAM Bari). The Conference was a three-day meeting consisting of oral and poster 
presentations and panel discussions. The Conference was organized at the {\.I}zmir Fair (Gaziemir) 
Conference Hall, which also hosts two fairs as Ekoloji for organic products and services, OLIVTECH 
Olive, Olive Oil, Dairy Products, Wine \& Technologies Fair during the same period. This created an 
opportunity to visit stands and meet the exhibitors.
The 4
th International Conference on Organic Agriculture in Mediterranean Climates: Threats and 
Solutions aimed to bring together academia and practice in the Mediterranean as well as in regions 
where Mediterranean climate prevails. The participants could be able to discuss different facets of the 
threats of today and future posed on organic agriculture and deliver applicable solutions during the 
conferance. The climate change issue was a major threat with high probability and high impact on land, 
water biodiversity and human resources, which in turn affects the system designs, production patterns, 
pest, disease, and weed prevalence, human resources, and the marketing channels of organic goods 
and services. The Mediterranean Sea is already a tragic symbol of migration. Migration whether 
domestic from rural towards urban or to other countries, or from one continent to the other will be 
triggered with the climate change and others as economic or political instability. Aging of the population 
especially in rural requires innovative solutions not only in agriculture but also in related fields. Organic 
agriculture with basic principles that favor health of the soil, plant, animal, human and planet as 
indivisible can bring solutions for agroecosystem management to overcome challenges of climate 
change and deliver healthy and nutritious produce. Services brought by can be better preserved, 
managed and/or diversified. The Mediterranean diversity embeds healthy diets, culture, and tourism as 
regional values. Sharing research results, experiences and best practices could contribute to identify 
the problems and threats, to discuss sustainability point of view, to derive applicable solutions and to 
establish cooperation for future networking. This very rich and diverse programme was only possible 
thanks to a strong engagement of the organizing committee (Alexis Giannarakis, Alev K?r, Barbaros

        abstract = {In dairy farms, new rearing practices of calves with nurse cows have been developed by farmers but still remain poorly documented. The objective was to assess the impact of rearing suckling calves with nurse cows on the same pastures on the risk of gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) infection in calves. The grazing management has been recorded for each group. Serum pepsinogen level and GIN egg excretion per gram of faeces (epg) were determined in 438 calves belonging to 38 groups from 30 farms in the western part of France at housing (October 2018 to January 2019). The maximum number of infective larval generations met by the animals (LG) in each pasture plot was modelled by Parasit?Sim expert system. The data were analyzed using logistic regression (univariate and multivariate). Mean parasiticological parameters per group were low. On average, the serum pepsinogen level was 1.1 units of tyrosine (U Tyr) and the GIN egg output was 130 epg. Pasture infectivity was above LG4 for 2/3 of the groups. These results suggest that rearing suckling dairy calves with nurse cows decreases the level of GIN infection in calves at the end of the 1st grazing season compared with putting out to pasture weaned heifers alone. This can be explained by i) the fact that cows were immune and have a cleansing effect on the pastures when eating a lot of larvae while excreting few eggs and ii) Because not weaned calves had a slow larval intake when drinking milk from nurse cows.},

Les valeurs moyennes de pepsinog{\`e}ne s{\'e}rique et du ratio de densit{\'e} optique (RDO) des taux d'anticorps anti-Ostertagia {\'e}taient globalement faibles en SP1 (respectivement 0,97 {\`a} 1,60 Unit{\'e} Tyrosine et RDO de 0,23 {\`a} 0,71), indiquant une faible exposition des g{\'e}nisses aux SGI en pr{\'e}sence des nourrices. Ceci est vraisemblablement d{\^u} {\`a} l?alimentation majoritairement lact{\'e}e des jeunes, la pr{\'e}sence de vaches nourrices immunes sur les parcelles et une conduite protectrice au p{\^a}turage. Les cons{\'e}quences en SP2 des infestations sont tr{\`e}s d{\'e}pendantes de la dur{\'e}e de la SP1. Les g{\'e}nisses n{\'e}es au printemps avec une longue SP1 ({\ensuremath{>}}180 jours), avaient de faibles niveaux d?excr{\'e}tion f{\'e}cale d{\`e}s le milieu de la SP2 sugg{\'e}rant la mise en place d?une immunit{\'e}
vis-{\`a}-vis des SGI. Alors que les g{\'e}nisses n{\'e}es {\`a} l?automne, avec une courte SP1 ({\ensuremath{<}} 90 jours) avaient une exposition aux SGI n{\'e}gligeable en SP1. En SP2, leurs indicateurs parasitaires correspondaient {\`a} ceux des g{\'e}nisses en SP1.

En conclusion, avec une bonne gestion de p{\^a}turage, les g{\'e}nisses n{\'e}es au printemps avaient peu de risque parasitaire. Une naissance plus tardive entraine une dur{\'e}e de SP1 plus courte, insuffisante pour le d{\'e}veloppement de l?immunit{\'e} et pouvant entra{\^i}ner un risque parasitaire en SP2.}

This work aims at determining the practical conditions for implementing agricultural systems considered to be sustainable from an environmental point of view. Two organic dairy systems considered to be environmentally friendly ex ante have been designed in partnership with the staff of the INRA research team of Mirecourt. A grazing dairy system and a mixed-crop dairy system are being experimentally tested at the system scale. The two systems have environmental and agricultural objectives. They are managed using multi-objective decision rules and are assessed on their biotechnical and practical properties, using a structured multiyear experimental design, completed by a model-based assessment. Assessment is oriented towards progressive and permanent re-designing of the systems in order to increase their environmental sustainability and feasibility at the practical level. Knowledge acquired from the two prototypes will then have to be validated on commercial farms.}

          author = {Dr William F. Cormack},
            year = {2000},
        abstract = {This is the final report of Defra project OF0182. The attached main report starts with a more detailed Executive Summary, from which most of this text is extracted.
One of the possible benefits from organic farming is a reduced, or more efficient, use of energy in agriculture. The main objective and deliverable of study OF0182 was to develop a model of energy inputs in organic farming systems. To illustrate the potential of the model, it was used to contrast organic with similar conventional systems and to highlight important differences. This was presented as a detailed written report (49 pages) to MAFF and is summarised in this document. The report and model were delivered to MAFF in March 2000.
A previous study, completed by Phil Metcalfe of ADAS in 1996 for MAFF ARP Division, entitled ?A Comparison of Energy use in Organic and Conventional Agricultural Production Systems?, compared direct and indirect energy use in simple individual crop and livestock enterprise models. These were combined to give whole-system models covering dairy, beef and arable farming. These systems were presented as organic conversion scenarios in the MAFF booklet ?Organic Conversion Information Service? (1996). Project OF0182 updates the models developed in 1996 and expands the study to include upland beef and sheep, and vegetables. The dairy, vegetables, arable and upland beef/sheep models are based on the MAFF funded studies OF0146, OF0126, OF0145 and OF0147 respectively. The study also included a consideration of food distribution costs and the possible substitution of labour for energy. The data was organised into a system of linked spreadsheets to form the model
The dominant energy inputs in conventional agriculture are indirect energy for the manufacture and transport of fertilisers, particularly nitrogen, and indirect energy for the manufacture and transport of pesticides. These together account for around 50\% of the total energy input to a potato or winter wheat crop, and as much as 80\% of the energy input into some vegetable crops. Organically grown crops require around 50\% of the energy input per unit area than do conventional crops, largely because of lower, or zero, fertiliser and pesticide energy inputs. However, the generally lower yields of organic crop and vegetable systems reduce the advantage to organic when energy input is calculated on a unit output basis. In stockless arable crop rotations, the inclusion of fertility building crops and winter cover crops, that have energy inputs but no direct outputs, can result in a lower whole-rotation energy efficiency from organic methods. In livestock systems, where the fall in output may be less than in arable, and there are no dedicated fertility building crops, overall energy efficiency is greater in organic than in comparable conventional systems.
These conclusions were made using average yield data in the model and need to be interpreted with caution. On more fertile soil, where the yield difference with conventional arable production is smaller, organic systems would perform relatively better. The converse would occur on poorer soils. Also, in practice, energy inputs for cultivations and weed control will vary with soil type, weather, weed spectrum and population. The average data presented in the report are illustrative and are not definitive. The strength of the model is that it can be used to simulate many different management systems and yield expectations.
The models also allowed a range of transport scenarios to be considered. There was little opportunity found for replacing energy with labour resources.},

A network of field experiments was built to study the benefits of crop diversification in time and space in organic systems in five countries in Europe. Different strategies of crop diversification are combined at the rotation scale. The insertion of spatial diversification (cereal-grain legume intercropping, strip cropping both in arable and vegetable systems) in a cropping system should be encouraged owing to positive effects on yield and ecosystem services, based on the first results obtained in the network.}

Family farming is an important way to ensure agricultural and forestry production, as well as fishing and grazing, managed and run by a family that mostly depends on unpaid family labour, both women and men. From the 570 million farms in the world, over 500 million are family farms. In Portugal, 96\% of the farms are of the family-type, which permanent and predominantly use labour belonging to the family.
There are numerous examples in which, through organic farming, family farming can be lead to new heights of success and innovation, with direct impact on the increase in the farm income. 
The benefits that may accrue from the adoption of organic farming on family holdings in Mediterranean countries such as Portugal, Italy and Spain are analysed, its impact and major constraints, as well as the contribution that new forms of teaching and learning can make to its spread and success, including through project-based technologies and m-learning, as it is the case of the project ECONewFARMERS - Building a future for new farmers in ecological farming through vocational training.},

        abstract = {The POULTRYNSECT Work Package 1 ?Optimization of Hermetia illucens rearing protocols? aims to rear black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) for the poultry feeding trials in WP2. The WP is divided into four different tasks. The first two tasks concern to adjust the nutritional composition of the BSFL by testing different diet formulations for BSFL with by-products from the agri-food chain. This report joins the preliminary results obtained from the in vivo trials 
performed with Hermetia illucens (INAGRO) for deliverable 1.1 and 1.2. Raising BSFL from their neonate stage to larvae of a Harvestable size is not rocket science. 
However, to do this consistently on a feed composed of by-products from the agri-food chain with varying composition and properties, and meanwhile keeping feed conversion, larvae size, nutritional composition and harvestability of the final product consistent can be rather challenging.
Potential feedstocks of different origin were collected and analysed for their macro nutritional content in order to make mixtures that are more or less in line with the requirements of BSFL as they are currently presumed optimal.
Black soldier fly larvae can be reared on an array of different by-products from the agri-food chain as long as their nutritional needs are met to some extend and the physical properties of the feed are hospitable for the larvae. However, using a different diet might result in larvae with a different composition. Especially fat content seems to vary strongly between diets. 
Especially when the diet is rich in non-fibre carbohydrates the larvae seem to incorporate it into fat.
For the poultry trials larvae of consistent quality will need to be reared over prolonged periods. 
Due to the inherent nature of agricultural by-products they are only available seasonally and often only for short periods. As for retailer waste, it is very variable in composition and also seasonally dependant. To have controlled conditions for the poultry feeding trials its seems therefore necessary to use a control feed for the larvae, preferably a feed that can be reproduced in other BSFL rearing facilities.},

        abstract = {This study aimed to compare conventional livestock production systems in relation to other forms that implement ecological production, evaluating environmental variables (in water: nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, pH and availability of oxygen using photometrics methods and Winkler modified method. In soils: counts of bacteria and fungi using MPN method, and physicochemical properties. In meadows: Prairie composition, quantity and density of arthropods), productive variables (in forages: biomass estimation using the methodology by Campbell and Arnold, nutritional quality using bromatology methods, in animals: milk production, weight gain, and carrying capacity), and economic variables (Fertilization cost and control ecto-endo parasites cost) in 6 farms Township Guayabal de S{\'i}quima (Colombia). Three of them were classified as conventional while other three farms were classified as ecological in relation with management. The variables were compared statistically using T-test. The work established effects of conventional systems on water quality, significant differences were found between the affluent and effluent water for variables such as pH (P = 0.046), nitrate NO3-N (P = 0.027),  and phosphorus as PO43- (P = 0.000). In the ecological management systems, the values associated with nitrate as NO3-N and phosphorus in the effluent water decreased and increased available oxygen. Regarding the microbiological analysis of soil found in most bacteria counts made for ecological systems being found significant difference (P = 0.003) compared to the conventional system as well as many fungi although there was no statistical difference between the two systems. The botanical composition of grasslands showed highly significant difference (P = 0.000) for the amount of grass being higher in organic farms than in conventional and the amount of weed (P = 0.000) being higher on conventional farms. Forage production per year was higher in conventional farms, enabling higher carrying capacity on them but not significant difference between the systems.  The development of silvopastoral systems in the ecological farms, allowed the incorporation of various species in the animal feed, and probably influenced the diversity of arthropods in the meadow, along with other practices that additionally favored an integrated pest management. An evaluation of 12 indicators related with sustainability evidenced the best results in ecological systems.},

An inventory of 31 farm types was constructed on the basis of 2138 farm accounts from 1999 selected and weighted to be representative for the Danish farming sector. The farm accounts were grouped according to the major soil types, the num-ber of standard working hours, the most important enterprise (dairy, pig, different cash crops) and the stocking rate (livestock units per hectare). For each group the account data on the average inputs and outputs, land use and herd structure was used to establish a farm type model with coherency between livestock production, total feed use, land use, yields, im-ported feed, home-grown feed, manure production, fertiliser use and crop production. The set of farm types were scaled up to national level thus representing the whole Danish agricul-tural sector for the included products. The sum of area and yield by crop, number and pro-duction by livestock type and the use of fertiliser, energy and concentrated feed was checked against national level statistics and corrected accordingly across all farm types. Resource use and emissions in each farm type was established using standard nutrient concentrations and models for nutrient cycling, energy use and emissions of e.g. ammonia, nitrous oxides and methane. For LCA the product oriented inventory was established using system expan-sion rather than allocations to account for the secondary enterprises in the livestock farm types. Data are made available on a web-based database and may be used for analyses of the primary production systems or as input for LCA across the whole production chain. },

When the combined effect of the various GM contamination stages is calculated, the worst-case predictions of the different stages are normally added. This additive procedure to estimate the combined effect of GM contamination may be relevant to estimate the combined effect where a single farm is concerned, but may result in estimation errors when harvested seeds from a large number of farms are mixed. In this study, the consequences of treating the different stages of GM contamination as independent stochastic effects on the combined GM contamination have been estimated. A case study of GM contamination in organic and conventional oilseed rape crops under Danish conditions indicated that the greater part of GM contamination occurred at farm level and much less during transport and storage. Generally, it may be concluded that it is important to consider this uncertainty in the estimates of adventitious presence at each seed production step and also whether the different steps are independent.},

        abstract = {1. The probability distribution that seeds of organically farmed oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) are pollinated by pollen grain produced in a neighbouring field of genetically modified oilseed rape is calculated based on a meta-analysis of available gene-flow data.
2. The probability of foreign pollination is modelled as functions of the width of the pollen receiving field and the distance to the pollen donor fields.
3. The significance of using a buffer zone (i.e. a 1-5 m broad border of the organic field, which is excluded from the harvest) to reduce GM-pollination of the crop, is quantified and discussed.
4. Quantitative estimates of the probability of foreign GM-pollination are relevant to organic and conventional farmers in order to suggest minimum isolation distances and other management strategies to keep GM-pollination below threshold values for fields situated near conspecific GM-crops. A 95\% credibility level of the gene dispersal from a GM oilseed rape into another rape field is calculated as a function of e.g. the isolation distance between fields. Analysis of different management strategies shows that an increasing isolation distance is more effective to reduce GM pollen dispersal than the use of a buffer zone, especially for small organic fields. If the width of the organic and conventional field can be increased, this has the overall largest effect in reducing the level of GM-pollination from pollen.

A greenhouse trial with 14 varieties of tomatoes was developed. They were: PeaceVein, Ildi Red and Yellow, Black Plum, Chadwick, Saint Pierre, Thessaloniki, TSW10,  Platense Gentile, Money maker, Mars, Uco Plata and the hybrid Koyi (from TheRuiterSeeds) and Elpida (Syngenta). Phenological and reproductive characteristics and agronomic profile of each variety were evaluated. The results concluded that some varieties are suitable to be incorporated to the horticultural trade as a complement of organic vegetables in the Horticultural Greenbelt in Buenos Aires.

A model was created using the software SuperPro Designer in order to design and study in detail the construction and operation of an industrial scale plant based on the mentioned project. To achieve this, theoretical mass balances were calculated using experimental data and, once designed, an economic assessment was performed to analyse the feasibility of the process.  It was concluded that a large scale implementation of this project is economically viable as the estimated profits were higher than the Annual Operating Costs (AOC) and the calculated payback time was 4,14 years. The Return On Investment (ROI) of 24,14\% also supported the feasibility of the project. However, the production of biogas had the higher contribution in the estimated profitability, meaning that the creation of a plant only for protein production would not be sustainable.}

Ces perspectives d'{\'e}volution des syst{\`e}mes agricoles camarguais ont {\'e}t{\'e} {\'e}valu{\'e}es, via la formalisation de nombreuses donn{\'e}es et connaissances. Deux outils de mod{\'e}lisation ont {\'e}t{\'e} utilis{\'e}s : un mod{\`e}le multi-agent a permis la mise en place de s{\'e}ances de simulation interactives avec des agriculteurs, et un mod{\`e}le bio{\'e}conomique a {\'e}t{\'e} d{\'e}velopp{\'e} et utilis{\'e} avec des acteurs locaux tels que le syndicat des riziculteurs et le parc naturel r{\'e}gional. Les sc{\'e}narios portant sur la r{\'e}forme de la PAC ont confirm{\'e} la d{\'e}pendance des exploitations rizicoles aux subventions. Des agriculteurs ont test{\'e} diff{\'e}rentes strat{\'e}gies d'adaptation de leurs exploitations {\`a} la suppression de l'aide coupl{\'e}e {\`a} la production rizicole. Ces strat{\'e}gies, souvent bas{\'e}es sur la diversification des activit{\'e}s ou sur la conversion {\`a} l'agriculture biologique, ne permettaient pas de compenser les pertes {\'e}conomiques li{\'e}es {\`a} la disparition de l'aide coupl{\'e}e. A l'{\'e}chelle du territoire, ces strat{\'e}gies r{\'e}duiraient fortement la surface cultiv{\'e}e en riz, avec des impacts importants sur d'autres activit{\'e}s en lien avec la production agricole. Cependant ces strat{\'e}gies vont dans le sens des objectifs gouvernementaux de r{\'e}duction des impacts de l'agriculture sur l'environnement. Des sc{\'e}narios portant sp{\'e}cifiquement sur ces objectifs ont permis d'identifier des marges de manoeuvre importantes au niveau des exploitations c{\'e}r{\'e}ali{\`e}res camarguaises. Cette th{\`e}se propose un cadre pour la mise en oeuvre de d{\'e}marches d'{\'e}valuation des syst{\`e}mes agricoles dans un territoire, qui associe les agriculteurs et les acteurs locaux {\`a} diff{\'e}rentes {\'e}tapes, depuis leur engagement pour le choix des sc{\'e}narios, l'acquisition et l'analyse des donn{\'e}es, la construction des outils de simulation et l'{\'e}valuation de sc{\'e}narios. La combinaison de diff{\'e}rents outils de mod{\'e}lisation pour la r{\'e}alisation de r{\'e}flexions collectives, pourrait contribuer {\`a} la mise en place d'actions pour un d{\'e}veloppement durable de l'agriculture.},

(lit. problem-solving creativity) for ages; they have fed others in the plain as in the mountain, under dictatorship as under ?democracy?. However, farmer newspapers today say we may disappear soon; ?eternal? peasant population rushes to the bottom.
Are we really going to disappear? How and why did we get to this situation? What is going on in farms today? What are farmers? plans and projects? What futures do these projects lead to? This is in short the structure of this MSc thesis. This alarming observation motivated me to go and see in farms, not only at home but also to colleagues? in order to better see, understand phenomena going on in the reality of farms, and to reflect deeper on underlying issues. Thus, I phoned a few cousins and other colleagues and told them I was interested in their ?inventivit{\'e}? (inventiveness), their own way of doing things; I asked them to go and work with them in their own farm, in their daily activities -whatever it would be- to understand why and how they are looking to change their routines, i.e. for novelties.}

This process can be depicted by four models defined by two axes, a socio-economic axis (individual logic vs. collective governance), and an agro-ecological axis (analytical vs. systemic approaches). These models differ in: (i) their objectives (from improvement in yield to the empowerment of farmers), (ii) their specific expectations with respect to genotypes (from inherited genetic resources to varieties that represent genetic, ethical and social progress), and (iii) their representations of the environment (from a simple interaction between the bio-physical environment and crop management, to a complex interaction including the skills of stakeholders, outlets, regulations and society). Taking this diversity into account changes the way plant improvement is envisioned. Depending on the model, the five classic stages of plant improvement (setting objectives, creating variability, selecting, evaluating and disseminating) may be called into question. Between the existing analytical model (model I) and a holistic model (model IV) that remains to be developed, lies the challenge of ensuring the sustainability, efficiency and acceptability of plant breeding and resulting innovations.},

This chapter presents the different evaluation methods that can be used, as well as the trade-offs to be made in order to choose the approach that is most appropriate for the innovation under study and for issues raised by the evaluation.

The aim of this study was to evaluate management influence on phytosociology of the herbaceous layer, defined as the layer of herbs, sub-shrubs, shrubs and vines, in two agroforestry systems (AFS) (Simple and Biodiverse) in succession to a reforestation of guanandi (Calophyllum brasiliense), compared to monoculture of this specie taken as control. The experiment was conducted in Pindamonhanga (SP), Brazil, from 2011 to 2014, in a randomized block design with eight replications and 144.0 m? plots. In Simple SAF area, food crops were grown alongside C. brasiliense rows: sweet cassava (Manihot esculenta) in rotation with arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), banana shrub (Musa sp.), and ju{\c c}ara palm (Euterpe edulis). In Biodiverse AFS, fourteen native tree species were also planted alongside the food crops. Altogether 41 non-stratified species, 38 genera and 24 botanical families were identified; the most abundant families were: Asteraceae, Poaceae e Cyperaceae. The similarity between the areas diverged after three years of management, with the predominance of Commelina benghalensis and M. arundinacea in the AFS areas and Urochloa decumbens in the monocultive, mainly, due to the shadow gradient established for the three systems.}

In mountain areas of the Massif Central (central France), mixed dairy/suckler cattle systems enable farmers to use grassland resources better and cope with economic fluctuations. 
Our objective was to estimate levels of ecosystem services provided by mixed dairy/suckler cattle systems as a function of the degree of mixing, along with their greenhouse gas emissions and energy use when their operation is optimized on an economic basis. The hypothesis was that mixed dairy/suckler cattle systems allow for controlled use of biomass, with better environmental performances than specialized systems (pure dairy or suckler herd) by maintaining grassland ecosystem services. Five herd-distribution scenarios were simulated using the Orfee bioeconomic optimization model. Environmental performances of the five systems were assessed according to three functional units (i.e., per farm, ha and kg protein produced). 
Mixed dairy/suckler cattle systems, which enabled larger herds, had higher greenhouse gas emissions per ha than specialized systems. However, because dairy cows produce more protein (milk and beef) than suckler cows, specialized dairy systems had the lowest greenhouse gas emissions and energy use per kg of protein. Specialized dairy systems had less advantage when dairy cows had less access to grassland. For the production of both milk and beef, mixed dairy/suckler cattle systems favour more sustainable use of biomass and tend to maintain a better combination of levels of ecosystem services for livestock production than specialized cattle farming systems.},

Four quarterly updating visits were performed on the 26 land units of the System from January 2003 to December 2005. Cartographic documents and QuickBird satellite images were also used to generate the final index maps for agrodiversity, fallow intensity and green manure use intensity. A high diversity of crops was observed. In some land units up to 40 plant species were recorded. However, this diversity was not uniformly distributed throughout the terrain. A high intensity of land use, mostly with annuals was also observed in a large part of the area. In most cases, fallow periods were up to 3 months in 3 years. Since annual crops demand intense tillage, minimum or no tillage practices are recommended for those areas to improve soil conservation. The use of legumes was less frequent on the land units used for annual crops. They were not uniformly distributed throughout the terrain. The results of this research are useful not only for those who are interested in the system itself, but also to validate the hypothesis that through GIS it is possible to summarize complex agroecological information into a visually friendly format, allowing easy interpretation of systemic analyses.

In order to contribute to the goal of 100\% use of organic and regional feed for monogastrics, this knowledge synthesis ?Feeding monogastrics 100\% organic and regionally produced feed? aims to describe: 
?	the protein need for organic monogastric animals (pigs, layers and broilers), including different breeds and rearing conditions
?	different protein feed resources, mostly new or not commonly used protein sources, their nutrient content, production prerequisites, and their potential feeding value
?	small-scale, on-farm equipment for feed processing 
?	different feeding strategies. 
The knowledge synthesis should enable participants in Innovation groups (IG) and Thematic groups (TG) to choose feed materials, feeding strategies, breeds and perhaps even small-scale on-farm equipment for testing when aiming at 100\% organic and regionally produced feed for monogastrics.
In the knowledge synthesis it is concluded: When feeding pigs and poultry 100\% organic and regionally produced feed, getting enough protein and specific amino acids is a challenge. There are two ways to go and they can be combined. One is to utilize by-products, for example waste from various productions, and explore new protein sources e.g. marine products or to refine already known products such as grass. The other way is to feed the animals less intensively and for this feeding strategy slow-growing breeds fit better. Some slow-growing breeds are already known, some are rediscovered old breeds. The challenge with the slow-growing and less-yielding breeds is that the production is getting smaller and either the farmer will earn less or the prices of eggs and meat will increase. 
However, the possibilities for combinations of regionally grown feed, low-yielding breeds with different feeding strategies are many and they need to be explored.
Finally, the knowledge synthesis identify needs for new knowledge on:
?	nutritional requirements of alternative breeds. Precise nutrient recommendations for organically produced pigs and poultry do not exist.
?	nutritional value of new protein sources for monogastric animals
?	various combinations of breeds, grazing and supplemental feed.

Small-scale on-farm equipment to refine locally produced raw materials needs to be developed.},

	Em 2007, foi realizada a oficina "Comunidade Saud{\'a}vel" com representantes do poder p{\'u}blico, universidade e lideran{\c c}as comunit{\'a}rias com perguntas condutoras para responderam ?O que {\'e} mais importante, poss{\'i}vel realizar / proporcionar uma comunidade saud{\'a}vel na regi{\~a}o dos Amarais??. A sugest{\~a}o foi trabalhar nos eixos sa{\'u}de, meio ambiente e educa{\c c}{\~a}o; entre as propostas foi escolhida a implanta{\c c}{\~a}o de hortas comunit{\'a}rias.
	Da proposta inicial de horta comunit{\'a}ria, o movimento passou por v{\'a}rias fases: solicita{\c c}{\~a}o de cess{\~a}o de {\'a}rea p{\'u}blica, funda{\c c}{\~a}o de uma Associa{\c c}{\~a}o para ser a beneficiaria da {\'a}rea, instala{\c c}{\~a}o de ponto de {\'a}gua, iniciativas de produ{\c c}{\~a}o, organiza{\c c}{\~a}o do grupo, orienta{\c c}{\~o}es para produ{\c c}{\~a}o de olericultura org{\^a}nica. 
	Atualmente o grupo de agricultores e agricultoras da horta recebe orienta{\c c}{\~o}es para a produ{\c c}{\~a}o de hortali{\c c}as org{\^a}nicas. O programa {\'e} estruturado em preparo do solo e aduba{\c c}{\~a}o verde, compostagem, produ{\c c}{\~a}o de mudas, tratos culturais, pragas e doen{\c c}as, colheita e comercializa{\c c}{\~a}o.
	A pesquisadora acompanha e colabora com o planejamento da implanta{\c c}{\~a}o da horta comunit{\'a}ria, mant{\'e}m um caderno de mem{\'o}ria das atividades da horta, e atrav{\'e}s da metodologia de hist{\'o}ria oral, coleta depoimentos dos agricultores e agricultoras sobre o processo de migra{\c c}{\~a}o para a regi{\~a}o estudada e sobre as transforma{\c c}{\~o}es territoriais, as quest{\~o}es socioambientais, de sa{\'u}de e de consolida{\c c}{\~a}o da horta comunit{\'a}ria no bairro. 
	Desta experi{\^e}ncia formamos um mosaico de hist{\'o}rias que se cruzam e entrecruzam com quest{\~o}es sociais, migra{\c c}{\~a}o, adensamento populacional, transi{\c c}{\~a}o entre rural e urbano, mudan{\c c}as de h{\'a}bitos e alimenta{\c c}{\~a}o, qualidade de vida urbana.

High added value schemes, such as organic farming could help farmers and processors to face these challenges. The ?Montagne Bio project?, funded by the French Ministry of Agriculture studied and defined the conditions for the success of this development. We studied dairy farmers? views on organic production, described farm trajectories before and after conversion, and identified factors that contribute to the success or the failure of a conversion or of a collective development project. We tested and assessed a method to carry out projects for the development of organic farming in rural areas and built tools to support local stakeholders and extensionnists to manage such projects. The collective work in the project team made it possible to use new references by each partner and led to building a common view of farm trajectories and the development of organic food chains.},

        abstract = {As costs for mineral fertilisers rise, legume-based leys are recognised as a potential alternative nitrogen source for crops. Here we demonstrate that including species-rich legume-based leys in rotations helps to maximise synergies between agricultural productivity and other ecosystem services. By using functionally diverse plant species mixtures, these services can be optimised and fine-tuned to regional and farm-specific needs. Replicated field experiments were conducted over three years at multiple locations, testing the performance of 12 legume species and 4 grass species sown in monocultures, as well as in a mixture of 10 of the legumes and all 4 grasses (called the All Species Mix, ASM). In addition, we compared this complex mixture to farmer-chosen ley mixtures on 34 sites across the UK.

The trials showed that there is a large degree of functional complementarity among the legume species. No single species scored high on all evaluation criteria. In particular, the currently most frequently used species, white clover, is outscored by other legume species on a number of parameters such as early development and resistance to decomposition. Further complementarity emerged from the different responses of legume species to environmental variables, with soil pH and grazing or cutting regime being among the more important factors. For example, while large birdsfoot trefoil showed better performance on more acidic soils, the opposite was true for sainfoin, lucerne and black medic. In comparison with the monocultures, the ASM showed increased ground cover, increased above-ground biomass and reduced weed biomass. Benefits of mixing species with regard to productivity increased over time. In addition, the stability of biomass production across sites was greater in the ASM than in the legume monocultures. Within the on-farm trials, we further found that on soils low in organic matter the biomass advantage of the ASM over the Control ley was more marked than on the soils with higher organic matter content. Ecological modelling revealed that the three best multifunctional mixtures all contained black medic, lucerne and red clover.

Within the long term New Farming Systems (NFS) rotational study, the use of a clover bi-crop showed improvement to soil characteristics compared to current practice (e.g. bulk density and water infiltration rate). Improvements in wheat yield were also noted with respect to the inclusion of a clover bi-crop in 2010, but there was evidence of a decline in response as the N dose was increased. Cumulatively, over both the wheat crop and the spring oilseed rape crop, the clover bi-crop improved margin over N. The highest average yield response ({\texttt{\char126}}9\%) was associated with the ASM legume species mix cover cropping approach.},

        abstract = {Organic farming/products are becoming very necessary in today?s world to control ecosystem health and to impart related human health benefits, world over there is growing demand for organic produce. A field experiment was conducted at the research farm of Kilpest India Ltd., Bhopal, during 2009 on rice using BGA Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Nostoc muscorum and biological hydrolysate of Soybean .These treatments were compared with recommended dose of Fytozyme. Currently, fytozyme (40\% chemically hydrolysed protein solution) is being used as organic fertilizer world over which was taken as positive control. Cost of all the organic amendments were considered and kept at par with the Fytozyme. Results revealed a significant increase in growth parameters and straw yield in plot treated with Chlorella pyrenoidosa. Grain yield was also higher in C. pyrenoidosa (3.35 t/ha) followed by Fytozyme (3.05 t/ha) and Nostoc as well as biological Soy hydrolysate (both 2.81 t/ha). Thus concluding a better viable organic product.

For the experiments were used black polypropylene woven mulch (comparison wit bare soil), two varieties of early potatoes Finka and Katka. Black polypropylene textile was used in potatoes by organic agriculture and it had positive effect on soil temperature (in the depth of 100 mm). Slightly higher soil temperatures under black polypropylene mulch in the vegetation period after planting had favourable influence on earlier stands emergence. The soil water potential (in the depth of 250 mm) and also the soil water content have been beneficial for black polypropylene mulch. Significantly lower values of the soil water potentials have been found in the period after planting and at the end of vegetation. Black polypropylene mulch provided favourable temperatures and soil moisture. Post harvest analyses were focused on the determination of the yield and quality tubers from each variant.},

Results showed that the yield was influenced mostly by mulching (55.9 \%), then by variety (39.2 \%) and by growth structure (4.9 \%). The highest yield was reached in the variant with grass mulch applicated after planting. The yield of this variant increased statistically about 9.3 t/ha in comparison with control variant (bare soil). Results of the weed control showed a positive effect of grass mulch on weed biomass, where the lowest weed biomass was found out in variant with grass mulch applicated after planting (weed biomass was lower by 67.6 \% in comparison with the control variant - bare soil).},

        abstract = {The aim of this experiment was to evaluate influence of mulching on the tuber yield and on the number of ware potatoes. In organic farming grass mulch for potatoes was used in 2008. For the experiments different ways of mulching (grass mulch after planting, grass mulch after second hoeing) were used and compared with bare soil (control variant). The results showed that grass mulching had positive effect on the yield of ware potatoes and some of the yield-forming components. The yield of ware potatoes was significantly higher by 9.3 t/ha in comparison with control variant. The highest number of ware potatoes was found out in the variant with grass mulch after planting.},

Especially in plots with BTM were first formed ridges and covered by the black polypropylene non-woven textile and then they were planting. During vegetation the infestation of Colorado potato beetle (CPB), weeds biomass, course of soil temperature and soil water potential were assessed. The results showed that surface of GM had a positive effect on soil temperature reduction, soil water potential depression. This study also indicated a positive effect of GM on the larvae of CPB diminution, on the other hand higher incidence of larvae and higher defoliation was observed in BTM. GM had a significant effect on the yield of potatoes. The yield of ware potatoes was higher by 27 \% higher on plots with GM and by 16 \% lower on plots wit BTM in comparison with C. NeemAzal T/S decreased statistically significantly \% of defoliation and increased yield of ware potatoes by 35 \% in comparison with control. },

        abstract = {The ENFASYS conceptual framework is an important guide for conducting the research in the project, by introducing important concepts of the research topic under investigation, by defining how these concepts are related, and by shaping interactions between different teams and work packages within the project. The conceptual framework provides a coherent work that supports the combined consideration of (1) systems thinking on lock-ins and levers in farming and food systems that prevent transitions to more SFS; (2) behavioural factors affecting farmers- adoption of more SFS; (3) public interventions such as policies in the CAP, and agricultural and environmental policies in the member states and; (4) private interventions such as business strategies and social innovations ? to move farmers to more SFS.
Fehler! Verweisquelle konnte nicht gefunden werden. is a graphical representation of the ENFASYS conceptual framework. The first elements are the behavioural factors and systemic factors that have been identified as key elements enabling or hindering change toward sustainable farming systems (SFS). Behavioural factors refer to elements that relate to the capacity and motivations of individuals, such as farmers, buyers, citizens, investors to make decisions. It encompasses the whole range of factors that are to be considered in order to understand these decisions. Systemic factors are those constraining and motivating effects on individuals? actions of social dynamics of the systems or social structures in which actors are positioned. These systems consist out of social relationships between different actors, that constrain, enable and motivate actors depending on their position in various ways.
Figure 1: ENFASYS conceptual framework
We identified the multilevel perspective (MLP) on sustainability transitions as a powerful heuristic that provides key concepts potentially enabling to link behavioural and systemic perspectives in a single narrative for the project. At its core, the MLP describes the transition towards sustainability of different socio-technical systems by conceptualising them as a regime change induced by the scaling up of radical niche innovations. The MLP itself is a systemic perspective which does not explicitly address behavioural factors, but it does have the ability to pay attention to micro-level agency at the niche level, while still considering meso-level and macro-level dynamics and interactions between these multiple levels. On this basis, we?ve formed the hypothesis that the MLP can provide the broader framework to link the behavioural and systemic factors in the transition towards SFS.
ENFASYS aims at creating knowledge relevant to enable the transition towards SFS. The concept of three types of knowledge distinguishes the knowledge needed to generate change through a research project. First system knowledge refers to knowledge about ?what is?, that is the current situation about an issue. Target knowledge, defines how the system should look like in order to be sustainable. And finally, transformation knowledge focuses on how to get from the current to the desired situation. The three types of knowledge are all needed to understand public and private interventions which have already happened in farming systems, as well as to inform the design interventions design within ENFASYS to enable behavioural or systemic change. The interventions are the pivotal point between knowledge production within ENFASYS and its real-world impact.
The interdisciplinary nature of the ENFASYS project as well as the aim to bring together research traditions that share very different assumptions reinforces the need to develop a common language to enable collaboration, but also comparison and generalization across the different teams and work packages of the project. To do so, the concepts used in the CF need to be clearly defined, yet broad enough so that partners from different background can understand, but also make use of them. Therefore, we developed a glossary defining the main concepts, but also other related terms and concepts, to enable a common understanding.},

        abstract = {With increasing demands on limited resources worldwide, there is a growing interest in sustainable patterns of utilisation and production. Ecological agriculture is a response to these concerns. 

To assess progress and compliance, standard and comprehensive measures of resource requirements, impacts and agro-ecological health are needed. Assessment tools should also be rapid, standardized, userfriendly, meaningful to public policy and applicable to management. Fully considering these requirements confounds the development of integrated methods.

Currently, there are many methodologies for monitoring performance, each with its own foundations, assumptions, goals, and outcomes, dependent upon agency agenda or academic orientation. Clearly, a concept of sustainability must address biophysical, ecological, economic, and sociocultural foundations. 

Assessment indicators and criteria, however, are generally limited, lacking integration, and at times in conflict with one another. A result is that certification criteria, indicators, and assessment methods are not based on a consistent, underlying conceptual framework and often lack a management focus.

Ecosystem properties and principles of living systems, including self-organisation, renewal, embeddedness, emergence and commensurate response provide foundation for sustainability assessments and may be appropriate focal points for critical thinking in an evaluation of current methods and standards. A systems framework may also help facilitate a comprehensive approach and promote a context for meaningful discourse. Without holistic accounts, sustainable progress remains an illdefined concept and an elusive goal.

Our intent, in the work with this report, was to use systems ecology as a pedagogic basis for learning and discussion to:
- Articulate general and common characteristics of living systems.
- Identify principles, properties and patterns inherent in natural ecosystems.
- Use these findings as foci in a dialogue about attributes of sustainability to:
a. develop a model for communicating scientific rationale.
b. critically evaluate environmental assessment tools for application in land-use.
c. propose appropriate criteria for a comprehensive assessment and expanded definition of ecological land use.},

        abstract = {Mycotoxin contamination of organically grown cereals has been a growing concern during recent years, one of the most important being ochratoxin A (OTA). In countries with a temperate, humid climate, OTA is produced by Penicillium verrucosum and it is crucial to focus on the fungus to obviate problems. This paper presents results to elucidate different aspects of the ecology of P. verrucosum. In a survey of differently farmed soils, P. verrucosum was found in 11 out of  65 soils (35\% of the organically and 7\% of the conventionally cultivated), these being the first reports of its natural occurrence in soil. Except for two soils it was found with low frequencies (100-300 cfu g dry soil-1), and the results point to home grown seed as a potential risk of soil contamination. In a survey of organically grown grain, P. verrucosum was found in 51\% of the recently combined and not yet dried grain samples (60\% of the rye and 53\% of the wheat samples). This confirms that early contamination does take place and increases the demand for proper grain handling during drying and storage. Three case studies were performed at organic farms with different storage facilities. The results showed very clearly that there is no general risk of OTA contamination in organically cultivated grain. Within the same year, major differences between the farms were found and these differences were reproduced during three growing seasons. It therefore seems likely that an organic farming system, as such, does not present problems in relation to OTA contamination. It is, rather, certain management practices that are inappropriate and these management practices may be more prevalent in organic farming. This assumption is discussed in relation to home grown seed, crop rotation, organic fertilizers, exclusion of pesticides, and drying and storage facilities.},

Different people understand differently the word soil. The soil can be looked upon as a body of nature and a part of the landscape. To many people soil is the substrate for plant growth and a prerequisite for food production and wealth. A third and perhaps growingly important view is soil as the physical ground for housings, roads and industry.

Soil is important to the whole society, not only for the agricultural sector. Soil has important ecological functions as it interacts with the dead bedrock, the atmosphere, the water, and the living organisms. Important functions are:

Biomass producer and transformer
Geomembrane, filter and buffer
Habitat for living organisms
Raw material and building ground
Cultural heritage

Even if these important roles of soil are probably widely known, the world's soil resources are degraded at an alarming rate. This is well documented by for instance the World Resources Institute (http://www.nhq.nrcs.usda.gov/WSR/).

We need to care for our prime agricultural soils, soils which provide the green in urban areas, as well as soil resources in natural landscapes.

Soil and agricultural scientists have detailed knowledge of specific functions and processes in soil. Seminar topics in NJF?s Section 1 (Soils and fertilisers) in the recent years show that soil biology and ecology have been added to the previous production-related research such as tillage and fertilisation. We are now prepared to study the whole soil and we have to show that our knowledge concerns the society and not only the farmers and gardeners. We believe that the concept of soil quality will help us to improve our communication about soils and soil use. Politicians, authorities, and farmers need a soil quality classification that makes the choices between different soil uses and managements based on soil science. Such classifications have been used in agriculture for many years. However, it is necessary to develop them and relate the classification systems and parameters used to present-day problems and technology. It is also important to use in communication modern language, as less and less people have hands-on experience with soils in an agricultural context.

This seminar intended to elucidate and discuss the present knowledge and research that can help us assess the quality of soils and to identify key properties which may be used as indicators of soil health. The seminar showed that we possess the knowledge, and that we have a good base for the further work with the soil quality concept and its practical use.

On behalf of the Nordic Association of Agricultural Scientists I will thank the organising committee for a well planned and conducted seminar.

        abstract = {Organic production is based on agroecology, a science studying ecological farming systems from three dimensions: transdisciplinary knowledge, interdisciplinary agricultural practices and social movements. Their integration provides a way of generating collective action alternatives to the dominant food system.
Since a bit more than a decade, the European civil society, the farmers and organic farmers movements have debated in discussion forums about the future of the agriculture, demanding favorable changes for agroecological systems inspired by experiences linked to food sovereignty, socio-political principles (autonomy, ?active? participation of operators) and the enhancement of local  knowledge. In the context of EU policies highlighted by innovation, Agroecology is emerging as an innovative practice to integrate and improve the knowledge of farmers and to strengthen the profitability and sustainability of agricultural systems in order to offer more jobs, attaching greater importance to the role of women and, in turn, to facilitate the incorporation of young people to ensure generational change.
The Spanish Society of Organic Agriculture (SEAE) organize since 1994, every two years, its national scientific Congress where knowledge and proposals are shared and discussed among stakeholders (researchers, advisers, farmers, processors, etc..), and the results of research and recent innovations that support the development of the organic sector are presented and discussed. This forms a singular space dialogue where the organic production chain agents can get inspired to generate new ideas. Twelve years ago this forum was extended to Ibero-American countries. Since the previous edition (2012) SEAE combines this congress with its General Assembly and the Awards for the generation and management of agro-ecological knowedge (Eco-eLabora).
The city of Vitoria-Gasteiz was chosen as host of the XI Congress, the capital of the Basque Country which was nominated European Green CAPITAL in 2012. In Vitoria-Gasteiz there is a major citizens movement in favor of local and organic food via short marketing chains . In the territory of Alava province organic production is increasing, driven largely by the urban demand of Vitoria-Gasteiz. The International Year of Family Farming, declared by UNO and implemented by FAO, reinforces this way of producing and keeping alive the rural world},

Developing methods to extract protein from forages could result in local feeds suitable for both ruminant and monogastric animals.There were 17 participants in field day,
from; Local farmers from animal  husbandry and organic feed farmers, Irrigation unions, Menemen Women Cooperative
 of Agriculture,  Organic Advisory Service, Agricultural engineers and  economists from Izmir, Provincial Directorate of  Agriculture and Forestry An Entrepreneur.Q ;How many times can you harvest organic lucerne and how many tones of fresh yield are obtained per hectare?
A; We cut organic lucerne seven or eight times a year. Although there is a slight decrease in yield in the first and last cut, on average, 17 
tons of fresh yield per cut was obtained. In total, you can have an idea about how much you can get when you multiply this yield by 7 or 8.
Q ; How much fertilizer did you apply?
A ; Lucerne develope rhizobia nodules on their roots thus we can say that they feed themselves, also enrich your soils. In other words 
lucerne provides its own fertilizer. That is why, we did not apply any fertilizer in to the soil. It is an important aspect in saving money. 
Q ; Your Project involves fractination techniques on protein and fiber rich feed. What potential benefits does the fractination provide for 
farmers?
A; The main objective of the project is new knowledge about fractionation techniques for forage legumes that will improve organic 
farmers? self-sufficiency with local feed, which means the dependency on imported protein feed will diminish in time. In regions where 
animal husbandry and crop production are geographically separated, the production of feed for monogastrics and ruminants from one 
crop may challenge farmers to find new ways of cooperating between farmers and possibly other stakeholders. This Project will stregthen 
such a cooperation in order to overcome this challenge},

Another target was to study the effect of potato cropping systems on the soil nutrient content.
The results of the 5 year study revealed that the cropping systems did not have any significant effect on the formation of potato yield components and the quality parameters of the tubers. It was concluded that soil nutrient content is of vital importance in potato cultivation because the crop harvest leaves the soil depleted of nutrients. By cultivating the potato in an organic field the soil potassium content was decreased by 15\%. It was also observed that the content of magnesium was limited after potato harvest. In order to compensate for the nutrient deficiency winter cover crops with high K and Mg binding properties and deep root systems should be used according to the specific cultivation site.},

The ranging score was significantly higher in rambutan orchard with 52 m-hr followed by the ranging score in grassland with 48 m-hr.  The ranging score was lowest in rice-based agroecosystem.

The differences in the ranging score among agroecosystem can be attributed mainly to the presence of trees as shade, the soil type, and the predominant weed species in each agroecosystem.  It was found that the higher the ranging score, the more the chicken used their daytime for the ranging acts i.e. ?kahig at tuka?.

As a result of ranging, there was a net decrease in weed biomass in all of the three agroecosystems.  This was indicative of the chickens feeding on the weeds.  The chickens showed preference for succulent and indeterminate grass species and rejection of paragrass and broad leaf weed species.

The results showed that organic farms (?All Organic?) mainly focus on the production of calves at weaning age which are fattened in conventional holdings (?Organic 1?; n= 22). The remaining organic farms (?Organic 2?; n=11) showed to participate in almost all stages of the agri-value chain. ?Conventional? farms were mainly dedicated to producing calves at weaning age (similarly to Organic 1).  Organic 1 had the smallest herd size: 80.18 LU, p{\ensuremath{<}}0.05). Organic 2 showed greater presence of indigenous breeds (62.08\%, p {\ensuremath{<}}0.05). Conventional farms proved to bear higher feed and veterinary costs per area (161.59 and 17.87 ? / ha; p {\ensuremath{<}}0.01 and p{\ensuremath{<}}0.05, respectively), but Organic 2 had higher feed costs per LU. Therefore, Conventional and All Organic were quite similar, and differences depended mainly on farm structure. Hence, being either conventional or organic does not seem to be a valid criterion for drawing conclusions regarding the benefits or characteristics of each system.},

However, they suffer from low competitiveness. In this sense, the design of improvement measures is needed. Due to this, this work has two objectives: (1) to assess the competitiveness of the beef pasture-based systems of the Spanish rangelands ('dehesas'); (2) to design improvement measures. For this purpose, a Competitiveness Index (CI) was created on the basis of technical and economic indicators. According to this index, farms were classified in three groups (1 = highly competitive but very dependent on subsidies; 2 = medium level of competitiveness; 3 = low competitiveness but low dependence on subsidies). Group 1 showed the highest scores for the CI (61.46\%), mainly due to their lower external dependence on feedstuff, their lower production costs, their larger amount of fattened calves sold per cow, and their high profitability rate. Group 2 had intermediate scores for the majority of indicators, as well as for the CI (49.20\%). However, Group 3 showed very low results for the economic indicators, they also showed the lowest dependence on subsidies, and the lowest scores for the CI (34.40\%). In general terms, the profitability rate, fattened calves sold por cow, and the dependence on subsidies are the issues on which farms' competitiveness mainly rely. In this sense, the increase of the self-sufficiency, the implementation of a fattening period, and the establishment of contracts with the next link of the agri-value chain must be encouraged in the farms analyzed.}

        abstract = {This paper analyzes the beef cattle sector located in the dehesa agro-ecosystem (SW Spain). The objective is to detect the more sustainable systems based on the environmental dimension of sustainability comparing three production models. RESULTS:  organic farms contribute to environmental stability to a greater extent than conventional ones due to the implementation of certain farming practices. Organic farms (mainly the 'Organic 2' group of farms) do not use pesticides nor chemical fertilizers and present greater integration of livestock species, crops and trees, which has positive environmental and economic effects. This integration allows better use of food resources and conservation of the heterogeneity of landscapes, conserving natural resources and promoting ecosystem services. Coupled with this, the reduced preventive use of parasiticides and antibiotics increases the resilience of livestock and reduce environmental pollution and antibiotic resistance. In this sense, organic farms (both 'Organic1' and 'Organic 2') showed the highest scores for sustainability. No significant differences were observed in manure management. This aspect was due to the extensification of dehesa farms, which prevents the accumulation of manure in a given area. Then grazing  lead to improving soil quality and reduces nutrient leaching. Regarding soil and crops management, any group of farms showed to carry out more environmentally agricultural practices (i.e. conservative agriculture, etc.). This could be due to poor training and awareness of managers with regard to this technical area, as well as an importance lack of association between crops and livestock. It has been observed that Organic 2 farms had higher scores than those belonging to both the Conventional and the Organic 1 groups. This reason was the higher proportion of wooded area in Organic 2 farms.  Finally, Organic 2 farms had the best scores with regard to both the use of autochthonous breeds and the integration of different livestock species.},

The present study characterizes such farms and assess their sustainability, as a tool to determine which farms present more feasibility to carry out a conversion to the organic system. This conversion could be used as a marketing tool for these farms, and contribute to local  development (both economically and socially), ensuring the maintenance of the farms and rural population while enabling the preservation of valuable landscapes.

METHODOLOGY: farms where classified using cluster analysis. Later, a sustainability assessment of the clusters (groups of farms) was carried out. Finally, farms' difficulties and advantages producing under the organic model where predicted. 

RESULTS and DISCUSSION: 3 groups of farms were obtained. Group 1 farms were intensive ones, using highly-productive dairy breeds fed high proportion of concentrates. Group 2 were semi-extensive of higher surface and mixed with sheeps, where autochthonous and allochthonous races are reared, and management is closer to a traditional one. Finally, group  3 was a traditional one, closer to the orgnaic management, with low stocking rates and native breeds feeding local feed resources.
Regarding the attributes of sustainability, group 3 showed advantages in terms of self-management, which is important under the organic system and areas of scarcity of feed resources (such as that studied).},

Moreover, the implementation of conservation agriculture practices proved to improve crop-livestock beneficial effects. This review paper aims at highlighting the scientific knowledge existing regarding the advantages and limitations of crop-livestock systems including agroforestry and conservation agriculture practices.

        abstract = {This chapter analyzes the sustainability of beef cattle systems of the Spanish Rangelands known as ?Dehesas?. These are traditional systems of the Iberian Peninsula where native herbaceous vegetation and evergreen species of Quercus provide the basis for extensive livestock farms. These systems are considered as outstanding High Nature Value (HNV) farming systems and the most extensive agroforestry systems in Europe according to CORINE Land Cover. 
Beef farms in this area show low stocking rates and a small dependence on foodstuff purchases.However, certain changes have occurred in the last decadesdue to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). On the one hand, some farms have become more intensified, as a way to maximize the revenues from the CAP subsidies. On the other hand, many farms have turned to organic production, trying to take advantage both of new subsidies and of new market trends.
In this regard, the organic livestock farming model is gaining weight as an option for sustainable production since, according to various authors, these systems have advantages over conventional and intensive systems. In fact, organic production in the area has increased substantially in recent years due to several factors, such as the growing interest of the EU towards preserving sensitive ecosystems, the potential role of organic production in the development of rural areas and the growing consumers? demand for safer and higher quality foods produced under ethical and environmental standards.
In this study, we carried out a comparative assessment of the sustainability of different conventional and organic beef production systems located in dehesa rangelands. The systems analyzed were classified as follows. (i) non-organic farms (Conventional); (ii) organic farms that sold calves at weaning age as conventional ones (Organic 1); (iii) organic farms that fattened and sold their calves as organic (Organic 2). An adaptation of the MESMIS multicriteria framework was applied to calculate sustainability indices for each system. The results showed that the Organic 2 farms scored highest on most of the attributes of sustainability, as well as on the environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability. Thus, they were the most sustainable system (66.55\%), followed by the Organic 1 (61.04\%) and Conventional ones (56.89\%). Despite Organic 2 was the most sustainable system, its implementation is complex due to both the high costs of organic inputs and the weak demand for organic beef. 
The results also showed that all three types of systems need to improve in certain aspects that are crucial in the current and future context of the livestock sector. These aspects are: reducing the dependence on external feed, implementing more environmentally friendly farming practices, and farm diversification.}

        abstract = {Legume crops such as peas (Pisum sativum L.) and faba beans (Vicia faba L.) have traditionally been grown for animal feed or for improving soil fertility and ensuring optimal nutrient availability for subsequent crops. This role is strongly driven by the capacity of legumes to conduct biological N2 fixation (BNF), which minimizes the requirement of external nitrogen fertilizer inputs. In recent decades, the production of legumes for human consumption has increased due to their potential as protein-rich raw materials and ingredients in plant-based diets. This transition places legumes in the center of future sustainable agri-food systems as high-value crops, but with this novel role follows strict requirements regarding food quality and safety. 

The yield stability and quality of legumes is highly dependent on the nutritional status of the plant during the growth season. Plants require 17 elements of the periodic table in order to complete a lifecycle. These include carbon, oxygen and hydrogen, which are derived from CO2 and soil water as well as 6 macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium, sulphur) and 8 micronutrients (iron, chloride, manganese, zinc, copper, boron, molybdenum, nickel). The macro- and micronutrients are all taken up by plant roots if being available in the right chemical form at the right time. In high-yielding agricultural systems fertilization strategies are carefully designed and managed to ensure optimal plant nutrient availability at critical time-points in the growth season. However, due to the ability of legumes to conduct BNF, optimization of fertilization strategies to legumes is rarely considered. It is thus very likely that many legume species are nutrient deficient, which potentially reduces the performance and quality of legume crops.  

Plant nutrients are the building block of all primary and secondary metabolites in plant tissue. However, the links between plant nutrition and food quality in legumes are poorly understood. Harvest yield and food quality parameters are rarely positively correlated and superior food quality may be obtained at nutrient supplies that are suboptimal or excessive for harvest yield. At the conference, results from ongoing research projects will be presented and the impact of plant nutrients and different fertilization strategies on legume performance and quality will be discussed.},

        abstract = {Background: 
Organic pig production is expanding and amongst the objectives of organic farming are enhancing animal health and welfare. However, some studies have reported a higher prevalence of lameness and joint condemnation at slaughter in free-range/organic pigs than in conventionally raised pigs. Organic slaughter pigs have free-range housing in which indoor and outdoor access is compulsory, while in conventional farming the pigs are commonly confined to indoor pens. The present study evaluated the effects of free-range and confined housing on lameness prevalence in a herd of 106 finisher pigs, and whether osteochondrosis and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae associated arthritis influences these effects. We also evaluated the association between clinical lameness during the rearing period and joint condemnations at slaughter. 
Results: 
Seventy free-range and 36 confined housed fattener pigs were scored for their gait twice during the rearing period and 848 joints were evaluated post mortem. Osteochondrosis was more frequent among free-range than confined pigs (P {\ensuremath{<}} 0.05), and when present it was also more severe (P {\ensuremath{<}} 0.001). Pigs with more numerous and more severe osteochondral lesions had their gait affected more than did pigs with fewer such lesions (P {\ensuremath{<}} 0.05). Hence it was a paradox that we did not detect more lameness among the free-range pigs than the confined pigs. E. rhusiopathiae associated arthritis was not diagnosed. The association between gait remarks/clinical lameness and joint condemnations at slaughter was not significant. 
Conclusions: 
The results indicate that free-range housing may have both positive and negative effects on locomotory traits. Free-range pigs may be less clinically affected by osteochondrosis than are confined pigs. One explanation for this effect may be strengthening of joint supportive tissue and pain relief promoted by exercise. Visual gait scoring missed serious joint lesions that probably were harmful to the pigs, and should therefore not be used as a sole indicator of joint/leg health in welfare inspection of pigs. The association between gait scores and joint condemnation appeared to be poor. This study was limited to one herd, and so more and larger studies on the effects of free-range housing on lameness severity and osteochondrosis development in pigs are recommended.

        abstract = {Background

Free-range housing, in which pigs have access to both indoor and outdoor areas, is mandatory in organic pig production in Europe, but little is known about the effects of this housing on joint health in pigs. A high level of joint condemnations at slaughter has been reported in organic free-range pigs in Sweden, compared with pigs raised in conventional confined housing. We hypothesised that biomechanical forces imposed on the joints of pigs that range freely promote the development of osteochondrosis and lead to joint condemnation. We compared the prevalence of osteochondrosis and other joint lesions (e.g. arthritis, traumatic) in the elbow and hock joints of 91 crossbred Hampshire (Yorkshire{$\times$}Landrace) fattening pigs that were housed in a free-range indoor/outdoor system with that in 45 pigs housed in confined indoor pens.
 
Results

A larger proportion of free-range than confined pigs had osteochondrosis in the elbow joints (69 vs. 50\%, p{\ensuremath{<}}0.05), and a higher proportion of these joints in free-range pigs showed moderate or severe lesions (33 vs. 16\%, p{\ensuremath{<}}0.05). The free-range pigs also showed a higher prevalence of osteochondrosis in the hock joints (83 vs. 62\%, p{\ensuremath{<}}0.05) and a larger proportion of these joints had moderate or severe lesions (69 vs. 33\%, p{\ensuremath{<}}0.001). At slaughter, 4.2\% of the free-range pigs had condemned joints, all of which showed severe osteochondrosis, while no joints of confined pigs were condemned. 

Conclusions

In this experiment the prevalence of osteochondrosis in the elbow and the hock was higher, and lesions were more severe, in free-range than in confined pigs, suggesting that free-range housing increases the risk of acquiring osteochondrosis. Increased biomechanical stress to vulnerable joint structures may be the mechanism behind this effect, however more studies are needed to verify these results. This study suggests that modification of housing, and breeding for joints that are more adapted to free-range movement may be needed in free-range pig production. Severe osteochondrosis is a cause of joint condemnation, but the condemnation rate at slaughter underestimates the actual frequency of joint lesions and hence is a poor assessment of joint health.

However, the mode of preparation and application of these plants parts require different methods. These traditional remedies are more preferred because they are locally available, cheaper, safer and effective compared to the orthodox veterinary medicines.

This study investigated agricultural students? perception of organic farming in selected universities, south western Nigeria. Simple random technique was used to select 258 respondents for the study. Data on sources of information, awareness, knowledge and perception of organic farming as well as constraints to organic farming were collected through the use of structured questionnaires. Data were analysed using frequency counts, mean, Chi-square, PPMC and ANOVA. The study revealed that Farm year programme (58.9\%) was the most preferred source of information on organic farming and majority of the respondents (77.5\%) were highly aware of organic farming. Most of the respondents (62\%) had high knowledge of organic farming. However, the use of organic farming  was low among many (55\%) of the respondents while inadequate storage facilities (48.1\%) was the most severe constraint against organic farming in the study area. Many of the respondents (51.6\%) had fairly favourable perception of organic farming. Universities (x2=0.021, p= 0.018), department of respondents (x2=0.01, p=0.020), Knowledge (r=0.216, p=0.000) and constraints (r=0.189, p=0.002) were significantly related to perception of organic farming. Respondents were fairly favourably disposed to organic farming. However, the use of organic farming practices was being hindered by inadequate storage facilities. Efforts should be concentrated on providing storage facilities and other support services to further enhance the sustainability of the organic farming initiative among the respondents.

This is leading to depletion of soil organic matter, severely threatening soil fertility and damaging soil structure. In the worst cases, crops hardly yield anything anymore, even with the addition of chemical fertilizers. In Burkina Faso, some farming families have found ways to restore their soil productive capacity through the use of low external input practices, based on mulch application of branches and leaves from local flora. The techniques described in this article are relevant for organic farming systems as they rely mainly on locally-available resources and diminish the addition of external inputs to the system. 
Although third party certification of organic family farming in the study zone is non-existent, the innovation dubbed 'slash and mulch' may be an important practice to up-scale organic frameworks and eventually promote organic certification through partnerships between farmers. Developing locally suited practices based on farmer innovations is a key component for the widespread of organic schemes and promotion of ecologically-sound techniques.},

Advancements toward the imitation of dryland forest floors to restore agricultural soils in the Sahel, a form of ?ecosystem mimicry? (Ewel, 1999), can be achieved via the intensive application of carbon-rich mulches. Therefore, strategies are needed to restore and maintain soil productivity via greater inputs of organic matter, greater water retention, reduced evaporation and runoff, increased soil biological diversity, and nutrient cycling and availability. Indigenous forms of agroforestry based on the use of local shrubs, as practiced by farmers, offer opportunities to design sustainable farming systems that are based on agroecological principles and can contribute to building resilience and adaptability in the face of climate change.},

Responsible for our food, our rural communities, our countryside, our health, our environment and our farmers, the CAP affects everyone. 
It is widely acknowledged that the CAP has encouraged a model of agriculture that damages the environment ? contributing to climate change, biodiversity loss, soil erosion and water pollution ? and has promoted factory-style farming at the expense of viable incomes for farmers and jobs in rural areas. A strong commodity-orientated production has increased imports of cheap rawmaterials produced in socially and environmentally damagingways, and cheap exports to the global south which means that the CAP's impact is felt much further afield than in the EU alone. Yet, despite reforms over past decades, so far the CAP has not gone far enough to support or stimulate food sovereignty and agroecological approaches. 
This needs to change urgently and it requires better CAP implementation across the European Union.}

        abstract = {The extraction of proteins from leaves, integrated in a green biorefinery, may represent an attractive solution to the increasing demand for protein-rich animal feeds while decreasing the dependency on soybean imports. Thereby such green biorefineries could contribute to the development of more self-sufficient and sustainable agricultural systems in Europe. The framework of this PhD study is a green biorefinery concept for the production of protein concentrate, biogas and fertilizer from organic and locally grown green crops like alfalfa, clover or grass. After the screw pressing of the fresh crops, lactic acid fermentation of the green juice with Lactobacillus salivarius BC 1001 was assessed as the key method for the recovery of proteins. A leaf protein concentrate suited as protein feed for monogastric animals is produced, while using a process that is in agreement with the organic production guidelines. In laboratory trials, overall protein recoveries from 12\% up to 42\% of total plant proteins were achieved in the leaf protein concentrate. The leaf protein concentrates presented relatively high protein contents up to 46\% DM, balanced amino acid compositions compared with soybeans and high proportions of essential amino acids for pigs and poultry. Anaerobic co-digestion of the process side stream fractions i.e. press cake and brown juice in the same ratio at which these fractions leave the biorefinery after protein extraction, could recover around 65\% of the methane potential in the fresh crops. The protein biorefining process was also evaluated in a demonstration scale plant, processing 444 tons of freshly harvested clover grass continuously during four days and producing 1 ton of dried protein concentrate and 7 tons of protein paste, to be evaluated in large-scale animal feeding trials with laying hens. Besides, the influence of the development stage of the plants over the process yields, protein extractability and production of leaf protein concentrate was investigated. Results indicated that the overall extraction of proteins was reduced with maturity of the plants, and for this reason flowering should be avoided to optimize the production of leaf protein concentrates. Altogether, research outcomes from this study are relevant for the production of protein concentrates from locally grown crops and for further development of green biorefineries in Denmark.}

In this context, a Danish project called Organofinery is focusing on developing a green biorefinery platform for the production of organic protein-rich feed for monogastric animals, of biogas and of organic fertilizer.
In the Organofinery concept, the freshly harvested green biomass is separated by a screw press into a green juice and a press cake. Soluble sugars contained in the green juice are fermented by specific lactic acid bacteria, leading to a drop of the pH and triggering protein precipitation. The resulting protein concentrate is purely organic and rich in non-denatured proteins, making it a high-value protein feed product for organic farming. The residual press cake and brown juice after protein extraction are tested to be used as feedstock for biogas production and subsequent use as organic fertilizer.
Protein extraction yields in the protein product were in the range of 15 to 23\% for various green crops such red clover, clover grass or alfalfa. On average, the protein concentrates contained 18\% dry matter and 35-40 \% true protein (dry weight). Therefore, up to 10 kg dry protein product can be produced from 1 ton of fresh green biomass by the Organofinery process. Moreover, the organic protein concentrates showed high content of sulfur amino acids, which are regarded as important amino acids in diets for monogastric animals.  
Protein processing will be tested in pilot scale in June 2016. Around 200 tons of freshly harvested clover grass will be processed in the Organofinery concept to produce 2 tons of dry protein product. Afterwards, a full feeding experiment with egg-laying hens will be performed in order to assess the safety and quality of the protein product as organic protein feed for monogastric animals. 
The conducted experiments have shown the potential of the Organofinery concept and the imminent pilot scale experiment should proof its applicability to provide protein-rich feed for the farming sector.},

        abstract = {The scarce availability of organic animal feed for monogastric animals is hindering the development of organic farming in many regions. A green biorefinery platform called OrganoFinery aims at producing organic protein-rich animal feed based on organically grown green biomass. The freshly harvested green biomass is separated into a solid fraction (press cake) and a liquid fraction (green juice). Subsequently, the green juice is inoculated with specific lactic acid bacteria which ferment the soluble sugars into lactic acid triggering a pH drop and thus, the precipitation of proteins. Last, proteins are extracted by centrifugation and the organic protein concentrate is suitable for feeding monogastric animals. 
Green perennial crops can be harvested several times during a season. In the present study, the impact of the development stage of the plant biomass, exemplified by red clover, at harvesting time for the protein extraction yield was assessed in order to develop a harvesting strategy. Red clover was harvested at different developmental stages i.e. early stem elongation, late stem elongation and heading. Right after harvest, the fresh biomass was processed to produce a protein concentrate as described above. 
The green juices presented higher concentration of soluble proteins and soluble sugars with increasing maturity. After 10 hours fermentation, the pH dropped from 5.9-6.0 to 3.9-4.0 in all green juice samples and the lactic acid concentration reached up to 20.6 g/L. The highest lactic acid concentration (20.6 g/L) was achieved for the late maturity stage and was 1.5 higher than in the early maturity stage. Differences due to the development stage were also observed in the recovery of proteins from the green juice into the protein concentrate. Indeed, the recovery of proteins from the green juice was between 70-80\% of the content in the green juice and with the highest values obtained for the late maturity stage. 
The relevance of this study relies on the fact that the harvesting strategy is crucial in order to maximize the protein yield from green biomass and, to develop an economically viable green biorefinery platform to produce organic protein-rich feed for monogastric animals.}

Anaerobic digestion of the residual streams after protein separation for the organic feed product is a key process to extract both the energetic and the nutritional value of the residual biomass in the biorefinery. Biogas potentials of the residual streams from the processing of red clover and clover grass (press cake obtained from screw pressing to produce green juice and brown juice after precipitation of protein concentrate from the green juice) where determined in batch and reactor experiments and a mass balance of the nutrients was established based on analysis of N, P, K, and S from the different process stages of the concept. The AD process was tested in lab-scale both as co-digestion of press cake and brown juice in a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and of the brown juice alone in an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor. Both reactor processes showed stable performance without signs of inhibition or nutrient deficiency. The methane yields, the nutritional value of the digestates from these experiments as well as the mass balances for the whole process will be presented.
In mesophilic co-digestion (50:50 ratio based on VS) of press cake and brown juice from red clover at 20d hydraulic retention time (HRT) methane yields of 237 to 283 L-CH4/kg-VS were achieved while mesophilic treatment of brown juice from clover grass in the high-rate reactor yielded on average 202 L-CH4/kg-VS at 3 days HRT. 
For red clover, concentrations of N, P, K and S were 5.07, 0.45, 4.58, and 0.25 g/-kg-biomass, respectively while the values for these nutrients were 2.97, 0.40, 5.51, and 0.23 g/-kg-biomass for clover grass. After screw press separation and protein precipitation of red clover 52, 53, 43 and 52\% of the respective nutrient input were left in the press cake while 15, 30, 38, and 13\% were found in the brown juice. After processing of clover grass it was 60, 56, 39 and 55\% of the respective nutrient input left in the press cake while it was 11, 27, 31, and 26\% in the brown juice. Nitrogen in the digestate from the co-digestion process with 20 days HRT was made more bioavailable with an increase of the share of NH4+-N of total-N from 13\% to 62\%. During 3 days HRT in the UASB process this effect was much lower with only an increase from 11\% to 16\%.}

The indicators used for the soil quality evaluation were: earthworm's abundance, root's density, soil compaction score obtained with spade test, bulk density, soil penetration resistance and chemical analysis. Data were collected from November 2015 to September 2017, then statistical analysis, based on ANOVA test, was performed. 
Main results show that conventional system is more productive than organic and there is not significant difference between plowing and reduced tillage operations regarding yield; earthworms are more abundant under reduced tillage; root's density is about 20\% higher in organic soils but phosphorous decreased by about 40\% in 25 years.},

aufzuhalten und eine zukunftsf{\"a}hige Landwirtschaft betreiben zu k{\"o}nnen musste ein Umdenken in der Beziehung zwischen Verbrauchern und Landwirten stattfinden. Aus dieser Bewegung entstand die Idee der Community Supported Agriculture. Eine Vertragslandwirtschaft zwischen Verbrauchern und Landwirten, die auch auf die Grundlagen des {\"O}kologischen Landbaus zur{\"u}ckgreift.
In den USA ist die Idee der CSA bereits weit verbreitet und wird auf vielen H{\"o}fen angewendet. In L{\"a}ndern wie Deutschland hat diese Art der Landwirtschaft jedoch keinen gro{\ss}en Bekanntheitsgrad. Um dies zu {\"a}ndern ist es notwendig, vermehrt {\"u}ber CSA zu informieren und interessierten Menschen M{\"o}glichkeiten zur Vernetzung zu bieten. Durch die Vernetzung k{\"o}nnen sich neue Communities bilden, die dann CSA-H{\"o}fe gr{\"u}nden. Als ideales
Medium f{\"u}r diese Ziele bietet sich in der heutigen Zeit das Internet an. Es erreicht so gut wie jeden Menschen egal welchen Alters oder sonstigen Status.
Diese Arbeit setzt genau hier an. Denn Ziel dieser Arbeit ist die Konzeption und Entwicklung von Inhalten f{\"u}r eine
geplante Informationswebsite {\"u}ber CSA. Die geplante Website ist Teil eines vom B{\"O}LN gef{\"o}rderten Projektes, was die Verbreitung des {\"O}kologischen Landbaus durch die CSA beinhaltet.
Die Zielsetzung bez{\"u}glich der Inhalte wurde mit den Projektpartnern vorab besprochen. Die Aufgabe dieser Arbeit wurde dann durch eine umfangreiche Literatur- und Internetrecherche auf nationaler und internationaler Ebene bearbeitet. Es wurde eine Navigation erarbeitet, die zuk{\"u}nftig auf der geplanten Website ?Make CSA? wegweisend sein kann.
In Deutschland sollte eine einheitliche Verwendung des Begriffes Community Supported Agriculture entstehen. Dies w{\"u}rde die Verbreitung und Vernetzung von Informationen im internationalen Raum einfacher gestalten.
Im Laufe der Arbeit wird klar, wie wichtig die Informations- und Vernetzungsarbeit ist, um die Ausbreitung der Idee von der Community Supported Agriculture zu f{\"o}rdern. Denn innovative Ideen brauchen Hilfen; und eine m{\"o}gliche Hilfe bietet zuk{\"u}nftig diese Website.},

Der Hauptunterschied zwischen biologisch-dynamischem und konventionellem Anbau liegt in der Art der D{\"u}nung und im Pflanzenschutz. Sowohl im zeitlichen Verlauf als auch {\"u}ber die Tiefe ergab sich in den B{\"o}den f{\"u}r das biologisch-dynamische Verfahren eine h{\"o}here Menge an organischer Substanz, eine h{\"o}here mikrobielle Biomasse wie auch eine h{\"o}here Bodenrespiration. Der Anteil des mikrobiellen Kohlenstoffs (Cmic) am gesamten organischen Kohlenstoffvorrat (Corg) des Bodens war in biologisch-dynamischen bewirtschafteten B{\"o}den um 22 \% h{\"o}her als im konventionell bearbeiteten Boden. Dies ist ein Hinweis auf die bessere mikrobielle Verwertbarkeit der organischen Substanz im biologisch-dynamischen Anbau. Die organische Substanz und die mikrobielle Biomasse nahmen mit der Tiefe in beiden Verfahren deutlich ab, w{\"a}hrend die Bodenatmung kaum einen Tiefengradienten aufwies. In den sp{\"a}teren Wintermonaten war die mikrobielle Biomasse beider Verfahren deutlich erh{\"o}ht, ansonsten blieb die mikrobielle Biomasse im Jahresverlauf weitgehend konstant. Bodenbiologische Kenngr{\"o}ssen, wie der Gehalt an mikrobieller Biomasse und die Bodenrespiration, die als Indikatoren der Bodenfruchtbarkeit diskutiert werden, zeigen, dass sich die biologische Landwirtschaft nicht nur auf die bearbeitete Bodenschicht direkt auswirkt, sondern auch auf jene Bodenschichten positiv Einfluss nimmt, die unter dem Pflughorizont liegen. },

Crop yields from Danish field trials with alfalfa, clover and grass-clover mixtures demonstrate average yields around 12 tons dry matter per hectare yielding on average 700 kg extracted protein per hectare and 3000 to 6000 m3 methane per hectare. With these yields the profitability of biorefining of organic protein feed is calculated and shows a positive economic result, especially when used as wet-feed saving the cost for drying.

        abstract = {Cover crops (CC) may play an essential role in the recycling of nutrients in organic farming systems with cereals.
Harvest time of cereals and management of straw in the field can affect the growth of CC and subsequent
nitrogen (N) fertiliser replacement value (NFRV) in the following crop. This study investigates 1) the effect of
harvest time, 2) cutting height of straw and 3) straw removal from the main crop on CC growth, composition,
uptake and NFRV in the following crop and 4) the effect of CC harvest in autumn on the NFRV in the succeeding
crop.
A CC mixture of mainly red clover, with chicory and ryegrass was sown under a spring barley crop in 2017,
and replicated in 2018. Four strategies of barley harvest were conducted: 1) early harvest as whole crop or 2)
early harvest of the upper parts only, 3) at maturity with straw removed or 4) at maturity with straw left on the
field surface. Subsequently, CC and high stubbles of left straw were harvested and removed in autumn in half of
the field replicates. The residual effect was measured in spring barley in the succeeding year.
The CC aboveground biomass dominated by the clover had an N uptake for both years of 40?77 kg N ha?1.
Variability was significant between years but not caused by the harvest time or by straw management. In the
succeeding year, residues from barley and CC could replace 61?85 kg N ha?1 of mineral N fertiliser, which were
mostly derived from CC roots and stubble. High straw stubble left (40 cm length) significantly reduced the NFRV
of CC shoots by 20\%.
Root residues (including barley and CC roots) contributed a substantial N supply to the following crop irrespective
of aboveground CC biomass. The availability of N derived from CC shoot mineralisation differed
significantly in the two years and was also influenced by straw left from the previous crop.}

However, farmyard manure and Kali vinasse proved effective sources of K to grass and clover in the short to medium term. Available P (measured as Olsen-P) showed no clear relationship with crop P offtake in these trials. In contrast, available K (measured by ammonium nitrate extraction) proved a useful measurement to predict K availability to crops and support K management decisions.},

        abstract = {This project OF0190 was an extension to OF0125 to cover completing the comparison data for 1997/98 and to extend the data collection by one further year (1998/99). The final reports for the two projects are therefore being submitted jointly. The OF0125 report covers the period 1995/96-1997/98, for which a detailed report was submitted to MAFF in July 1999, and a revised detailed report including a complete set of comparisons with conventional farms was submitted to MAFF, after revisions, in July 2000. That report has now been published at www.organic.aber.ac.uk/library/organic farm incomes.pdf. A detailed report for 1998/99 has been submitted to MAFF in March 2001, and will be published at the same internet site once accepted.

The report presents results from research work carried out for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) on the financial performance of organic farms in 1998/99.  The aim of the research was to assess the financial performance of organic farms differentiated by farm type, in order to inform MAFF policy-making with respect to organic farming, and to provide a basis for assessments by farmers, advisers and other interested parties of the farm-level implications of conversion to and continued organic farming.  To provide an idea of the trends over time, where possible data for continuous samples of farms are presented for 1997/98 and 1998/99. 

The specific objectives were to extend the previous project (OF0125, covering 1995/96 to 1997/98) to collect and collate data on the financial performance of organic farms, differentiated by farm type .  This was achieved through the collation of financial data collected under three different MAFF-funded research projects supplemented by data collected on other farm types.  The samples of organic farms are small because of the limited number of organic holdings over 8 ESU (European Size Units) with identifiable holding numbers in 1996, when the previous study was started. As the sample is small there is limitation on how the results may be extrapolated to the wider population of organic farms, especially as the structure and objectives of those converting to organic production in the late 1990s may be different from those that converted in the 1970s and 1980s. 
 
Detailed financial input, output, income, liabilities and assets and some physical performance measures are presented for 1998/99.  Where an identical sample of five farms is available, data are presented for 1997/98 and 1998/99 for the sample.

The organic farm samples are so small that outliers (especially larger farms) have a large influence on the average.  If the samples were larger, general trends would be more apparent and less influenced by individual farms; despite this, some explanation has been attempted of trends and changes in inputs, outputs and incomes.  However, great care must be taken in extrapolating results. 
 
Of those farm types for which a continuous identical sample of five farms was available, Net Farm Incomes (NFI) increased for cropping ({\pounds}281/ha) and dairy farms ({\pounds}487/ha) in 1998/99 compared with 1997/98; in both cases outputs as well as inputs increased between years.  Mixed farms showed an average reduction in outputs and increase in inputs, lowering the average NFI to {\pounds}15/ha in 1998/99.  The five lowland cattle and sheep farms improved a negative NFI of {\pounds}161/ha in 1997/98 to a positive {\pounds}7/ha in 1998/99 through an increase in livestock outputs with a similar level of inputs to that of 1997/98.

Due to the high level of farmer and spouse labour on horticultural holdings, the average Management and Investment Income (MII) of the sample was negative, but the average NFI was {\pounds}1,836/ha.  On four holdings, 1998/99 average outputs were 92\%, and inputs were 97\% of the previous year, resulting in an average NFI in 1998/99 for that group of 75\% of the 1997/98 result.
The group of LFA farms, consisting of four cattle and sheep and one mixed farm, achieved an average NFI of {\pounds}72/ha in 1998/99.

This report presents results from research work carried out for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) on the financial performance of organic farms over the years 1995/96 to 1997/98. The aim of the research was to assess the financial performance of organic farms differentiated by farm type, in order to inform MAFF policy-making with respect to organic farming, and to provide a basis for assessments by farmers, advisers and other interested parties of the farm-level implications of conversion to, and continued organic farming.
The specific objectives were the provision of information on different organic farm types. This was achieved through the collation of financial data collected under three different MAFF-funded research projects supplemented by data collected on other farm types, including data on dairy farms in the process of converting to organic production. Organic farm data is presented for LFA cattle and sheep farms for 1997/98 only. The samples of organic farms are small because of the limited number of organic holdings over 8 European Size Units with identifiable holding numbers in 1996 and farms with more than 50\% of their land under organic management in 1997/98.
Although the organic sample is small, it represents nearly 14\% of organic farms with identifiable holding numbers registered with UKROFS in 1996, and this work gives an indication of the relative profitability of different organic and conventional farms of different types in the late 1990s.
Detailed financial input, output, income, liabilities and assets and some physical performance measures are presented for each of the years studied.
Outputs on organic dairy, horticulture and mixed farms increased each year. Outputs on organic lowland cattle and sheep farms were stable, but increasing inputs reduced Net Farm Income (NFI) each year in the study period. Outputs from organic cropping farms increased in 1996/97 and decreased in 1997/98, but results from this group are affected by the high levels of conventional cropping (25\% of land area on average) and reduced conventional prices.
To provide an indication of the likely performance of the organic farms if they were under conventional production, data from conventional farms are given. Conventional farms were selected by cluster analysis from the Farm Business Survey (FBS) (MAFF, 1999)1.
In 1997/98 the average NFI ({\pounds}/farm) of the organic farms exceeded that of the conventional farms for all farm types except cattle and sheep farms.},

        abstract = {Bridging the large gap between science and experience of farmers is a crucial focus for educators who are intent on developing learning programs featuring phenomenology and practical experiences. Agroecology is emerging as an integrative and holistic approach to study agricultural and food systems. Understanding lessons learned from indigenous systems and the ecological principles on which they are built, focusing on the uniqueness of place in design and practice of farming, shifting from a discipline-specific to a holistic systems perspective, and integrating the human dimension into study of farming and food systems are all essential to building effective bridges between farmer experience and science as we practice this in university research and education. Key farmer applications in organic farming, multiple cropping systems, permaculture, and integrated crop/animal systems provide useful teaching examples that help students to bridge the space between theory and practice. On-farm learning and discussions with farmers help to build awareness of how to improve communication as part of the bridging process, and to build student confidence in how to more easily work with stakeholders in the future. One useful perspective is to pursue learning in agroecology as an analysis and application of the ecology of food systems, one that includes production, economics, environmental impacts, and social implications in future systems design. Each of these dimensions is explored in this paper, building on experiences of more than a decade of teaching in agroecology at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (UMB). }

        abstract = {In the period 2002-2004, the Netherlands Government's Pin-Matra programme funded an international project aiming to support the introduction of an agri-environment (AE) programme in Croatia. The project resulted in proposals for national and pilot agri-environment programmes. This publication summarises the proposal for the Pilot  project. 

The Agri-Environment Programme is an integral part of the EU Rural Development Regulation (1257/1999). It is the only obligatory measure under this regulation. The programme sets up the framework for the comprehensive protection of the environment and nature from adverse agricultural practices. The programme is based on voluntary agreements between farmers and public authorities. By providing economic incentives and supporting related education and demonstration activities, the programme encourages and enables farmers to employ agricultural practices that are beneficial for nature and the environment. The agri-environment programme has recorded very rapid expansion.  Currently some 25\% of EU agricultural land is included in the agri-environment programme. The costs of the AE programmes are partly financed from the EU budget and partly from national budgets. The AE schemes have become an important policy instrument for protecting the environment and maintaining biodiversity on EU agricultural land. 

Croatia still does not have an agri-environment programme. Therefore,  it was proposed to select a Croatian protected natural area and design a pilot agri-environment programme for it. The {\v Z}umberak-  Samoborsko Gorje Nature Park was selected because in this region agriculture is essential for maintaining the basic Park phenomena: a man-made mosaic landscape and biodiversity depending on traditional land use. Besides, data needed to design an AE programme were available and the Park management team was highly professional and motivated.

The {\v Z}umberak-Samoborsko Gorje Nature Park represents a cultural landscape created through human activities, which shaped the landscape and contributed to the enrichment of biodiversity. Human activity, particularly grazing and mowing, created the conditions for the existence of many wildlife species. Over the last decades, and especially in the 1990s, livestock farming has been seriously declining in the Park. As a result, many species-rich grasslands are no longer managed and are overgrowing with shrubs and trees.

The Agri-environment programme for the {\v Z}umberak-Samoborsko Gorje Nature Park is designed to respond to the rapid decline of landscape, habitats and species diversity due to the loss of agricultural land, notably grassland. The Programme will encourage farmers to continue practising environmentally friendly measures or introduce those that are not economically attractive, but essential from the environmental and biodiversity point of view. 
The proposed schemes and packages consists of four schemes:
1. The Information Transfer Scheme 
It should provide training to farmers, administrators and extensionists, as well as inform general public on the Programme importance.
2. Abandoned Land Clearance Scheme 
This Scheme should enable farmers to clean and restore agricultural land overgrown by shrubs.
3. Species Rich Grassland Scheme
It encourages farmers to continue with traditional (extensive) grassland management enabling maintenance of species rich grassland. The Scheme has two packages: for mowing and grazing.  
4. Biodiversity Scheme
This consists of three packages: the Traditional Fruit Trees Package, Wild Species Protection Package and Ponds Package. These are targeted to improve habitat, species and landscape biodiversity.

Participation in the AE Programme is granted to all farmers having at least 1 ha of agricultural land within the Park borders. Exempted from this rule are the farms participating in the Wild Species Protection Package, whose size can be smaller than 1 hectare. The Park Authority may also be a recipient of the Programme's aid. Since this kind of programme is quite new and has never been tested in the Park, it is very difficult to forecast the number of farmers and the land area that will enrol in the Programme. The following estimate has been made for the first three years of the Programme:
Abandoned Land Clearance Scheme: 800 hectares. This area represents 20\% of the currently estimated abandoned grassland area. 
Species Rich Grassland Scheme: 2,000 hectares. 
This is equal to 20\% of the total Park grassland area. 
Biodiversity Scheme: 400 hectares and 10 km under linear habitats. The Traditional Fruit Trees Package is expected to cover 100 hectares of meadow orchards, The Wild Species Protection Package is most likely to cover some 300 hectares and The Ponds Package is expected to involve 10 ponds. 
The Information Transfer Scheme: is to provide training for some 1000 farmers, a number of local agronomists, environmentalists and Park experts. The Scheme will also provide information on the Programme to the Park's inhabitants and visitors.
The uptake is expected to record an annual increase in the first years of the Programme's implementation. The envisaged cost for the first three years of the AE Programme's implementation is 400.000 EUR per year on average. Once Croatia joins the EU, the AE Programme could be 85\% financed by the EU and 15\% by the national agricultural budget. 

While designing and starting with the implementation of a national AE programme takes time, the pilot AE programme can be tested in a relatively short period. The {\v Z}umberak Samoborsko Gorje Nature Park AE Programme would test several AE measures. Experiences and lessons that could be learned from it would be beneficial both for designing the national AE programme and similar region-specific AE  programmes. 

Reaching the targets set out by this Programme would enhance the rural landscape, protect the environment and improve biodiversity. By encouraging farmers to continue with appropriate agricultural management the Programme will significantly contribute to preventing any further decline of landscape, habitats and species diversity in the Park.

        abstract = {Pluriactivity in organic farming in Denmark, and its implications for intensity of farming- and nature practises. 
Societal demands to the farming sector are changing, from solely focussing on foodproduction to an increased interest in the production of environmental and nature values, as well as a socio-economically sustainable countryside. Coincident with this development agricultural restructuring takes place with high speed, implying structural development: fewer and larger farms. Meanwhile some farming households seek alternative pathways, including diversification of activities and use of resources. These pathways sometimes express alternative development choices other than farm intensification. A crucial question is thus, if some of these alternative developments are well suited to deliver those multifunctional values demanded, ? and may be eligible to more attention from the policy-side.
 
Organic agriculture (OA) has been identified as one of the pathways forming the agricultural restructuring. OA represents a whole-farm approach to natural resource management, aiming for an integration of production goals, environmental goals and goals for nature management and protection. 
Among others one of the common goals for OA is that biodiversity in farmland and adjacent areas must not be compromised. However the ways this goal manifest itself in the practice of OA in different socio-economic and biophysical contexts are quite varied. It is thus interesting if the label of organic farming cover a wide variety of household strategies, and if this on the other hand implies a variety of farming and nature practises.

We explore this variation within OA in Denmark. Based on interviews of app. 10\% of organic farmers selected to represent major landscape types and farm types, we explore relationships between traditional farm types, full-time/part-time farming, non-agricultural on-farm activities, off-farm activities, farm size and regional context. Moreover we relate these aspects to farmers? nature practice, represented by area and management intensity of permanent grassland fields and small, uncultivated areas on the farm.

        abstract = {The current environmental, social, and economic challenges of food systems necessitate actions towards more sustainable consumption patterns and production approaches. Reducing animalsource food (ASF) intake is a promising strategy to solve multiple sustainability issues. However, how many and which animals could be part of a sustainable food system remains up for discussion, as well as how the remaining ASF should best be produced. This thesis aimed to investigate the role of ASF in current and potential future food systems, with special emphasis on integrating different sustainability impacts. We conducted a literature review to understand why certain ASF are proposed as solutions for more sustainable diets. There, we found that studies considering statusquo impact assessments and specifying consumption-oriented scenarios recommend to reduce beef and pork rather than chicken. In these studies, the role of ASF is mostly limited to current production practices and feed food competition is not addressed. Studies considering systemic consequences and specifying resource-oriented scenarios propose larger reductions of chicken and pork, because these are produced with more food-competing feed. In these latter studies, the role of animals and the resulting ASF is mostly limited to converting low-opportunity-cost biomass, thereby avoiding feed-food competition. In future research and communication of more sustainable dietary solutions, these choices and the resulting consequences should be considered to enable effective communication and policy design. Further, we assessed environmental and socio economic impacts of current dietary choices in Switzerland, and related these to different sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Our results showed that while nationalities, language regions, age groups, and smoking status seemed particularly distinctive, income or educational groups seemed hardly relevant. Food choices and the resulting sustainability impacts thus markedly differed between these factors, suggesting that these can be relevant, for example, to target nutrition campaigns. Then, we assessed environmental and socio-economic impacts of different consumer strategies for Switzerland, including dietary changes as well as production-side changes. While the dietary changes towards more plant-based diets improved the environmental performance, diet quality, and diet cost, these changes increased social risks. Moreover, increased share of organic agriculture had ambivalent effects on the environmental performance. When enhanced with circularity principles, however, all environmental indicators improved substantially. Consequently, we assessed the nutritional and environmental consequences of integrating animal-source food recommendations with circularity principles, both in national dietary guidelines (Bulgaria, Malta, Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland) and for the EAT-Lancet dietary guidelines. While for the latter, ASF protein of the recommendations could be met, we found this not to be feasible for the national guidelines assessed. Nevertheless, considering circularity aspects in dietary guidelines by linking the types of ASF to available low-opportunity-cost biomass offers large potential to improve the resource use efficiency in food systems, and simultaneously improving environmental performance. In conclusion, the role of ASF in more sustainable food systems can be manifold ? and depends largely on the required nutritional contributions as well as on defined priorities for different dimensions of sustainability. Importantly, to thoroughly assess the role and potential of ASF for improved sustainability, adequate methods need to be used and adopting a systems-level analysis going beyond product-specific efficiency measures is unavoidable.},

M{\r a}let med prosjektet i 2020 var {\r a} belyse tallens egnethet for plantevekst. Tallen fra drivhusfj{\o}set ble luftet daglig under komposteringen og var relativt homogen. Dyrkingsmedia tjener flere fysiske, kjemiske og biologiske funksjoner for plantevekst. Innhold av n{\ae}ringsstoffer er ogs{\r a} viktig, men trenger ikke komme fra dyrkingsmediet; det kan ogs{\r a} tilf{\o}res i l{\o}pet av vekstsesongen som fast eller flytende gj{\o}dsel. 
Tallens fysiske og kjemiske egenskaper ble unders{\o}kt og beskrevet og funnet egnet for plantevekst. Spiretest med karse ga d{\r a}rlig resultat. Det betyr at tallen ikke egnet seg til oppal av sm{\r a}planter eller direktes{\r a}ing av vekster. Tallens modenhet ble overraskende vurdert som d{\r a}rligere i 2020 enn i 2018. Innholdet av n{\ae}ringsstoffer i tallen var ganske lik i de to {\r a}rene. Kaliuminnholdet taler for {\r a} bruke tallen som gj{\o}dsel eller jordforbedring ved kaliumkrevende kulturer som potet eller tomat. Uten ekstra tilf{\o}rsel av n{\ae}ringsstoffer var tallen best egnet som jordforbedring.}

The composting is performed in a combined stable and greenhouse directly in the deep litter which is a mixture of cow manure and wood chips ? a compost barn. This method is known in USA, Israel and the Netherlands. A newly constructed compost barn with 18 suckle cows was followed by four visits and samplings during 2017 and 2018. The focus was on compost quality for growth media and the plant growth performance. During summertime, when cattle were outdoors, tomato Lycopersicum esculentum, pumpkin Cucurbita maxima and squash Cucurbita pepo were cultivated. Compost was analysed for nutrients at the beginning and the end of season. Compost maturity was evaluated using different standards and methods such as sprout inhibitions, the Solvita?method and sensory assessment.
The results showed a high compost pH. The compost C:N ratio was reasonable for plant cultivation but, it could be lower by letting the compost mature for more time. The temperature in the compost during the composting process was lower than expected. The evaluation of compost maturity indicated stable and mature compost. The challenge of cultivation directly in the compost seems achievable. During the first growing season, the compost seemed too moist and consequently there was a sciarid Sciaridae spp. flie plague. During the second season, the compost seemed too dry and consequently attracted mould. According to the farmers, the management of cattle using this system was comparable to conventional management in terms of the time and effort required. Animal welfare was no issue. A suggestion to improve compost quality is to add more woodchips from broadleaved trees to reduce the compost pH. It was concluded that using compost barns as greenhouses is promising and could be implemented in agroecological systems.}

        abstract = {This is the final report of Defra project OF0149

1.	The report reviews the impact of different farming regimes and makes a comparative study of their influence on the biodiversity of arable farmland.

2.	Within this review, the evaluation of impacts on biodiversity focuses on species and habitats, and includes both the number, abundance and activity of species (section 1.3).

3.	Five farming regimes are defined and discussed, namely Conventional Arable, Conventional Mixed Lowland, Organic and two integrated production regimes - LEAF (Linking Environment and Farming) and IFS-Experimental regimes  The main differences between the regimes in relation to the use of external inputs and other agricultural practices are discussed.  The review draws on both UK and European information (section 1.4). 

4.	The effect of each farming regime on biodiversity is assessed according to the agricultural practices adopted and to the occurrence and management of uncropped land present.  Agricultural practices are reviewed within the following categories: cultivation, crop production, crop protection and post-cropping practice (section 2.1).

5.	Among the agricultural practices examined, those associated with crop protection and the artificial inputs associated with crop production were seen as the most adverse for biodiversity.  Several practices were seen to benefit the biodiversity of arable land.  These included set-aside, crop rotations with grass leys, spring sowing, permanent pasture, green manuring and intercropping (section 2.7).

6.	Uncropped areas, such as sown grass strips (beetle banks), grass margins and conservation headlands, were seen as critical for the maintenance of biodiversity on arable farmland.  Changes in the balance of cropped to uncropped land within some farming regimes, linked to increase in field size, have had a major impact on the diversity of flora and fauna associated with those regimes (section 3.4).

7.	Based on the evaluation of agricultural practices used, the occurrence of uncropped land and the extent of the farming regime within England and Wales, it was concluded that Conventional Arable regimes act effectively to maintain the impoverished status of biodiversity on arable land.  Extreme examples can be found of intensively managed farms that further deplete biodiversity and sympathetically managed farms that try to enhance it.  Increased adoption of agricultural practices such as direct drilling, use of farmyard manure, set-aside, use of crop rotations with leys, or an increase in the incidence and sympathetic management of uncropped areas may well assist biodiversity on farms within this regime (sections 4.3 \& 4.4)

8.	Organic regimes were shown to have an overall benefit for biodiversity at the farm level, both in terms of the agricultural practices adopted and in the occurrence and management of uncropped areas (sections 4.3 \& 4.4).  

9.	Conventional Mixed Lowland and LEAF regimes were both seen to have the potential for enhancing biodiversity on arable land.  Here, adverse impacts associated with crop protection and crop production may be mitigated by beneficial effects associated with post-cropping practices, the occurrence of permanent pasture and uncropped land.  At present, the extent to which enhancement may be achieved, may well depend on the extent, condition and management of uncropped land present within these regimes (sections 4.3 \& 4.4).

10.	IFS-experimental regimes were seen to have a beneficial effect on biodiversity, due to the stringent procedures used for targeting herbicides and pesticides and for establishing and managing uncropped areas.  At present these regimes occupy a tiny area of the national resource of arable land and thus their impact on national biodiversity is likely to be insignificant at the present time (sections 4.3 \& 4.4).

11.	A number of areas are highlighted for further consideration.  These include:
?	monitoring of biodiversity on farms pre- and post- conversion to organic farming,
?	comparative studies that focus on the effectiveness of different regimes or agricultural practices in enhancing biodiversity on species-impoverished intensively managed arable land,
?	manipulative experiments to determine the optimal balance of cropped to uncropped areas for enhancing biodiversity,
?	manipulative experiments to examine the separate impacts of rotational regimes and agricultural inputs on biodiversity,
?	an economic assessment of the costs and benefits in both production and biodiversity terms, of conversion to organic, integrated production or uptake of available agri-environment schemes.}

Comprender la racionalidad ecol{\'o}gica en agricultores con caracter{\'i}sticas diferentes a la agricultura tradicional, podr{\'i}a contribuir a avanzar hacia una agricultura sustentable. Sin embargo, esto no es sencillo debido a la propia complejidad del t{\'e}rmino y la ausencia de una metodolog{\'i}a que permita abordarla. En este contexto, se propone y valida una metodolog{\'i}a para abordar la racionalidad ecol{\'o}gica en tres grupos de agricultores hort{\'i}colas del partido de La Plata, Argentina. La propuesta consta de ocho pasos: 1) definici{\'o}n del marco conceptual, 2) planteo de hip{\'o}tesis, 3) definici{\'o}n de las dimensiones de an{\'a}lisis, 4) definici{\'o}n de {\'a}mbitos, categor{\'i}as y descriptores de an{\'a}lisis, 5) definici{\'o}n de los indicadores, 6) relevamiento de datos, 7) an{\'a}lisis de resultados, 8) validaci{\'o}n de la hip{\'o}tesis.

We focused on dairy cattle, pigs, poultry layers and broilers as the most represented species. We found (i) a 14\% lower productivity for organic dairy cattle, (ii) an 11\% and 89\% lower feed use efficiency respectively for organic dairy cattle and poultry broilers, (iii) and a lower competition between feed and food use for organic cattle dairy. These results are key to accurately model global organic systems and to assess their potential contribution to global food security.},

The experiment was farmers? participatory with a group of 8 farmers. Two seeding rates were used; farmers? traditional seed rate of 26 kg ha-1 (D2) as high seed rate and lower seed rate of 13 kg ha-1 (D1). Observations were made on growth and yield parameters of the crop. The results showed that growth and yield of celosia were significantly (P{\ensuremath{<}}0.05) influenced by system of crop intensification. The results of seeding rates? effects on number of leaves, stem width and yield showed that low seed rate (D1) performed better than high seed rate (D2). Low seed rate (D1) resulted in higher marketable fresh leaf yield of 12.24 ton ha-1 compared to high seed rate (D2) of 8.82 ton ha-1. The accrued revenue / ha ranged between ?882,000 to ?1,224,000 [?150 = \$1 (US Dollar)] for D2 and D1 respectively, subsequently increasing farmers? income. Overall, this investigation revealed that both growth and yield of Celosia argentea can be improved with low seeding rate that is a component of system of crop intensification.}

Vor dem Hintergrund einer zunehmenden Vielzahl an Awards in der Praxis, die sich an Unternehmen richten, multiplen Krisen, die Unternehmen in unterschiedlicher Weise ?st{\"o}ren? sowie neuen EU-Regelungen, wie zur evidenzbasierten Unternehmenskommunikation {\"u}ber {\"o}kologische Aspekte, ist die Frage nach der Kraft von Awards neu zu beleuchten und Antworten wichtiger als zuvor. In einer Doppelstudie im Rahmen des Deutschen Bundesstiftung Umwelt (DBU) gef{\"o}rderten Projekts SIEGER, wurden dazu im Fr{\"u}hjahr 2023 deutschlandweiten Vergabeinstitutionen von Awards sowie Unternehmen online befragt. 
Ziel war es, herauszufinden, welche Effekte Nachhaltigkeitsawards (NHA) aus Sicht von Vergabeinstitutionen, den Award-Geber*innen, und von Unternehmen, den Award-Nehmer*innen, haben und welchen Beitrag sie zu einer Nachhaltigkeitstransformation leisten k{\"o}nnen. 
Nachhaltigkeitsawards werden meist positive bis sehr positive Effekte zugeschrieben, sowohl auf der Mikroebene (Mitarbeiter*innenmotivation), vor allem aber auf der Mesoebene (Imagegewinn; Wahrnehmung), weniger auf der Makroebene ({\"o}kologische Aspekte; soziale Aspekte). Die Bewertung der Kraft von Awards, deren Wirkungsrichtung und St{\"a}rke, in dieser Studie ist perzipiert und wird durch das unterschiedliche Framing der Befragten gepr{\"a}gt. Award-Geber*innen und Preistr{\"a}ger*innen {\"u}bersch{\"a}tzen die Wahrnehmung von Awards von Dritten sowie die externen Lerneffekte (Nachahmeffekte). Der Themenfokus Nachhaltigkeit l{\"a}sst Vergabeinstitutionen von Nachhaltigkeitsawards die anvisierten {\"o}kologische Effekte einer Awardvergabe {\"u}berzeichnen. 
Aus Sicht der meisten Befragten k{\"o}nnen Awards zur Nachhaltigkeitstransformation beitragen. NHA wird im Vergleich zu anderen Awards dabei mehr Kraft und ein positiverer Beitrag zur Nachhaltigkeitstransformation zugeschrieben. Die Analyse verdeutlicht zudem, Awards sind ein Spiegel der aktuellen politischen und gesellschaftlichen Forderungen und Entwicklungen. Jenseits eines {\"o}kologischen Claims ?Nachhaltigkeitsaward? integrieren Awards sozial-{\"o}kologische Aspekte in ihren Anforderungen an die unternehmerischen Teilnehmenden des Wettbewerbs. Die Weiterentwicklung von Nachhaltigkeitsawards kann demnach durch eine interne Entwicklung auf Seiten der Vergabeinstitutionen erfolgen und durch externe Ma{\ss}nahmen unterst{\"u}tzt werden.},

However, there remains a challenge of poor quality and yield of vegetables. This study aimed to enhance the quality and yield of kale ((Brassica oleracea var. acephala) in Kabete - Kenya, through use of organic inputs and integration of chickpea (Cicer arietinum) either as an intercrop or in rotation with kale. The experimental layout was a randomized complete block design with a split plot arrangement. The main plots were cropping systems; crop rotation (Chickpea ? Kale), monocropping (sole Kale) and intercropping (chickpea/Kale). The split plots were organic inputs (FYM and Minjingu rock phosphate).  The preferred kale quality attributes were also assessed during the study through a survey targeting 70 farmers. To ascertain the sustainability of the imposed treatments, partial and full nutrient balances (N, P and K) were determined using NUTMON.   Parameters collected for the survey included the major vegetable produced by the farmers and the quality attributes they aim for in production, challenges that they face and coping strategies adopted. Organic carbon, N, P, K and kale yield were measured for the on station experiments. About 78\% of farmers produced kale with the major quality attributes preferred being large size (76\%) and produce free from disease and pest signs (52\%) such as black rot and diamond back moth. The production challenges were; unpredictable rains (85\%), lack of standardized input application rates (66\%) and lack of irrigation equipment (43\%). Organic C (3.2\%), N (0.45\%) and K (1.5 mg/kg) were significantly (P{\ensuremath{<}}0.05) higher in the rotation system with application of FYM. P content was significantly (P{\ensuremath{<}}0.05) higher in the intercropping systems with application of Rock P (32 mg/kg). The kale yields followed a similar trend as for the nutrients C, N and K with highest yield (1.62 t/ha) obtained in the rotation system with application of FYM. The control (0.45 t/ha) of the intercrop had the lowest Kale yield. Positive full N balances were realized in the crop rotation systems with application of FYM whereas the partial N balances were all negative across cropping systems and organic inputs except for the monocropping system with application of FYM.  Positive full and partial P balances were realized in all the cropping systems with the application of Rock P.  Negative full P balances were realized in all cropping systems with application of FYM and control. Negative full and partial K balances were realized across cropping systems and organic inputs. Kales grown in rotation with chick pea and application of FYM are a sustainable strategy for enhanced kale production in Kabete.

        abstract = {A referencing system to collect and analyse performances of French organic rabbit farms was created using an Excel sheet. Performances of reproduction were compilated on 6 farms over 3 years of production (2015-2017). Does are housed in movable cage on pasture or in individual paddock, the livestock size averages 33 does. The productive time of a doe averaged 374 d. and was variable (75\%). Female mortality averaged 17\% over the period, while culling reached 10\%. With 4.8 matings, 2.7 parturitions per female/year were obtained (60\% fertility rate), for a total of 21.6 rabbits born alive and 16.7 weaned (26\% mortality from birth to weaning). The yearly turnover of a full-time rabbit farmer (80 females) would potentially be around 26.3k?/year. The database is actually extending to a larger number of farms, thanks to the deployment of a smartphone application (GAELA), that enable a management assistance of the rabbit farm and data collection, synchronized to a national securised database.}

        abstract = {Field trials on weed control in direct seeding with the use of natural phytotoxic ingredients (NPI) were carried out from 2011 to 2013 at the Agricultural Research Institute of Paran{\'a} state, Brazil (IAPAR). 
Soybean was direct seeded into residues of precrop black oats ({$\backslash$}textit\{Avena strigosa)\}. In a split-plot trial the whole-plot treatment consisted of two different weed densities. In the eight subplot treatments the effects of "natural phytotoxic ingredients" (NPI) on weed control was evaluated.
The two NPI formulations used in the experiment contained 50 L/ha Pine Oil (formulation ``Pine Oil'') or 50 L/ha d-Limonene (formulation ``Limonene''), both combined with 50 kg/ha NaCl. These formulations were applied once, twice, or three times in a weekly interval. A weedy and a manually hoed clean plot was used as control treatment.
The single application treatments of Limonene and Pine Oil scored 41 {$\backslash$}\% and 52 {$\backslash$}\%, two applications 53 {$\backslash$}\% and 56 {$\backslash$}\% and three applications 61 {$\backslash$}\% and 67 {$\backslash$}\% respectively, with a 70 {$\backslash$}\% rating being considered an acceptable result in conventional herbicide testing. 
The grain yield for the 'clean' control treatment was highest with 4.07 t/ha and lowest for the untreated control treatment with 2.61 t/ha. The limonene treatments yielded 3.07, 3.22, 3.57, and the pine oil treatments 2.68, 3.00 and 2.96 t/ha with one, two and three applications respectively. The lower grain yields of pine oil despite slightly better performance in the weed control rating can be explained by phytotoxic effects of applied product which came in contact with soybean crop during application. }

O SAF com bracatinga nas condi{\c c}{\~o}es estudadas pode ser caracterizado como sustent{\'a}vel em m{\'e}dio prazo, mas fazem-se necess{\'a}rios ajustes no seu atual modelo produtivo para que possa adquirir sustentabilidade em longo prazo.},

Due to limited knowledge of broiler welfare and management on organic farms in Sweden, the study aim was to gather information regarding health, housing and management routines, in order to describe the current situation on these. Farm visits performed in 2018 included 8 out of 12 established organic farms, on which either Rowan Ranger or HubbardJA57/HubbardJA87 were reared. Chickens in the observed flocks were 55 {$\pm$} 6 (44?62) days of age. Observations included farmer interviews, indoor environment assessments, clinical examinations and gait scoring. Clinical examinations revealed no severe remarks, however minor to moderate plumage dirtiness, food pad dermatitis and hock burns were found in 47\%, 21\% and 13\% of the birds, respectively. Although no severe walking impairments were observed, minor to moderate gait abnormalities were seen in two-thirds of the birds. Gait in birds assessed outdoors was significantly better than in birds observed indoors. Body weight uniformity was low in all flocks. This study provides increased knowledge of certain chicken health and welfare aspects, housing and management on Swedish organic farms. Future research should further investigate important aspects related to bird welfare, such as the high mortality rates observed.},

The aim of this project was to examine how rotations incorporating organic poultry use the cycling of nutrients between soil, crops and birds. Poultry studies have measured nutrient values of manure in slow growing meat birds at about day 81 when fed typical broiler rations versus ?Label Rouge? rations. Nutrient (N, P, K) balances were constructed to assess the viability of integrating poultry production within a theoretical organic rotation. The readilyplant- available nitrogen in manure from Ross 308 birds fed either presumed non-limiting rations or Label Rouge rations was within the range reported for intensive broilers. For ISA 657 birds, the manure readily-plant-available nitrogen was similar to the mean value reported for broilers, when fed presumed non limiting rations, but towards the lower range when fed Label Rouge rations. As breed growth and feed intakes differ it is suggested that to optimise the utilisation of nutrients, the nutrient content of table bird manures should be checked prior to land application. The nutrient budgets were similar for N and P regardless of the length of rotation or form of poultry production. On average, there was a surplus of 85 kg/ha N over all the scenarios. There tended to be a deficit of K in all scenarios (average: 10 kg/ha).},

Diese bestehenden Forschungsl{\"u}cken wurden mit dem hier vorgestellten Projekt geschlossen, welches drei Schwerpunktstudien umfasst.
1) Mit der ersten Studie wird eine umfassende Struktur- und Situationsanalyse zum {\"o}kologischen Gartenbau in Deutschland aus sozio{\"o}konomischer Sicht vorgelegt.
Dazu wurde eine Expertenbefragung mit 22 Vertreter des {\"o}kologischen Gartenbaus und der ihm vor- und nachgelagerten Bereichen durchgef{\"u}hrt, sowie in einer bundesweiten Betriebsbefragung insgesamt 204 {\"o}kologische Produktionsbetriebe besucht und befragt. Dabei wurden verschiedenste unternehmensinterne und ?externe Daten gewonnen und die Einstellungen und Erwartungen der Unternehmer und ihrer Familien im Hinblick auf vorhandene Entwicklungspotentiale und Umstellungshindernisse erfragt.
2) Es wurden zwei Modelle typischer Betriebe f{\"u}r den {\"o}kologischen Gem{\"u}sebau entwickelt. Mittels dieser Modelle lassen sich zum einen Angaben {\"u}ber den Status Quo der Wettbewerbsf{\"a}higkeit der {\"o}kologischen Produktion machen, zum anderen dienen die Modelle der Simulation von m{\"o}glichen Politikfolgen und potentiellen Auswirkungen von Marktentwicklungen.
3) Basierend auf einer Befragung von 200 Betriebsleitern {\"o}kologisch und konventionell wirtschaftender Betriebe wurde untersucht, welchen Einfluss das Informationsverhalten auf die Umstellungsentscheidung und den Umstellungsverlauf haben. Diese Schwerpunktstudie orientiert sich an adoptionstheoretischen {\"U}berlegungen und vorangegangenen Untersuchungen zum Innovationsverhalten von Entscheidungstr{\"a}gern im Bereich Gartenbau und Landwirtschaft.},

The aim of this article is to assess technical similarity of conventional farmers concerned by a water catchment to organic farming. We build a typology of farmers based on technical logics related to cropping systems organization. We differentiated five types of farmers among 18 conventional dairy farmers and three recently converted organic farmers. According to our results, only two farmers can be considered as close to technical logics identified in organic farms. Nevertheless, we could identify partial technical similarities for two other farmer groups. These similarities may be useful for catchment managers to initiate transitions towards organic farming.},

        abstract = {Die Verbraucherpreise spiegeln die wahren Kosten der Milch nicht wieder. Niedrige Erzeugerpreise setzen Landwirte und K{\"u}he unter Druck. Die Milchkuh wird k{\"o}rperlich durch hohe Leistungen belastet und von ihrem nat{\"u}rlichen Lebensraum dem Gr{\"u}nland entfremdet. Eine hochtechnisierte Landwirtschaft, die von fossiler Energie abh{\"a}ngig ist, hat sich etabliert. Die externen Kosten und Leistungen im Hinblick auf Tierwohl, Klima, Gesundheit und Umwelt sind selten im Preis enthalten.
In der Arbeit wurde als Alternative eine wesensgem{\"a}{\ss}e Milchviehhaltung, die das biodiverse {\"O}kosystem extensives Gr{\"u}nland pflegt, mit kuhgebundener K{\"a}lberaufzucht und Gras- bzw. Heuf{\"u}tterung behandelt. Die externen Kosten von Treibhausgasen, reaktivem Stickstoff, Energieverbrauch und Luftschadstoffen wurden f{\"u}r den Beispielbetrieb und die einzelnen Betriebszweige (Landwirtschaft, K{\"a}serei und Vermarktung) berechnet. Dies erfolgte sowohl f{\"u}r die direkte Energie als auch n{\"a}herungsweise f{\"u}r die indirekte Energie der Maschinen und Betriebsstoffe. Effekte durch die Landnutzung von Niedermoorb{\"o}den und eine differenzierte Betrachtung von biogenem Methan als Kreislaufgas wurden f{\"u}r eine ganzheitliche Bewertung ebenfalls einbezogen und mit aktueller Literatur verglichen.
Als Basis der Berechnung dienten die Buchf{\"u}hrungsergebnisse des Beispielbetriebs aus dem WJ 2019/20. Sie wurden um drei m{\"o}gliche Lohnans{\"a}tze f{\"u}r die nicht entlohnten Arbeitskr{\"a}fte erweitert. Eine Monetarisierung der Treibhausgase wurde in vier Preisszenarien dargestellt, um m{\"o}gliche zuk{\"u}nftige Entwicklungen darzustellen. {\"U}ber Verteilungsschl{\"u}ssel wurden die Kosten dem Milchvieh zugeordnet. Betrieblich wurden die Beihilfen und Zusch{\"u}sse wie Direktzahlungen und Biopr{\"a}mie abgezogen, um den Mindestpreis f{\"u}r Konsummilch zu ermitteln. Diese haben jedoch keinen Einfluss auf die wahren Kosten.
Als Ergebnis erhielt man die wahren Erzeuger- und Verbraucherpreise, die weit {\"u}ber dem Durchschnitt von Biomilch liegen. Die Direktvermarktung hat sich als einzige M{\"o}glichkeit zur nachhaltigen Betriebskostendeckung gezeigt. Die ermittelten Kosten- und Leistungen stellen eine Momentaufnahme dar. Da es sich um einen jungen Betrieb handelt, der in den letzten Jahren noch im Wachstum und Bestandsaufbau war, muss von ver{\"a}nderlichen Daten in kommenden Jahren ausgegangen werden.},

Most study farmers were motivated to convert for financial, not ideological or life-style reasons; organic meat production was the most common planned enterprise. At the time of study, organic beef and sheep meat production was particularly profitable. It was found that, in these product sectors, a large improvement in Family Farm Income would result if organic production was introduced on the case study farms. With few exceptions, a fall in Family Farm Income during the conversion period would not be an obstacle to farmers changing to organic methods. Fixed cost changes would also not deter conversion but expensive investment in new livestock and appropriate buldings would be required by some of those businesses studied. These findings are, however, dependent upon the price premia assumptions used.},

For the further development of reduced tillage systems in organic farming a long-term experiment was established 2010 on a Loess soil in Aesch BL, Switzerland. The factors are tillage (plough vs. reduced) and fertilization (slurry vs. mineral fertilization on two levels each (1=low; 2=high) and no fertilization). The mean yield over 13 years was reduced by 4\% with RT compared to ploughing (PL). Organic carbon stocks increased significantly in the surface layer (0?10 cm) in RT compared to PL, while in the 10?20 cm layer, they were not significantly lower (P{$\leq$}0.01). Life Cycle Assessment (or simply LCA) revealed an 18 to 32\% lower impact of RT on climate change, mainly due to more carbon being sequestered in the soil but also less energy use. Gross margins for RT vary depending on fertilizer treatment: with unfertilised and slurry1 they were similar to PL, with slurry2 they were 9\% lower than with PL. Lower gross margins for RT were due to yield reductions and thus lower revenues. However, when subsidies for RT were considered, all RT treatments had a higher gross margin than the corresponding treatments with ploughing.}

These are not determined a priori, but are defined through a statistical class splitting model. For the estimation of treatment effects, an endogenous treatment model is consequently used. Results suggest that organic certification makes economic sense for dairy farmers in Europe. On the basis of this model, certification effects across classes range between 38\% and more than 140\% in terms of profitability gains, and 0\% and 5\% in terms of efficiency gains.}

The overarching aim of the project is to improve young stock rearing systems concerning animal welfare-friendly husbandry, feeding and disease prevention by identifying approaches on different levels. More natural rearing systems are one approach to solve welfare problems in current calf rearing. Previous studies have shown considerable variations in herd characteristics and management strategies between organic dairy farms in Europe. The differences have been associated with regional and national conditions for organic farming. However, it is possible that differences in national legislation also play a part in these variations. Relevant EU and national rules on organic production and animal welfare were compiled in the following seven European countries: Sweden (SE), France (FR), Poland (PL), Germany (DE), Italy (IT), Austria (AT), and Switzerland (CH). The purpose was to provide information on drivers and barriers for cow-calf contact systems in organic dairy production and to identify possible areas for improvement and/or harmonization. Our results did not identify any major barriers in national rules for the use of rearing systems allowing cow-calf contact. Instead, cow-calf contact is promoted by the requirement to feed organic calves preferably maternal milk during the first three months of their life. Specifications regarding calf rearing derives from animal protection legislation rather than regulations of organic farming but milk hygiene regulations can also have an influence on practicability of cow-calf contact. Variations in national legislation can affect details of design and implementation of cow-calf systems, however, other factors (e.g. overall conditions for organic dairy farming, traditions, economics and disease prevention strategies) rather than regulations likely play more important roles.}

Environmental and economic indicators are calculated at crop rotation scale to complete the previous yield assessment. In 2012, a research program enabled the model adaptation to organic systems, taking into account weed management and organic inputs supply. This program also allowed to parameterize the web software in the Ile-de-France region for 8 soil types and 18crops. Parameterization has been validated for the most common situations. Validation remains to be done for less common ones. When completed, validation will make it possible to test the software in promising situations of use, such as supporting organic farmers analyzing their current cropping systems, or supporting farmers thinking about converting their farms to organic farming.},

        abstract = {In Nordrhein-Westfalen (NRW), dem mit 18 Mill. Einwohnern bev{\"o}lkerungsreichsten Bundesland Deutschlands, wurden am 1.1.2002 2,6\% der landwirtschaftlichen Fl{\"a}che {\"o}kologisch bewirtschaftet. Dabei wiesen die anhand von Daten des Landesamts f{\"u}r Statistik NRW, der Landwirtschaftskammern und der Anbauverb{\"a}nde {\"O}kologischer Landbau untersuchten 34 Landkreise in NRW eine Spannweite von 0,1\% bis 7,5\% Anteil {\"o}kologisch bewirtschafteter Fl{\"a}che auf. Ziel dieses Beitrages ist die Analyse der Agrarstruktur als Erkl{\"a}rungsansatz f{\"u}r die regionalr{\"a}umlich unterschiedliche Dichte an {\"o}kologisch wirtschaftenden Betrieben in NRW.
In NRW ist in Regionen mit hohem Spezialisierungsgrad und dabei hoher Umweltbelastung, unter den derzeitigen agrarpolitischen Rahmenbedingungen die Ausweitung des {\"O}kologischen Landbaus sehr begrenzt. {\"O}kologisch wirtschaftende Betriebe k{\"o}nnen systembedingt nicht gleicherma{\ss}en simplifiziert organisiert werden, und f{\"u}r einzelne Produkte ist der Markt im {\"O}kologischen Landbau sehr klein (u.a. Schweinefleisch, Zuckerr{\"u}ben). In Landkreisen mit einem hohen Anteil an Veredlungs- oder Marktfruchtbetrieben (25 - 31\% bzw. 56 - 78\% der Betriebe) ist der {\"O}kologische Landbau bislang kaum vertreten (unter 0,7\% der Fl{\"a}che bzw. Betriebe). Dies sind Landkreise mit zumeist hohen Pachtpreisen (bis 400 EUR/ha AF), teilweise hohen Standardbetriebseinkommen (bis 65.600 EUR/Betrieb bzw. 2.300 EUR/ha) und hohen Grundst{\"u}ckswerten (40.000 EUR/ha) bei spezialisiertem intensiven Ackerbau mit hohem Zuckerr{\"u}ben- (bis 28\%), Kartoffel- (bis 16\%) und Feldgem{\"u}seanteil (bis 11\%) oder hohen Viehdichten (bis 2,4 GV/ha), v.a. an Schweinen (bis 940 Schweine je 100 ha). Der Anteil {\"o}kologisch wirtschaftender Betriebe nimmt in den Landkreisen mit zunehmendem Anteil an konventionellen Veredlungs- oder Marktfruchtbetrieben ab (r =  0,56*** bzw.  0,39*), w{\"a}hrend die Beziehung zum Anteil Futterbaubetriebe positiv ist (r = 0,45*). 
Die Betriebe des {\"O}kologischen Landbaus liegen demgegen{\"u}ber konzentriert in den Landkreisen der Mittelgebirge im S{\"u}den und S{\"u}dosten NRWs (5 - 7\% Fl{\"a}chenanteil). Dabei handelt es sich um Landkreise mit {\"u}berwiegend geringer Standortgunst, hohem Gr{\"u}nlandanteil (bis 95\%), geringem Anteil hochwertiger Marktfr{\"u}chte und einem mittleren Viehbesatz (1,0 bis 1,5 GV/ha). Bereits extensiv wirtschaftende Futterbaubetriebe mit hohem Gr{\"u}nlandanteil und {\"u}berwiegend Rinderhaltung stellen derzeit bevorzugt um. Der Gr{\"u}nlandanteil der {\"o}kologisch wirtschaftenden Betriebe in NRW betr{\"a}gt 59\% gegen{\"u}ber 28\% bei konventioneller Bewirtschaftung. In den 34 Landkreisen ist die Beziehung zwischen dem Anteil Gr{\"u}nland an der LF und dem Anteil {\"o}kologisch wirtschaftender Betriebe eng (r = 0.66***). In NRW ist im Mittel der {\"o}kologisch wirtschaftenden Betriebe der Anteil Mutterk{\"u}he am Viehbestand deutlich h{\"o}her (22,2\% statt 3,8\%) im Vergleich zu den konventionellen Betrieben, w{\"a}hrend die Schweinehaltung nur einen Anteil von 5,6\% gegen{\"u}ber 36,0\% einnimmt. Die Beziehung zwischen der Dichte an Schweinen und dem Anteil {\"o}kologisch wirtschaftender Betriebe in den Landkreisen ist negativ (r =  0,57***).

        abstract = {As the process of industrialization has run its course over the twentieth century, the relative importance of agriculture as an economic activity and a means of cultural sustenance for nations has declined dramatically. In this thesis, a historical ecological-economic perspective offers insights into both the causes and effects of Danish agriculture's decline in economic importance relative to the economy of Denmark as a whole. Emergy evaluations were made of the national economy and agricultural subsystem of Denmark for the years 1936, 1970 and 1999. Emergy is defined as all the available energy that was used in the work of making a product and expressed in units of one type of energy (Odum, 1996). In total, six separate emergy analyses were performed. By quantifying the emergy requirements of both a national agricultural system and the economy within which this system is nested, the analysis highlights the changing relationship of these two systems over a temporal scale of 63 years.

The ecological sustainability of the studied systems is assessed through the calculation of emergy-based indices and ratios. In accordance with emergy theory, ecological sustainability is considered to be a function of the dependence of a system on renewable emergy, the degree to which the system depends on imported emergy, and the overall load that the system places on the environment. The analysis indicates that as the national economy of Denmark evolved to rely more on the use of non-renewable emergy and on emergy appropriated through trade to stimulate economic activity and to generate wealth, its sustainability declined, and the importance of the Danish agricultural system to the national economy subsided. While the total amount of emergy supporting the economy of Denmark over the period studied increased substantially, the total emergy supporting agriculture remained relatively constant. Furthermore, though the emergy signature and thermodynamic efficiencies of Danish agricultural production changed significantly, the total emergy required for production fluctuated little. This implies that the thermodynamically optimal level of emergy investment to agricultural production from society may fall within a range that is essentially fixed. Finally, the analysis draws attention to the fact that because agricultural systems are coupled to renewable emergy flows that are limited in the amount of work processes that they can power, agricultural systems register small net emergy yields, thus, agriculture is not likely to be a primary motive force in an economy with access to storages of fossil and other fuels that provide large net emergy yields.}

        abstract = {This is the final report from the Defra project OF0103
In the UK fewer than 50 dairy farms were registered as organic in June 1995. The slow increase of farmers willing to convert to organic milk production was seen as one impediment for development of the organic milk market. The overall objective of this joint 3-year project was to monitor the physical, environmental and financial implications of conversion to organic milk production on a research farm (Ty Gwyn) and ten commercial farms in southwest England and Wales, in order to provide policy makers and farmers with more information about the consequences of conversion. Although the size of the sample is comparably small it represents about 20\% of all organic dairy farms in the UK and an even larger proportion of farms converting in the South Western region at the time. 
The report has substantial section on the following themes:
?	Land use and farm management, including the varying degrees of enterprise specialisation, conversion in stages or all at once, and motives for conversion
?	Soil nutrients, including nutrient budgets and balances, in which organic management generally produced lower nutrient surpluses
?	Herbage production trends after conversion and related to other factors such as soil type; generally herbage production fell sharply initially but then recovered substantially in the second and third years, also with increased herbage quality
?	Biodiversity studies, showing that there were few weed problems and that species richness of small mammals and birds tended to increase after conversion
?	Animal production, showing increasing milk from forage per cow and initial sharp falls in stocking rate, which then increased to within 90\% of the period before conversion by year 4 of organic management.
?	Animal health, where the main features were reduced use of antibiotics, increased use of alternative remedies, only slightly higher rates of clinical mastitis, and only low incidence of bloat even with clover rich grazing
?	Economic performance, where initial milk sales were substantially reduced as premiums could not be obtained in the first three years when stocking rates were so much reduced, although gross margins per cow were increased due to reduced variable costs; this was followed by a recovery of revenue levels, to an extent which varied with farm type, but the small sample size requires caution in interpreting the results.

environment in Denmark challenges the agricultural sector as a whole and the individual
farms in particular. Public pressure to strengthen the regulation of the farmers? use of inputs threatens to raise costs and bind the individual farmer by detailed rules for crop rotation, fertiliser strategy etc. At the same time, there is evidence that this type of general regulation is not sufficient to reduce the environmental impact compared with overall goals (for instance, the goal of reducing nitrate leaching and pesticide use by 50\% before 1997 has failed). This has lead to increased pressure to use economic regulation (nitrogen taxes etc.) which the farmers? unions have been able to avoid so far (except for a very small pesticide tax). Also, authorities increasingly try to protect groundwater in zones of special interest as drinking water reservoirs by severely limiting agricultural production or even by expropriating farmland for reforestation projects. Moreover, new issues concerning for instance, landscape aesthetics and biodiversity are even more complicated to regulate using only nation-wide
legislation and economic incentives. For these reasons, both farmers and authorities have interests in finding ways to stimulate the inclusion of environmental aspects in the local development of agricultural systems in different parts of the country.

Based on this background, this paper will

conventional and organic livestock farms concerning the development of an ethical
accounting system. The approach will be described and the farmers? reactions discussed.

And many Danish livestock farmers have improved the utilization of manure during the last five to ten years. There is, however, still not consensus concerning the question of whether the results are sufficient to reduce the loss of nitrogen to ground water and the Danish marine environment to acceptable levels.
In an analysis of 30 dairy farms Halberg et al. (1995) showed a variation in N surplus between 88 and 387 kg/ha depending on stocking rate and management. At ca. 1.4 livestock units1) per ha there was a difference between 250 and 116kg N/ha farm level surplus. It was concluded that differences between farms with comparable stocking rates were more dependent on differences in crop rotation and fertilization strategy than on animal feeding levels and production. There is, however, a need for a better understanding of the relations between different feeding and crop cultivation strategies both from a management and a regulations point of view.
We therefore find it interesting to study the possibilities for reducing dairy farm N-loss and how they can be exploited in commercial farming. We take the perspective of the farm and will show the need to understand the interdependencies in the production system and between the production system and -the different functions of- the management system. For this purpose we suggest a method called systemic modelling (S{\o}rensen \& Kristensen, 1992) where empirical findings from farms studies and experimental knowledge together form the basis for the development of computer models. This paper will

- present modelled results concerning the possibilities for a reduction in dairy farm N  loss and on the basis of this and earlier empirical findings,

- discuss some important aspects of farm nitrogen balances (stocking rate, feeding strategy, fertilization strategy, management style),

- demonstrate the need for an integrated model that can handle interdependencies between crop and livestock production, and

- discuss the importance of these recognitions when considering regulation of farm N losses.

An alternative method based on studies in private farms is proposed to evaluate the effects of the production intensity on pollution and resource efficiency. Energy use and crop yield in gram and grass-clover crops registered on conventional and organic mixed dairy farms were analyzed in order to facilitate modelization of energy efficiency in different production systems on different danish soil types. The energy efficiency was higher in organic crops on all soil types with the smallest difference on irrigated sandy soils. Yields were highest in conventional crops receiving large indirect inputs of energy from fertilizers. The yield response was not sufficient to give the same energy efficiency as in organic crops. Combined with an earlier analysis of nitrogen surplus and efficiency on the same farms the results indicate that high efficiency in use of both nitrogen and energy can be achieved by reducing intensity of production in mixed dairy farming. The need to include the farmers value orientation in the farming systems analysis is discussed.},

There is a need for an overview of indicators used and a review of results and experiences reported. Ten IOA systems covering the topics of the farm's use of nutrients, pesticides and energy were selected from a survey of 55 systems and compared in this paper. The approaches and indicators used vary from systems based on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) to accounts based systems that use physical input-output units. Many IOA systems use farm gate nutrient balances, pesticide use per ha and energy use per kg product. These indicators are easy to calculate but the resulting value needs separate interpretation for the farmer. Other systems include modelled emissions and rate the yearly farm results using closed scales, which allows for easy interpretation but builds on implicit normative assumptions of best practices. Participating farmers were most often reported to be motivated for the use of IOA but empirical evidence of improved environmental farm performance was scarce. IOA systems should be linked with production planning tools used by the advisory services. Farmers and advisors needs better reference values to evaluate the indicator levels (environmental performance) on the individual farm possibly based on analysis of a larger number of farms. The statistical properties of IOA indicators need to be researched regarding: (1) The relation between changed management practice and changes in indicator values on a given farm over a period of time. (2) The relative importance of systematic vs. coincidental differences in environmental performance of a set of farms. It is concluded that IOA systems could become effective tools for agri-environmental improvement of European farms given further development and standardisation.},

Utgangspunktet for arbeidet er en helhetlig tiln{\ae}rming, der alle dimensjoner av b{\ae}rekraft inkluderes ved bruk av SAFA-rammeverket. Gjennom en prosess med bred medvirkning har vi sett p{\r a} status for norsk ammeku-produksjon i dag. Deretter har vi gjennomf{\o}rt ti SMART b{\ae}rekraftsanalyser p{\r a} g{\r a}rder med ammeku-produksjon, og diskutert resultatene av disse i to workshoper. I andre workshop gikk vi dypere inn i hvert tema i SAFA/SMART og diskuterte beste-praksis for ammeku-produksjon. I rapporten diskuterer vi SMART som mulig verkt{\o}y for vurdering og dokumentasjon av alle dimensjoner av b{\ae}rekraft. Konklusjonene er at alle temaene i SMART/SAFA er relevante for norske forhold, at SMART er godt egnet til {\r a} skape bevissthet om b{\ae}rekraft p{\r a} egen g{\r a}rd, men at SMART med fordel bedre kan tilpasses norsk begrepsbruk og knyttes til eksisterende verkt{\o}y. Selv om resultatene fra SMART-analysene fra de ti g{\r a}rdene er gode, er det et for lite utvalg til {\r a} konkludere p{\r a} b{\ae}rekraft i en hel produksjonsform. I tillegg er b{\ae}rekraft en prosess, og en b{\o}r v{\ae}re varsom med {\r a} konkludere med et niv{\r a} p{\r a} hvor b{\ae}rekraftig produksjonen er. Hovedkonklusjonen er at alltid {\r a} ha med helheten, er avgj{\o}rende for {\r a} kunne ta reelt b{\ae}rekraftige beslutninger},

        abstract = {Denne rapporten oppsummerer resultat av en studie av 20 melkebruk i M{\o}re og Romsdal fylke, ti fra hver av driftsformene {\o}kologisk og konvensjonelt. M{\r a}let med studien var {\r a} analysere og evaluere milj{\o}messig og {\o}konomisk b{\ae}rekraft p{\r a} disse g{\r a}rdene. Vi unders{\o}kte effekt av driftsform og intensitet uttrykt som mengde innkj{\o}pt nitrogen per daa g{\r a}rdsareal. Vi fant at overskuddet av nitrogen, fosfor og kalium, energiforbruket og klimagassutslippet per daa var h{\o}yere ved konvensjonell enn {\o}kologisk produksjon og steg ved {\o}kende intensitet. Det var imidlertid stor variasjon mellom g{\r a}rdene innafor hver driftsform og m{\r a}lt per enhet melk og kj{\o}tt var forskjellen mellom driftsformene mindre. Resultatene kan i neste omgang brukes til {\r a} foresl{\r a} strategier for {\r a} forbedre milj{\o}messig og {\o}konomisk b{\ae}rekraft p{\r a} g{\r a}rdsniv{\r a} for begge driftsformer.
Milj{\o}indikatorer ble brukt til {\r a} beskrive effekt av produksjonsform og intensitetsniv{\r a}. Intensitetsniv{\r a} ble estimert som mengde kj{\o}pt nitrogen per daa g{\r a}rdsareal og {\r a}r. Milj{\o}indikatorene ble beregnet per daa g{\r a}rdsareal, per kg levert energikorrigert melk (EKM), per kg netto tilvekst for storfe p{\r a} g{\r a}rden, per MJ ford{\o}yelig energi og kg ford{\o}yelig protein i levert melk og kj{\o}tt-tilvekst. De viktigste indikatorene var: nitrogenoverskudd per daa og per kg nitrogen i produkt; fosfor- og kaliumoverskudd per daa; energiintensitet definert som energiforbruk per enhet spiselig energi i melk og kj{\o}tt tilvekst. Energiforbruk er summen av direkte energi og energi brukt til {\r a} lage materialer til bygninger, maskiner og andre innsatsfaktorer; klimagassutslipp definert som globalt oppvarmingspotensial i kg CO2-ekvivalenter; l{\o}nnsevne per storfeenhet og per arbeidstime.
Produksjonsniv{\r a}. G{\r a}rdene som ble drevet konvensjonelt i prosjektet produserte mer kj{\o}tt og melk per arealenhet enn de som drev {\o}kologisk, men det var stor variasjon innafor begge grupper. Det ble brukt mer kraftf{\^o}r p{\r a} g{\r a}rdene som drev konvensjonelt, men mengden varierte mye innafor begge grupper. Melkeytelsen var stort sett h{\o}y, men ogs{\r a} her var det stor variasjon. De g{\r a}rdene som hadde lavest melkeytelse drev {\o}kologisk. H{\o}y melkeytelse og mye innkj{\o}pt f{\^o}r gav grunnlag for h{\o}y produksjon per arealenhet. 
Nitrogen. G{\r a}rdene som drev {\o}kologisk, hadde h{\o}yere nitrogeneffektivitet enn de som drev konvensjonelt. G{\r a}rder med {\o}kologisk drift hadde derfor lavere risiko for utslipp av nitrogen til luft og vann. Beregnet for hele driftssystemet hadde g{\r a}rdene som drev konvensjonelt dobbelt s{\r a} stort N-overskudd som de som drev {\o}kologisk. Forskjellene mellom driftsm{\r a}tene var enda st{\o}rre for det fulldyrka arealet p{\r a} egen g{\r a}rd. Gjennomsnittlig overskudd var 22 kg nitrogen per dekar og {\r a}r p{\r a} g{\r a}rder som drev konvensjonelt og 9 kg nitrogen p{\r a} g{\r a}rder som drev {\o}kologisk. Regnet per enhet produkt i form av melk og kj{\o}tt var nitrogenoverskuddet 50 \% st{\o}rre p{\r a} driftssystemniv{\r a} p{\r a} de g{\r a}rdene som drev konvensjonelt, sammenlignet med de som drev {\o}kologisk. Mengde innkj{\o}pt nitrogengj{\o}dsel var den faktoren som f{\o}rte til st{\o}rst forskjell i nitrogen-effektivitet mellom de to driftsformene. Variasjonen i nitrogeneffektivitet innafor hver av de to driftsformene skyldtes i stor grad andre sider ved g{\r a}rdsdrifta.  
Fosfor og kalium. Alle g{\r a}rdene hadde overskudd av fosfor og kalium, men det var stor variasjon mellom g{\r a}rdene i overskudd av b{\r a}de fosfor og kalium. P{\r a} noen g{\r a}rder var overskuddet sv{\ae}rt lite. Det var en tendens til {\o}kende overskudd av b{\r a}de fosfor og kalium med {\o}kende innkj{\o}p av nitrogen og tendens til h{\o}yere overskudd p{\r a} g{\r a}rder som drev konvensjonelt enn g{\r a}rder som drev {\o}kologisk. 
Energi. Energiintensiteten var h{\o}yere ved konvensjonell driftsform enn ved {\o}kologisk. Det skyldes i hovedsak st{\o}rre energiforbruk for {\r a} produsere kunstgj{\o}dsel. Det er viktig {\r a} inkludere maskiner og bygninger i energiregnskapet da energi brukt til {\r a} produsere materialer til maskiner og bygninger varierte fra 15 til 44 \% av all energibruk p{\r a} g{\r a}rdene. 
Klimagassutslipp. Klimagassutslippene, registrert som CO2-ekvivalenter beregnet som GWP100 (IPCC 2006), steg per daa ved {\o}kende intensitetsniv{\r a} uttrykt som mengde innkj{\o}pt nitrogen per daa og var signifikant lavere ved {\o}kologisk enn ved konvensjonell drift. N{\r a}r utslippene ble regnet per produsert mengde melk og kj{\o}tt eller per enhet energi eller protein minsket forskjellen mellom driftsformene, men den var fortsatt signifikant. Utslipp fra produksjon og bruk av innkj{\o}pt gj{\o}dsel, er hoved{\r a}rsaken til h{\o}yere klimagassutslipp ved konvensjonell enn ved {\o}kologisk melkeproduksjon. Estimert oppvarmingseffekt av beregnede klimagassutslipp fra melkeproduksjonen ble lavere n{\r a}r de ble uttrykt med GTP100 eller GWP* enn med GWP100. Det ble st{\o}rst reduksjon der utslipp fra selve husdyrholdet betydde mest for de totale utslippene n{\r a}r det ble beregnet med GWP100. Dette var g{\r a}rder med lav ytelse per dyr og sm{\r a} innkj{\o}p av gj{\o}dsel og kraftf{\^o}r. Global oppvarming beregnet som kg CO2-ekvivalenter per kg EKM melk for {\o}kologisk drift ble redusert fra 87 \% av konvensjonelt drift til rundt 70 \% n{\r a}r CO2-ekvivalentene ble uttrykt med GTP100 eller GWP* i stedet for GWP100.
{\O}konomi. Gjennomsnittlig arbeidsinnsats og l{\o}nnsevne per storfeenhet og arbeidstime var omtrent lik for de to driftsformene. G{\r a}rdene med best {\o}konomisk resultat gjorde det best p{\r a} de globale milj{\o}indikatorene N-overskudd per produkt, energiintensitet og klimagassutslipp registrert som global oppvarmingseffekt m{\r a}lt med GWP100. Det var liten sammenheng mellom l{\o}nnsevne og nitrogenoverskudd per daa. 
Usikkerhet. Studien viser tydelig hvor mye modellutforming, usikkerhet i tilgjengelige g{\r a}rdsdata og valgte avgrensinger har {\r a} si for hvilken verdi ulike milj{\o}indikatorer f{\r a}r: Spesielt tydelig er dette n{\r a}r det gjelder valg av beregningsm{\r a}te for klimagassutslipp.}

        abstract = {In the last 20 years, the investigated farms have had either solely arable farming or crop rotations with grassland included. We do also present simple methods for assessment of soil quality for agricultural advisors and farmers. More carbon storage in soil is wanted to both remove CO2 from the atmosphere and enhance organic matter content, which improves the agronomic characteristics of the soil when it is low in organic matter. Crop rotations with grassland and fertilization, particularly with manure has been seen upon as measures to enhance the content of organic matter and thus carbon storage in soil. However, there have been done few investigations on this in silty and sandy soils. We have chosen Surnadal and S{\o}r-{\O}sterdal and Sol{\o}r areas because there are farms with silty sand in both those areas and because they are placed in two different climatic zones (coast and domestic climate). Both places have farms with solely arable farming and farms with grasslands in the crop rotation. We selected eight farms in each of two areaes. In Surnadal there were four arable farms and four farms with also grasslands in the crop rotation. In S{\o}r-{\O}sterdal and Sol{\o}r there were less differences in the crop rotations between farms with solely arable land and crop rotations with grassland included. The farms were fertilized with mineral fertilizer and animal manure, mainly slurry from cattle or pig. On the farms with grassland included in crop rotation there were none that only used mineral fertilizer. On each farm two fields with cereals 2020 were chosen. On each of these fields two sample areas were selected where we investigated soil physical, biological, and chemical parameters. The period of sample collection lasted from August until October 2020, and it was in all farms done shortly after the cereal was threshed.
We observed a clear trend with more organic carbon, better soil aggregate formation and aggregate stability, more rapid transformation of organic matter and more earthworms with grasslands included than by solely arable farming. Isolated, many of these factors are not significantly different, but together they showed a pattern with better soil conditions when grassland is included in crop rotations. For the factors root depth, penetration depth, soil infiltration, soil pore volume, POXC-carbon and soil respiration, the difference between solely arable farming and when grassland is included, is not so clear. One could assume that a part of the differences between farms with and without grassland in crop rotation could be explained by more manure used in farms with grassland, but that is not the case. Contradictory, on some of the arable farms larger quantities of animal manure was used than on the farms with grasslands included. However, we observed that fertilization with animal manure increased carbon storage, improved aggregate stability, and enhanced soil respiration on arable farms.
We recommend the spade as the best tool to judge soil structure, dense layers, root growth, content of earthworms and degradation of plant material from last year. This can be supplemented with various simple methods like digging down a piece of cotton cloth, or a tea bag and then examining how much is left a few months later. Penetrometers and infiltration measurements can provide valuable information, but moisture conditions and soil type must be considered in the assessments. Bouncing tails and other small insects can be caught in a trap and counted. There are several simple microbiological tests under development such as Pasco CO2 sensor, Solvita basal CO2 and Microbiometer. We will gather more experience before we make recommendations on them.},

        abstract = {Menneskeheten st{\r a}r overfor store utfordringer, bla. global oppvarming og tap av naturmangfold og artenes leveomr{\r a}der. Rapporten omhandler noen aspekter ved {\o}kologisk b{\ae}rekraft hvor {\o}kologisk landbruk har hatt en spydspiss-funksjon for alt landbruk siden driftsformen ble etablert for rundt 100 {\r a}r siden. I denne rapporten defineres {\o}kologisk som ?sertifisert {\o}kologisk driftsform?. Det som ofte kalles konvensjonelt landbruk, har vi kalt ikke-{\o}kologisk i den betydning at det ikke er sertifisert som {\o}kologisk landbruk. Dette fordi det er veldig mange ulike m{\r a}ter {\r a} drive landbruk p{\r a} som bare har det til felles at de godkjenner bruk av kunstgj{\o}dsel og kjemisk/syntetiske plantevernmidler. Noen har forsiktig bruk av disse innsatsmidlene og tar i bruk mange av de agronomiske metodene som ogs{\r a} anbefales i {\o}kologisk landbruk, mens andre driver sv{\ae}rt intensivt.
Framover b{\o}r {\o}kologisk landbruk fortsatt v{\ae}re en spydspiss. Ved videreutvikling av driftsformen er det n{\o}dvendig {\r a} holde fast p{\r a} de fire prinsippene for {\o}kologisk landbruk. Rapporten omfatter ogs{\r a} omr{\r a}der hvor {\o}kologisk landbruk trenger {\r a} videreutvikles, bla. innenfor plantenes n{\ae}ringsforsyning, global oppvarming, produksjon og forbruk av energi og mulige tiltak for dette. Til slutt diskuterer vi hva som trengs for {\r a} f{\r a} en {\o}kologisk b{\ae}rekraftig utvikling av driftsformen.
I rapporten defineres b{\ae}rekraftig utvikling slik: ?B{\ae}rekraftig utvikling er en utvikling som im{\o}tekommer dagens behov uten {\r a} forringe mulighetene for kommende generasjoner til {\r a} f{\r a} dekket sine behov? (Verdenskommisjonen for milj{\o} og utvikling 1987). Et viktig utgangspunkt for driftsformen, som n{\r a} kalles {\o}kologisk landbruk p{\r a} norsk, var {\o}nske om god jordfruktbarhet. Dette medf{\o}rte blant annet at mineralsk nitrogengj{\o}dsel og kjemisk/syntetiske spr{\o}ytemidler ikke ble tatt i bruk. Jordfruktbarhet, som i dag inng{\r a}r som en del av det som ofte omtales som jordhelse, er fortsatt viktig for dem som driver {\o}kologisk. Tilf{\o}rsel av organisk materiale, redusert kj{\o}rebelastning, levende plantedekke og vekstskifte er viktige tiltak innen {\o}kologisk landbruk for {\r a} fremme jordhelsa. De fleste studiene som sammenligner jordhelse ved {\o}kologisk og ikke-{\o}kologisk driftsform finner at det er mer mikrobiell biomasse og biologisk aktivitet i jorda, og at innholdet av jordkarbon er h{\o}yere ved {\o}kologisk drift. Ved bruk av tiltak for god jordhelse ogs{\r a} i ikke-{\o}kologisk drift blir noen av forskjellene mellom driftsformene redusert.
Det er ikke tillatt {\r a} bruke kjemisk/syntetiske spr{\o}ytemidler i {\o}kologisk drift. Bruk av slike midler, bla. mot ugras, sopp og insekter, eller som vekstregulering, utgj{\o}r en viktig forskjell mellom ikke-{\o}kologisk og {\o}kologisk landbruk. Rester av disse midlene finnes igjen i vann, jord og luft. Blant annet fant JOVA- programmet 78 ulike midler i 10 norske nedb{\o}rsfelt. Flere unders{\o}kelser har p{\r a}vist direkte og indirekte skadelige effekter p{\r a} organismer som lever i vann, jord og luft, f.eks. ferskvannstanglopper, fugler, flaggermus, mus, frosk, bier, biller og andre jordorganismer. Vekstskifte, frav{\ae}r av kjemisk/syntetiske spr{\o}ytemidler og begrensa nitrogengj{\o}dsling i {\o}kologisk landbruk gir ogs{\r a} grunnlag for et stort biologisk mangfold. Unders{\o}kelser viser at det jevnt over blir observert flere individer og arter av fugler, insekter, edderkopper og planter i {\o}kologisk sammenlignet med i ikke-{\o}kologisk drift. Det er st{\o}rst forskjell mellom de to driftsmetodene i intensive {\r a}kerlandskap. Begrensinger p{\r a} import av gj{\o}dsel og f{\^o}r gj{\o}r at det gjennomg{\r a}ende tilf{\o}res mindre n{\ae}ring i {\o}kologisk enn i ikke-{\o}kologisk landbruk. God agronomi som sikrer god utnytting av tilf{\o}rt n{\ae}ring, er derfor avgj{\o}rende for {\r a} kunne f{\r a} gode avlinger. Unders{\o}kelser viser at n{\ae}ringsstoff-effektiviteten p{\r a} husdyrbruk som regel er bedre ved {\o}kologisk drift, mens det ofte er motsatt ved dyrking av ett{\r a}rige vekster som korn.
For {\r a} sikre en fortsatt b{\ae}rekraftig utvikling m{\r a} {\o}kologisk landbruk ta nye grep for {\r a} m{\o}te dagens {\o}kologiske utfordringer. N{\ae}ringsforsyning, global oppvarming, produksjon og forbruk av energi og matforsyning er omr{\r a}der hvor det er viktig {\r a} tenke nytt p{\r a} grunn av globale, nasjonale og lokale utfordringer knyttet til disse omr{\r a}dene. Det er et m{\r a}l {\r a} resirkulere n{\ae}ringsstoff fra storsamfunnet tilbake som gj{\o}dsel, men dette er utfordrende blant annet p{\r a} grunn av risiko for innhold av u{\o}nskede stoffer, ?nisser p{\r a} lasset?. Mange som driver {\o}kologisk landbruk bruker husdyrgj{\o}dsel fra ikke-{\o}kologisk landbruk. Fortsatt avhengighet av slik gj{\o}dsel vil true driftsformens troverdighet. Biologisk nitrogenbinding, vekstskifte og fangvekster og god husdyrgj{\o}dselhandtering er viktige n{\o}kler for {\r a} redusere behovet for slik gj{\o}dselimport. Det er viktig med mer arbeid for {\r a} sikre en {\o}kologisk forsvarlig resirkulering av n{\ae}ring fra samfunnet, inkludert restr{\r a}stoff fra havet. Struvitt er et interessant produkt som utvinnes i kloakkrenseanlegg og er nylig godkjent for bruk i {\o}kologisk produksjon. Det er imidlertid et mineralsk produkt, uten organisk materiale. Dersom {\o}kologisk landbruk skal v{\ae}re et alternativ som bidrar til b{\ae}rekraftig utvikling, m{\r a} vi ta klimaforandringene p{\r a} alvor. Lave utslipp av klimagasser per produsert enhet og vedlikehold av innholdet av karbon i jorda er n{\o}dvendig. Samtidig m{\r a} driftsformen v{\ae}re motstandsdyktig mot kraftig regn og t{\o}rke. Unders{\o}kelser p{\r a} g{\r a}rder som driver {\o}kologisk melkeproduksjon viser at det er stor variasjon i energibruk og energiintensitet mellom g{\r a}rdene, noe som tyder p{\r a} at lavere energibruk er mulig p{\r a} mange g{\r a}rder. Ved {\r a} erstatte fossil energi med fornybar energi kan det fossile avtrykket reduseres. Imidlertid har all energiproduksjon negative milj{\o}effekter.
De store {\o}konomiske utfordringene og tidspresset som alt landbruk er preget av, p{\r a}virker ogs{\r a} de som {\o}nsker {\r a} drive {\o}kologisk. For {\r a} oppn{\r a} {\o}kt {\o}kologisk b{\ae}rekraft trenger vi et {\o}kologisk landbruk som videreutvikles p{\r a} en realistisk gjennomf{\o}rbar m{\r a}te ut fra forsvarlig ressursforvaltning, biodiversitet, klima og milj{\o}, og i en retning som underst{\o}tter {\o}kologiske systemer og kretsl{\o}psprinsipper. En landbrukspolitikk som stimulerer til dette vil gj{\o}re det enklere {\r a} sikre at det {\o}kologiske landbruket utvikler seg i en {\o}kologisk, mer b{\ae}rekraftig retning. Det trengs ogs{\r a} gode agronomer, dyktige husdyrbrukere og folk som er villige til {\r a} g{\r a} foran, tenke nytt og g{\r a} dypt inn i agronomien, {\o}kologien og {\o}konomien.},

        abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in investigating whether the organic food production and consumption result in better environmental profile compared to conventional food. To assess and compare environmental impact of organic food with conventional food as well as to assess impact of life cycle assessment (LCA) methodological choices, this meta-analysis systematically analysed 104 published studies on both animal and plant products. This was done comparing eight impact categories of global warming (GWP), acidification, eutrophication, eco-toxicity potential, biodiversity loss, energy, water and land use for both mass- and area-based functional units from cradle-to-farm gate. The review shows that the majority of studies have been performed in Europe and North America, with a large focus on GWP and little focus on biodiversity loss, eco-toxicity potential and water use. Only few studies included the effect on soil carbon sequestration for estimation of GWP or direct land use change, and such studies were more recent. The meta-analysis showed variation within the results across different studies due to differences in compared systems and research methods. The only impacts that were found to differ significantly between the two production modes were lower GWP per area unit plus higher land use and lower energy use per mass unit for organic compared to conventional food. The key methodological challenges in LCA of food products are to develop methodologies to assess biodiversity, toxicity and land degradation and to improve models for better estimation of changes in soil carbon especially for organic food. Furthermore, the choice of the functional unit can affect the results. Therefore, including several functional units for LCA of organic food and assessing their impacts in a dietary context are required. Including results both at the product and diet level might therefore provide more holistic assessments and allow more comprehensive decisions.}

        abstract = {A sustainable way to enhance overall food production is to increase the exploitation of subsoil resources
with deep roots. In this regard, intercropping is highly recommended to maintain agricultural systems,
because it can increase the soil exploitation, especially when using deep-rooted crops. Various root
measurement techniques help to understand the importance of roots and their role in intercropping. In this
work, there are two main objectives: (i) to study methods that enable the distinction of roots and root
function of plant species grown in mixed cropping; and (ii) to investigate the root interaction and resource
competition in intercropping systems.
The methods used for distinguishing roots and root function in intercropping systems were qPCR,
amplicon sequencing, 15N tracer uptake, and anatomical techniques. Experiments were conducted to study
the root competition between legume and non-legume mixtures under semi-field conditions, and various
stands of mixed crops in strip intercropping in the field. The root studies were conducted by direct visual
distinction in rhizotron tubes, by determining uptake of labeled nitrogen, and by root excavation followed
by different analyses.
It is concluded that several methods can be used to distinguish roots from different species in
intercropping systems. By the use of the DNA-based methods, qPCR and amplicon sequencing, it was
possible to quantify root fractions from root mixtures in intercropping. Root activity of individual species
of crops in the mixtures could also be detected by 15N tracer uptake. Additionally, microscopy with a
suitable staining method further allowed reliable differentiation among species by studying differences in
root anatomy. Finally, the use of red-colored roots also allowed for differentiation between two species
grown in intercropping systems, observed via direct visual observations and by using root imaging
techniques. The observations on belowground interactions in strip intercropping of different crop species
in this study could be useful as a guidance and to provide profound understanding about the mechanisms
that are responsible for the yield advantages of intercropping systems, crop design, and optimization of
agronomic choices in intercropping systems.}

Red beet (Beta vulgaris L. cv Detroit) and lucerne (Medicago sativa L. cv Creno) were grown in one-meter-high transparent tubes. Root competition was studied by direct observation on the tube surface determining root intensity (RI), root wash and extraction followed by determination of root length density (RLD), and DNA-based methods. Intercropping decreased lucerne RI strongly, whereas the RI of red beet was not affected. The determination of RLD did not allow us to distinguish species in mixed samples. However, both DNA methods showed apparently a tendency to overestimate the fraction of lucerne roots compared to the direct root observations. The discrepancy between methods was explained by the fact that visual methods provide estimates of root length while the DNA methods provide estimates of root mass. In conclusion, DNA-based estimates of species fractions in mixed root samples give valuable information on root interactions in mixed crops.},

However, urbanization leads to limited knowledge of farming and farm animal welfare. Consumers believe organic farming leads to better animal welfare, although most health and welfare issues seen in conventional systems are also found in organic poultry systems. The majority of consumers do not translate attitude and good intention into action, the actual purchase of organic products. Understanding this intention-behaviour gap may lead to increased sales of organic products. Effective communication and education can create trust, added additional values and credibility, and may lead to structured perceptions, convictions, values, norms, knowledge and interests and lead to better understanding of organic farming and farm animal welfare. Merchandising strategies can reduce barriers the consumer may encounter at the moment of decision making.},

We conducted qualitative interviews with farmers to explore relations between rearing practices, farmers? objectives and farm characteristics. Our results indicate that this innovation is based on a few elements: (1) it is inseparable from a global rearing system based on pasture, (2) it fits with farmers? production and economic goals and (3) it can be adapted to each farm.}

        abstract = {Der Umgang der Gesellschaft mit Umweltschutz und Umweltzerst{\"o}rung hat sich l{\"a}ngst zu einer sozialen Frage entwickelt. Diese betrifft auf der Mikroebene die differenzierte Problemwahrnehmung in unterschiedlichen Bev{\"o}lkerungsgruppen, das Erkennen von pers{\"o}nlichem Handlungsbedarf und die allt{\"a}gliche Umsetzung in konkreten Handlungsfeldern. Eng verbunden damit ist die soziale Integration in Gruppen, in denen bestimmte Umweltnormen selbstverst{\"a}ndlich gelten oder zumindest thematisiert werden. Ob unter den vielf{\"a}ltigen Teilnahmem{\"o}glichkeiten beispielsweise ein Bioladen im Wohnort frequentiert wird, geht weit {\"u}ber infrastrukturelle und finanzielle Aspekte hinaus, wenn die pers{\"o}nliche Wertsch{\"a}tzung und die Perzeption der von Umweltgruppen ? respektive Betreibern von Biol{\"a}den - kommunizierten Ideen betrachtet werden. Trotz des Booms dieses Themas seit den 1970er Jahren, sind die Umweltbewegungen in ihrer Rolle als Produzenten eines sozialen Wandels bis auf wenige Ausnahmen Nischenbewegungen geblieben. Eine dieser Bewegungen ist die 1984 in Oberbayern gegr{\"u}ndete Erzeuger- Verbrauchergemeinschaft TAGWERK. Sie f{\"o}rdert eine ressourcenschonende landwirtschaftliche Produktion und den Einkauf der auf diese Weise erzeugten Lebensmittel und ist so eine der vielf{\"a}ltigen kleinteiligen Reaktionen auf die {\"o}kologischen Probleme der Gegenwart. Ihr Interesse lag nicht in der Organisation spektakul{\"a}rer Massenprotestaktionen, sondern sie setzt an der allt{\"a}glichen, routinierten Handlung Lebensmitteleinkauf an. Aus der Perspektive der Umweltbewegung sind Initiativen wie TAGWERK ein ?wichtiger Motor, der gesellschaftliche Ver{\"a}nderungen in Richtung {\"o}kologische Modernisierung in Gang setzen kann? (DIEKMANN/PREISEND{\"O}RFER 2001:148). Im Rahmen des Nachhaltigkeitsdiskurses und der daraus hervorgehenden Handlungsempfehlungen, stehen solche Initiativen heute als innovative und nachahmenswerte Beispiele f{\"u}r eine {\"o}ko-sozial orientierte Lebens- und Wirtschaftsweise (vgl. HELD 1998, BUND/MISEREOR 1997, {\"O}KOM 1998). Dagegen bemerkt MENZEL (1998:19) an den neuen sozialen Bewegungen ihre Verweigerung, die kommunizierten Ideen zu einem neuen Paradigma zu machen. Seiner Meinung nach geben sich die Gruppen mit kleinen L{\"o}sungen zufrieden. Fehlt dieses Paradigma tats{\"a}chlich, so bleibt es fraglich, ob eine Multiplikation der kleinen Modelle die erwarteten gro{\ss}en Ver{\"a}nderungen herbeif{\"u}hrt. 

Mit dem Ziel der Erhaltung bzw. neuen Etablierung lokaler Kreisl{\"a}ufe und m{\"o}glichst hoher Transparenz von der Produkterzeugung bis zur Vermarktung m{\"o}chte TAGWERK sein Einzugsgebiet nicht beliebig ausweiten. {\"U}ber das blo{\ss}e Produkt hinaus sind die Erzeugnisse Tr{\"a}ger der TAGWERK-Ideen und als solche im Handel nicht beliebig plazierbar. Integration und Ausgrenzung von Verbrauchern entstehen weit {\"u}ber das Wissen hinaus durch eine gef{\"u}hlsm{\"a}{\ss}ige N{\"a}he bzw. Distanz zur Idee. Dies betrifft in starkem Ma{\ss}e deren nicht aktiv kommunizierte Teile. So lange die Ideen nicht in einen Rahmen eingebettet sind, der den Bed{\"u}rfnissen gr{\"o}{\ss}erer Bev{\"o}lkerungsgruppen entspricht, unterliegen sie der Gefahr, zu Leerformeln zu werden. M{\"o}chte TAGWERK in Zukunft mehr Breitenwirkung erzielen, ist eine {\"A}nderung der Kommunikationsstrategie unabdinglich. Die Verbreitung der Idee erfolgt {\"u}ber einen aufkl{\"a}rerischen, vernunft- und wissensbasierten Ansatz. Das Bild des Verbrauchers zeigt den bewussten, aufgekl{\"a}rten, sich {\"u}ber gedruckte Information eine Meinung bildenden Menschen, der sein Handeln {\"u}berwiegend an aktiv angeeignetem Wissen ausrichtet. Da die TAGWERK-Aktivisten glauben, dass Verbraucher f{\"u}r eine Verhaltens{\"a}nderung den gleichen Weg wie sie selber beschreiten, praktiziert TAGWERK zur Kommunikation der Ideen Formen der kognitiven Mobilisierung. Ziel dieser Mobilisierung ist, {\"u}ber Aufkl{\"a}rung und Wissen die Gedanken und Einstellungen der Konsumenten so zu orientieren, das sie aus eigenem Antrieb ihre Verhaltensmuster {\"a}ndern. Die Gruppe der Gr{\"u}ndergeneration ist selbstreferentiell, selbstbestimmt, experimentierfreudig und sie ist getrieben von der eigenen Entwicklungsf{\"a}higkeit. Die Selbstcharakterisierung als Pionier wird sehr stark auch zur Unterscheidung von den Konkurrenten im Naturkostsektor gew{\"a}hlt. In der Pioniersituation dr{\"u}ckt sich nach wie vor f{\"u}r die TAGWERKaktivisten die umfassende Idee aus, die aus eigener Sicht konsequent und aus eigener Leistung umgesetzt wird. Vor allem auf die F{\"o}rdermittel, die den jungen Regionalvermarktungsinitiativen zur Verf{\"u}gung stehen, reagiert die Gruppe zwiesp{\"a}ltig. Die bisherige Selbstbestimmung gab Kraft und Dynamik f{\"u}r den Eigenantrieb und die Aktivierung eigener Ressourcen. Zunehmend f{\"u}hlt sich die Gruppe aber durch den Druck der Kunden nach einem anderen Sortiment sowie dem Preisdruck durch die lokale Konkurrenz und durch {\"O}kobilligmarken fremdbestimmt. In dieser Situation l{\"o}st die F{\"o}rderung der anderen Initiativen {\"A}ngste, etwas Neid, aber auch Trotz aus. Eine der Folgen davon ist, dass die Darstellung der eigenen St{\"a}rke haupts{\"a}chlich in der Binnensicht erfolgt. {\"U}ber die an die Produkte gekoppelte Idee unterscheidet sich TAGWERK erheblich von den neu entstehenden Biosuperm{\"a}rkten, die eine vergleichbare Produktpalette anbieten. Diese Unternehmen treten jedoch mit {\"u}berwiegend wirtschaftlichen Zielen auf dem Markt auf. Die Vordenker tragen damit die hohen Kosten ihrer eigenen Ideen alleine. Sie empfinden heute den Druck, zu (re)agieren, sich zu rechtfertigen und sich deutlich abzugrenzen. },

Heilmittel sind danach die Ver{\"a}nderung der Anreizstrukturen und die Ver{\"a}nderung sozialer Normen und Werte. Dabei wird von den imagin{\"a}ren Antwortenden auch sehr klar vorgef{\"u}hrt, wer denn sein Handeln und die dazugeh{\"o}rigen Grunddispositionen ver{\"a}ndern soll. Es sind die Verbraucher im Allgemeinen, die Politik und die Industrie.
Ein zentrales Thema der Umweltsoziologie ist die kulturelle Wahrnehmung von sozial produzierten Umweltproblemen und die Analyse der entsprechenden Reaktionen zur L{\"o}sung dieser Probleme. Im Bereich Landwirtschaft werden in dieser Hinsicht die {\"A}nderungen der Agrarstruktur, Emissionen, Tierschutz, Abnahme der Artenvielfalt und die Transportproblematik diskutiert. Als ein Mittel, auf diese Probleme zu reagieren, steht in den Jahren 2002 und 2003 die Umsetzung des Bundesprogramms {\"O}kologischer Landbau auf der Agenda. Eine der Zielsetzungen ist, dass die Nachfrage nach Bio-Produkten durch die Verbraucher deutlich ansteigt. Gegenstand des Seminars war daher die Frage, wie dieses politische Ziel erreicht werden kann. Die Studierenden erhielten die Aufgabe, entsprechend des Modells der Sinus-Milieus zielgruppenspezifische Ma{\ss}nahmen zur Erh{\"o}hung der Nachfrage nach Lebensmitteln aus {\"O}kologischem Anbau auszuarbeiten. Danken m{\"o}chten wir an dieser Stelle den 27 Studierenden aus den Forst-, Agrar- und Gartenbauwissenschaften, die an dem Seminar teilgenommen haben.

        abstract = {In the original ridge tillage system as practiced in the US Corn Belt, ridges are formed during the growing season. Several studies have documented that this can reduce leaching of nutrients and improve fertilizer efficiency. This study was conducted to determine whether ridges formed in autumn can be used as an alternative to ploughing to reduce N leaching during autumn and winter, and thereby increase growth and N uptake of a subsequent unfertilized crop. A factorial field experiment with tillage and residues as factors was conducted during 1998-2000. Tillage treatments were autumn ridging and ploughing. Residue treatments were stubble, stubble+straw and stubble+liquid manure in order to create a gradient of C/N ratios. From the time of harvest until planting of a subsequent barley crop (Hordeum vulgare L.), inorganic N was determined 11 times in 1998-1999 and 10 times in 1999-2000 in the 0-10, 10-30, 30-60 and 60-90 cm soil layers. Growth and N uptake of barley was quantified 9 times in both 1999 and 2000. Barley grain and straw yields were determined. 
Ridging resulted in lower levels of inorganic N in the 30-90 cm soil layer in November and a significantly higher level of inorganic N in the 0-30 cm soil layer in late April, indicating reduced leaching and increased N availability for the subsequent crop. Ridging significantly increased growth, yield and N uptake of barley whereas incorporation of straw generally reduced growth, yield and N uptake. It is concluded that ridging in autumn has a N conserving effect and it is suggested that the potential of ridging in autumn as an alternative to ploughing is further investigated in detailed studies of solute movement, N immobiliza-tion/mineralization and crop performance. }

        abstract = {Farming business is like any other business constantly challenged by the changing demands and expectations from the surroundings ? farming even may be more explicitly due to the comprehensive regulation and public support through subsidies within the Europe Union. The development of sustainable farming system has been a main challenge until now, where particular focus has been put on the environmental impact and how to farm without unacceptable environmental impacts. Research and developments efforts included decision support tools for farm management in relation to environmental impact (c.f. Halberg et al., 2005), and the interaction between land use for farming, landscape and ecological services has been subject to considerable efforts (c.f. Gibbon, 2005). At present the societal expectations to farming is moving from a demand for ?environmental sustainable farming practise? to an expectation that farming should be able to contribute significantly (more) to the development of rural areas. This can be translated into an expectation of multifunctionality of farming. At the same time European food production, as it takes place now is, under heavy pressure from food production in other parts of the world. Therefore, it is also in the interest of at least some farmers to look for other ways of generating income. So, for several reasons it will be important for many farmers to adapt to such expectations and opportunities. This calls for efforts to better understand development possibilities of farms in relation to multifunctionality and understand the possible role of different farming?s practises in relation to rural development. 

Until now such efforts have only been given little attention in mainstream agricultural research. May be because multifunctionality to a high degree needs to be considered site-specific and includes a major normative component. However, also ?environ-mental sustainable farming? includes a major normative component due to the variety of (complex) impacts of farming on the environment (i.e. if the impact is considered local or global, or considered in the short term or the long term). Therefore, it seems appropriate to draw on the past experiences of methods to improve the environmental performance of farming in exploring the multifunctional performance of farming. The purpose of this paper is to present our experiences in researching farmers possibilities and motivation to adapt to more environmental sustainable systems and ? based on these experiences ? to suggest how an intensified effort in researching multifunctional farming systems appropriately could take place.

        abstract = {I {\o}kologisk svineproduktion som den foreg{\r a}r i Danmark i dag, har s{\o}er p{\r a} friland i vid udstr{\ae}kning mulighed for at udf{\o}re naturlig adf{\ae}rd. B{\r a}de s{\o}er og slagtesvin f{\r a}r tildelt grovfoder, har relativt meget plads at bev{\ae}ge sige p{\r a} og har adgang til friland og udend{\o}rs arealer. Disse fordele menes at v{\ae}re basis for det lave antibiotikaforbrug der ses i den {\o}kologiske svineproduktion (Bonde \& S{\o}rensen, 2004; Edwards, 2005). 
Der er imidlertid ogs{\r a} en r{\ae}kke ulemper af milj{\o}- og velf{\ae}rdsm{\ae}ssig karakter knyttet til is{\ae}r den {\o}kologiske slagtesvineproduktion. Stort set alle slagtesvin kommer p{\r a} stald i forbindelse med frav{\ae}nning, hvor de har adgang til udend{\o}rsarealer med beton underlag (Hermansen et al., 2005). Dermed har grisene ikke samme mulighed for at udf{\o}re naturlig adf{\ae}rd s{\r a}som eksempelvis rodeadf{\ae}rd, som ved frilandsproduktion. Desuden tildeles slagtesvinene betydelige m{\ae}ngder kraftfoder i form af bl.a. proteinfoder og korn. G{\r a}r grisene p{\r a} friland bidrager det til en kraftig n{\ae}ringsstofbelastning, og dermed for{\o}ges risikoen for kv{\ae}lstoftab til omgivelserne (Eriksen \& Kristensen 2001; Sommer et al., 2001; Hermansen et al. 2004; Quintern \& Sundrum 2006). Kun ca. 30 \% af det kv{\ae}lstof som slagtesvin indtager med foderet tilbageholdes i grisene indtil slagtning (Eriksen et al., 2006). Studier har vist et kv{\ae}lstof overskud per hektar p{\r a} 270 kg N med 71 grise ha-1 (Salomon et al., 2007) og 388 og 507 kg N ha-1 i systemer med 91 grise ha-1 hvor der fodres henholdsvis restriktivt og ad libitum (Eriksen et al., 2006). 
I teorien vil det v{\ae}re muligt at reducere den {\o}kologiske svineproduktions n{\ae}ringsstofbelastning samt i endnu h{\o}jere grad give grisene mulighed for at udf{\o}re naturlig adf{\ae}rd ved at {\o}ge grisenes indtag af f{\o}de fra de arealer de beslagl{\ae}gger. Udgangspunktet er grisens opportunistiske alt{\ae}dende natur og dens unikke evne til at fouragere b{\r a}de under og over jordoverfladen (Andresen, 2000; Beattie \& O?Connell, 2002). Tidligere studier har vist, at dr{\ae}gtige s{\o}er kan hente op til 60 \% af deres n{\ae}ringsbehov ved afgr{\ae}sning af kl{\o}vergr{\ae}s (Fernandez et al., 2006). I nylige fors{\o}g er det fundet, at slagtesvin kan hente 20-25 \% af deres energibehov ved fouragering p{\r a} kl{\o}vergr{\ae}s (Kongsted \& Therkildsen, 2014) og lucerne (Jakobsen og Kongsted, 2014) samt op til 60 \% ved fouragering p{\r a} jordskokker (Kongsted et al., 2013), s{\r a}fremt de fodres restriktivt med kraftfoder. Det giver en 10-60 \% bedre ?foderudnyttelse? vurderet som kg kraftfoder per kg tilv{\ae}kst, men samtidig en reduktion i tilv{\ae}kst. Tilsvarende tyder det p{\r a}, at protein indtaget fra afgr{\ae}sset lucerne kan udg{\o}re op til 40 \% af slagtesvins samlede proteinindtag ved fouragering p{\r a} en veletableret lucernemark (Jakobsen, 2014). Fors{\o}gsresultaterne demonstrerer et potentiale for at reducere forbruget af kraftfoder i {\o}kologisk svineproduktion ved i h{\o}jere grad at t{\ae}nke direkte fouragering ind i svines{\ae}dskiftet. 
Det er imidlertid uvist, hvilke konsekvenser det har for den samlede bedrifts milj{\o}aftryk og {\o}konomi, at slagtesvinene i h{\o}jere grad integreres i s{\ae}dskiftet. Form{\r a}let med n{\ae}rv{\ae}rende rapport er at analysere og vurdere de produktions- og milj{\o}m{\ae}ssige samt {\o}konomiske resultater ved tre forskellige systemer: 
1) S{\o}er p{\r a} kl{\o}vergr{\ae}s og slagtesvin p{\r a} stald
2) S{\o}er og slagtesvin p{\r a} kl{\o}vergr{\ae}s
3) S{\o}er p{\r a} kl{\o}vergr{\ae}s og slagtesvin p{\r a} jordskokker, lucerne og kl{\o}vergr{\ae}s

Daraus ergibt sich die Verpflichtung f{\"u}r alle Beteiligten, die Integrit{\"a}t von Bio-Produkten zu gew{\"a}hrleisten. Massenbilanzen von Warenfl{\"u}ssen entlang der Lieferkette sind daf{\"u}r ein einfaches und verl{\"a}ssliches Instrument zur Betrugsverhinderung und -bek{\"a}mpfung. Dazu sind digitale Fl{\"a}chen, Kultur- und Mengendaten sowie Transaktionsdaten der gehandelten Produkte erforderlich. Es bedarf keiner aufw{\"a}ndigen Labortechnik und Analytik oder Chargenr{\"u}ckverfolgbarkeit
Vorantreiben der digitalen Erfassung von Daten f{\"u}r die {\"O}kokontrolle und Dateninfrastruktur
Die F{\"o}rderung einer digitalen Infrastruktur f{\"u}r Kontrolle und Zertifizierung hat viele Vorteile, wie z.B. der Beitrag zur Betrugsbek{\"a}mpfung durch mehr Transparenz in den Wertsch{\"o}pfungsketten, Verschlankung der B{\"u}rokratie und durch einen verbesserten Datenaustausch im {\"O}kokontroll- und Zertifizierungssystem. Dazu k{\"o}nnen bereits vorhandene digitale Daten genutzt werden.
Verbesserung der Ertragsdatenerhebung {\"o}kologischer Betriebe
Ertragsdaten zum {\"o}kologischen Landbau werden nicht systematisch erhoben und sind daher l{\"u}ckenhaft. Kontrollstellen erheben zwar Ertr{\"a}ge f{\"u}r ihre Betriebe. Diese Information steht aber nur intern und meist nicht digital zur Verf{\"u}gung. Folglich stehen Daten nicht zeitnah zur Verf{\"u}gung, um sie f{\"u}r vorrausschauende Ertrags- und Marktsch{\"a}tzungen zu verwenden. Das Projekt empfiehlt konkrete Schritte, die wesentlich zur
Verbesserung der Datenverf{\"u}gbarkeit von {\"O}koertr{\"a}gen beitragen und eine realistische Sch{\"a}tzung der zu erwartenden Erntemengen erm{\"o}glichen w{\"u}rden.
Beitrag der Fernerkundung
Generell kann die Fernerkundung zur Verbesserung der Datengrundlage auch im {\"o}kologischen Landbau beitragen, indem sie wiederholt und unabh{\"a}ngig fl{\"a}chendeckende Informationen zum Zustand, zur Nutzung und deren Ver{\"a}nderung der Agrarlandschaft {\"u}ber gro{\ss}e Gebiete liefert und vorhandene zeitliche L{\"u}cken in bestehenden Daten schlie{\ss}t.
Einf{\"u}hrung eines digitalen Systems f{\"u}r Kontrolldaten und Massenbilanzierung
Die verpflichtende Einf{\"u}hrung eines digitalen Systems zur Erfassung und Darstellung von Kontrolldaten (GIS) sowie eines Massenbilanzierungssystems, um das Kontroll- und Zertifizierungssystem digital weiterzuentwickeln, w{\"u}rde dazu beitragen, Betrug mit Bio-Produkten zu verhindern und die Markttransparenz zu verbessern.}

F{\"u}r die deutsche Aquakultur setzt sich diese Produktion vor allem aus Karpfen und drei Forellenarten zusammen. Das vorliegende Projekt befasste sich mit einer tief greifenden Bestandsaufnahme von Produktions- und Marktbedingungen aus Produzentensicht per Vollerhebung und lieferte erstmals einen umfassenden {\"U}berblick f{\"u}r das Erhebungsjahr 2008. Die Erhebung bezog neben zertifizierten Betrieben auch solche ein, die aus verschiedenen Gr{\"u}nden ihre Zertifizierung nicht weiter f{\"u}hrten und half so, Schwachstellen aufzudecken. Von etwas weniger als 20 zertifizierten Unternehmen wurden 2008 etwa 100 t Karpfen und knapp {\"u}ber 80 Forellenartige produziert. Die Rahmenbedingungen der Produktion unterscheiden sich meist nicht von denen konventioneller Mitbewerber. Es gibt auch bei vielen {\"o}kologischen Aquakulturunternehmen eine Reihe von Produktionserschwernissen, die durch Umstellung nicht {\"u}berwindbar sind. Vor allem aber kristallisieren sich Probleme mit Erzielung eines kostendeckenden Marktpreises und Absatzes der kompletten Produktion heraus. Hierbei gibt es zwischen Karpfenz{\"u}chtern und Forellenproduzenten, aber auch im regionalen Rahmen erhebliche Unterschiede. Ein Problem ist ferner die N{\"a}he {\"o}kologischer Aquakultur zu herk{\"o}mmlichen Erzeugung, ein Umstand, der vom Kunden auch so kommuniziert wird. Die Analyse der Situation wurde mit einer Befragung konventioneller Forellenz{\"u}chter erg{\"a}nzt, die kl{\"a}ren sollte, warum {\"o}kologische Aquakultur sich bisher nicht in gr{\"o}{\ss}erem Umfang etabliert hat. Es zeigte sich unter anderem, dass {\"o}kologische Aquakultur hierzulande noch zu geringe wirtschaftliche Anreize bietet. Im Ergebnis der Arbeiten werden Vorschl{\"a}ge gemacht, die Basis f{\"u}r eine {\"A}nderung der vorgefundenen Situation sein k{\"o}nnten.

Poverty and food insecurity are common in the region, increasing population and land scarcity have induced the expansion of agricultural areas and consequent decline of land productivity due to soil erosion and land degradation. Local farmers have begun to practice agroforestry through the introduction of high value trees into traditional cropping systems with various combinations of timber, fruit, nut forage trees and annual crops. However, because of inherent production risks and many remaining uncertainties, assessing the long-term performance of agroforestry has remained challenging. We simulated prospective system benefits of agroforestry options by developing comprehensive and holistic models that aimed to explicitly consider all relevant risks and uncertainties. The initial findings reveal model components such as drought and frost and potential extreme weather events as the primary risks to agroforestry in the region. The analysis approach is a promising tool for ex-ante assessments of other planned interventions.},

The study began two years ago. The main focus is the analysis and research of eco-logical agriculture as a strategy to sustainable rural development. My con-tribution will be to show the experiences with ecological agriculture on a long time project in Mexico in the State of Tlaxcala. The village Vicente Guerrero is located in the high area of Tlaxcala-Country (2600 m above sea level, on the north-side of Mexico City). Most of the fields are located on the hillsides. Water erosion is a big problem for soil fertilization. Corn, beans, pumpkins and wheat are the typical crops in this area. The village people work on small farms of 2-5 hectare land holdings. The project for integrated rural development started in 1982. It?s target is to make envi-ronmental methods in agriculture save the employment of inhabitants and to consolidate the regional structure. This is the first time that it was ac-knowledged that there were negative results of the ?green revolution? in Tlaxcala. The harvest was lower and the cost of fertilizer and pesticides has increased. Also, the soil has eroded. At this moment, eight farmers of Vicente Guerrero went in for a class on soil protection and soil conserva-tion in Guatemala. This would be their first contact with the principles of ecological agriculture . After this course the farmers have started a consul-tation project in their own village and later for other farmers in the sur-rounding areas. Today eight advisors (2 women) are working with Vicente Guerrero. Many fields are being cultivated ecologically. Other responsibili-ties are the water management, feeding, traditional medicine, environ-mental education and national and international exchange of experiences. Here are some of the best demonstrations in the fields for normal living and some of the best examples of sustainable rural development.},

However, the Smart Mix concept has not yet been precisely defined, which has hindered its operationalization as a means of analyzing the governance of long and complex international supply chains. The aim of this contribution is to derive a working definition of Smart Mixes and use it to create and demonstrate a generalizable analytical tool that facilitates identification of whether a Smart Mix exists in an international supply chain. To address this aim, we reviewed existing literature on Smart Mixes to define the concept, which led to a three-step process for analyzing a supply chain. In a second stage, we demonstrate the process by applying it to the example of organic imports into Switzerland, using data from expert interviews and existing public documentation. The application showed that the governance of the organic sector in Switzerland related to imported products fulfils the criteria for it to be considered a Smart Mix that enables the Swiss Government to influence the behaviour of supply chain actors outside its jurisdiction. This example shows that the proposed Smart Mix concept is sound under particular circumstances: in this case, when the interests of the public and private sectors are aligned so that binding public measures provide protection to the private sector. These circumstances are not unique to organic imports into Switzerland, which allows the conclusion that Smart Mixes may provide sustainability solutions in other international supply chains.},

Several studies show that financial arguments should mean that more farms convert to organic production, which means that other reasons inhibit farmers from conversion. In this study, 24 organic and non-organic Swiss farmers were interviewed with the aim of identifying the barriers to conversion and learning how these have been overcome. The results suggest that the structural conditions for conversion are in place but a range of social factors create barriers. These factors include negative attitudes towards organic farming held by family members; problems with mutual acceptance between organic and non-organic farmers; technical reasons such as fear of weed infestation; and a fear of losing independence. Organic farmers however suggested that these barriers are overestimated. Farmers who are considering conversion are reluctant to ask for advice because this is seen as an irreversible step to conversion. This allows the conclusion that informal events and platforms that enable communication between organic and non-organic farmers could inspire farmers to take the first steps.}

        abstract = {Demonstrated economic benefits of conversion to organic agriculture, combined with solutions to technical and production-related problems, suggest that farmers in Switzerland should have converted in large numbers to organic production. However, the number of organic farms in Switzerland has remained virtually constant in the last 10 yr, so it appears there are other factors that influence the decision of whether or not to convert. Several studies have sought to identify the factors that influence the decisions by farmers whether or not to convert to organic, but have found a range of factors that appear to be context dependent, while others can be seen as context transcendent, which makes it difficult to draw generalizable conclusions. The aim of this study was to identify how Swiss farmers? decisions reflect the interaction of perceptions, relationships, policies and economic factors, which either enable or provide barriers to conversion. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2015 with 39 farmers of mixed and arable farms in the German- (n = 24) and French-speaking (n = 15) parts of Switzerland. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed according to their content. The results show that the decision of whether or not to convert relies on belief that technical problems have been sufficiently solved, as well as a range of social factors. Farmers perceive social pressure for them to be productive, but non-organic farmers often incorrectly perceive organic farming as not being oriented toward production. Furthermore, ?official? advice, which could correct this misperception, is sought about how, rather than whether, to convert and typically comes after farmers have made their decision. Major barriers in an area with a low density of organic farms are the lack of supply and delivery points within an acceptable travel distance, and lack of peer networks to provide informal support. On the basis of these findings, we propose that strategies to encourage conversion should be based around two main pillars: investment to create a network of supply and delivery points in areas with low density of organic farms; and actions, such as information events, to encourage dialogue between conventional and organic farmers to counteract feelings of ?us vs them?.},

The aim of this exploratory study is to address this research gap by identifying the characteristics of gardens and the management practices of gardeners that enhance the outcomes of gardening, which we separate into three dimensions: human wellbeing, biodiversity, and soil quality. Data were collected from 18 gardens in Zurich, Switzerland and a typology of gardeners was identified, which included ?conservationist?, ?functional?, ?minimum effort?, ?child-friendly?, and ?aesthetic? gardeners. The conservationist gardeners were found to have, on average, the highest species richness in their gardens, while the minimum effort gardeners had the lowest, which suggests that some degree of management can enhance species richness. The conservationist and minimum effort gardeners had, on average, the highest values for stable aggregates, while the minimum effort gardeners had the highest phosphorous content in their soil. The wellbeing of the minimum effort gardeners was lower than the other groups, which suggests it is the act of gardening, rather than merely having a garden, which leads to wellbeing outcomes. The results suggest that ecologically friendly gardening is compatible with desired social outcomes and furthermore that the beneficial effects of gardens are indeed related to the practices implemented by the gardeners, which are influenced by their attitudes towards gardening and the role of gardens in their lives.}

Porem, sofre criticas e tem sido apresentado como de balanco energetico negativo. O presente trabalho, realizado na UFPel em estufa plastica (7,8m x 39,4m) coberta com polietileno (0,15mm), avaliou a eficiencia energetica do cultivo do meloeiro (Cucumis melo L.) numa erspectiva agroecologica, contabilizando as entradas e saidas de energia. Os efeitos das adubacoes organica e mineral foram avaliados com oito tratamentos (parcelas de 6,0m2) e tres repeticoes. A mao-de-obra representou 100 h.homem'1.mes'1, ou 50\% da carga mensal de trabalho do agricultor. Os gastos energeticos na adubacao mineral (268,95 kcal.m'2) e organica completa (255,12 kcal.m'2) foram semelhantes. O menor custo do adubo organico foi onerado pelo maior gasto em frete e aplicacao. A produtividade de melao n{\~a}o apresentou diferenca significativa ao nivel de 5\% entre os tratamentos. O tratamento adubacao organica completa produziu 3,978 kg.m 2 e o tratamento adubacao mineral 3,060 kg.m'2. A produtividade media (da terra) foi de 3,12 kg.m'2 e da mao-de-obra foi de 4,52 kg.melao.h'1.homem'1. A efici{\^e}ncia energetica do sistema foi negativa, pois, para cada 1 kcal investida foi obtida em media 0,18 kcal de melao ou 0,45 kcal de biomassa total. A maior efici{\^e}ncia. foi obtida pelo tratamento adubacao organica completa: 0,23 para frutos e 0,53 para biomassa total. Os resultados permitem inferir que o aumento da eficiencia do agroecossistema estudado passa pela substituicao do substrato comercial por substrato alternativo a exemplo do solo, areia e vermicomposto, e do mulching com polietileno por palha, papel ou plastico reciclado, pois estes itens representaram 48\% do consumo energetico na producao de melao. A reciclagem de materiais pode aumentar a eficiencia: materiais metalicos da estrutura (13\% do insumo total medio) e plastico de cobertura (10\% do insumo total medio) se prestam para esta finalidade. Uma economia de 23\% no plastico pode ser obtida com o uso de lamina inteirica ao inves de laminas traspassadas. A substituicao do fitilho de polipropileno e adubo mineral por sisal e adubos organicos pode ser interessante, pois mesmo nao representando grande economia energetica sao renovaveis e de baixo custo ambiental. A producao dos adubos organicos na propriedade gera economia no gasto com frete. A eficiencia pode ser aumentada sensivelmente, pois os insumos podem ser reduzidos a menos da metade do custo atual.

A country needs around 25\% of its land to be covered by forest to maintain its ecological balance, but here the percentage is much less. Urban dwellers have hardly seen any greenery around them and every inch of land is occupied by various types of infrastructure. The solution lies in planting as many trees as possible, and the only place to do that seems to be on the rooftop or balcony and in slum areas. Vegetable production by the sack gardening method is an effective and innovative technology in Bangladesh. It has received positive attention from urban household communities. It is an alternative vegetable garden for utilizing small land areas or space. Individual families are growing many varieties of vegetables with minimum expenditure. After receiving the exciting research findings, the technology has increasingly been adopted among the urban people of some city areas such as Dhaka (capital and central), Sylhet (north-eastern) and Brahmanbaria districts (east-central) of Bangladesh in 2010-2011. It has been observed that urban people including slum dwellers have been showing keen interest in this method. Urban households are now able to grow and cook their own vegetables and have more diversity in their daily diet by growing highly nutritional products. The technology is possible for adoption and replication in other city areas both at home and abroad. }

Hence the most urgent concern is to make judicious use of chemical inputs and application of bio-products so as to ensure minimal damage to the environment without any reduction in yield of crops. 
Food security is also challenging considering the climate change, land degradation and natural disasters. Until recently, sustainable agricultural technologies are not highlighted as important both by the research institutions and by the policy makers. The country continues to be characterized by a large agrarian base, with more than three quarters of the population living in rural areas and roughly 80 percent of this population are living directly off the land or from agriculture related activities. Small farmers in Bangladesh are struggling to compete in today?s liberalized and globalised market place. This chapter will comment on importance of sustainable agricultural technologies for food security, environment and livelihood improvement in Bangladesh. },

Agriculture plays a very important role in populated countries like Bangladesh. Bangladesh ranks eighth in World population rank and fifth in Asia. The conventional agriculture of Bangladesh after green revolution heavily depended on chemical fertilizers and pesticides causing several problems to human health and the environment. As a result, food safety has now become a big issue. Moreover, the cost of agriculture has increased manifold with declining yield levels and growing dependence on market for purchase of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Hence the most urgent step is application of bio-products in order to ensure better and safe environment without any reduction in yield of crops.
Food security is also challenging considering the climate change, land degradation and natural disasters in the highly populated countries in Asia like Bangladesh. Small farmers in Bangladesh are struggling to compete with today?s liberalized and globalised market and do not get fair price of their product. Organic agriculture is considered to be a suitable agricultural production area to ensure harmonization between human welfare and sustainable development. It may be noted that organic issues are yet to be highlighted as an important agenda in the research institutions and by the policy makers. Organic products have good potential for export, the local market can also be important since many consumers are interested with food quality and food safety and eager to purchase with premium price with proper certification and labeling. To develop the organic agricultural sector in Bangladesh, government should develop appropriate policies, product standardization and support programs.
This paper will discuss the importance of organic agriculture in populated countries with few examples, overall opportunities and limitations of Bangladesh.

        abstract = {Diseases play an important role in rice production. In modern agriculture, application of hazardous chemicals is a common practice allover the world. But organic rice production system does not allow synthetic agro-chemicals due to its adverse effect on environment as well as human health. Thirty six fungal, twenty one viral, six bacterial and six nematode diseases have been recorded in rice. In Bangladesh, 31 rice diseases have been so far identified of which ten are considered as major. Sheath blight, blast, bakanae etc. are the major rice diseases in Bangladesh. Organic amendment works effectively under organic field production. Many researchers have already reported that application of silicon (Si) and potassium (K) reduce sheath blight and blast incidence. Plenty of different types of ashes are available in rural household and rice mills across the country which is the cheap source of Si and K. Application of ashes during final land preparation is a good practice for disease management. Farmer?s of northern region of Bangladesh are now applying rice mill ash in their field to control sheath blight disease. Hot water treatment of rice seeds at 54 0C is another option of successful control of bakanae disease and also to increase seedling vigor. 
Water management in rice field may be also an effective way of major disease control. Drain out the water helps decreasing sheath blight incidence. On the other hand, stagnant water helps decreasing blast incidence. Organic matter amendment in soil also helps decreasing brown spot disease of rice. There is a great scope on the development of Trichoderma based bio-fertilizer that may be used commercially for disease control and to increase rice yield. Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) has already developed BAU-bio-fungicides which are Trichoderma based. It needs to be commercialized for organic rice production.  
Research has been now underway to find an effective and low-cost disease management practice in organic rice production and exploring the performance of cow?s urine with water or butter milk and sweet flag (Acorus calamus) extract in this regard.

        abstract = {The feasibility of the rice-duck system of rice production, practiced in some East Asian countries, is studied in Bangladesh as a sub-project of the Poverty Elimination Through Rice Research Assistance (PETRRA). The Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) implements the sub-project in collaboration with two NGOs, FIVDB and BDS, in the northeastern (greater Sylhet) and southern (Barisal) regions of the country. Each demonstration trial, conducted in the field of the farmers, is treated as a replication. In these trials, the rice-duck system is compared with the methods of growing rice solely, as traditionally practiced by the farmers in Bangladesh. Evaluation of the activities carried out under the PETRRA sub-project shows that the rice-duck system is not only feasible, but also economically rewarding for the farmers. The yield of rice is, on average, 20\% higher in the rice-duck system than the traditional rice system (sole rice), thereby ensuring about 50\% higher net return and rice-provisioning ability. The ducks in the rice-duck fields control weeds and insects very effectively; as a consequence, labor and pesticide costs for controlling weeds and insects are minimized and the soil health is improved. The ducks provide another source of added income for the farmers. In view of the favorable results obtained in the study, it might be suggested that the rice-duck system be spread throughout the country as an income-generating activity for the resource-poor farmers.}

        abstract = {Direct sowing with non-woven fabric mulch is the new organic rice cultivation system. We studied the effect of topdressing on individual leaf photosynthesis at different position and grain yield in rice plants cultivated by this system. Leaf photosynthetic rate at the different leaf position per plant (P N-LP) of the third and fourth to lower leaves was higher when the topdressing amount was increased. Without topdressing or in no-fertilizers plots, the P N-LP values of lower leaves were very low. The leaf photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area (P N-LA) decreased gradually as the leaf position became lower. Again, the P N-LA values of the top-dressed plots at the lower leaves were higher than that of plots without topdressing or without fertilizers. The lower leaves maintained a higher P N because of a higher rate of nitrogen accumulation due to topdressing. The higher rate of photosynthesis in these leaves resulted in better root activity, which contributed to a better ripening percentage and ultimately higher rice grain yield.}

However, the mulching is very difficult, due to the muddy condition of the soil. Comparative studies were made to observe the effects of the timing of P \& L, that is, P \& L 10 days before mulching (P10) vs. P \& L 2 days before the mulching (P2), on the operator's physical stress, the rice growth, and grain yield. Basal fertilizer was applied 2 days before the mulching in the P2 treatment (P2-B2), and topdressing was applied at 29 days before heading in all treatments. For the P10 treatment, timing of the basal fertilization was set at 14 (P10-B14) or 3 (P10-B3) days before the mulching.
Results revealed that the timing of basal fertilization had no significant effect on the growth and grain yield between P10-B14 and P10-B3 treatments. The operator's physical stress was very low due to higher soil hardness in the P10-B14 treatment ; however the grain yield was 12\% lower than that of the P2-B2 treatment due to lower percentage of ripened grain. Because of the lower inorganic nitrogen of the soil, the growth of leaf area was suppressed and dry matter production was lower in the P10-B14 treatment, which resulted in lower percentage of ripened grain. To increase the grain yield of the P10-B14 treatment, future research is needed to consider the application amount and timing of topdressing, and also to reduce the gap between P \& L time and mulching.}

Usually huge quantities of vegetables, fishes, meats, and bones remain unutilized or thrown away as wastes in daily household affairs. However, kitchen wastes can also be used in productive manners. The ways and means of this endeavor has been addressed in this communication. The kitchen-waste based organic fertilizer has been developed by digging pits and placing the wastes on a layer of soil, topped by a layer of plant growth-promoting microbes. Almost 25\% of compost was harvested by this manner in small scale in Sylhet division (North-Eastern Bangladesh) under the auspicious of livelihood enhancement program. The main objectives were achieved by converting waste into resource, finding an alternative nutrient source for agricultural production, improving soil health and converting recycle elements to natural resources. Also, organic agriculture induced significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. At present, we are planning to produce consumable energy from kitchen wastes. Preliminary studies inspire optimism about their commercial usage, entrepreneurship for youths and improvement of environment. Finally, it is assuming that there are huge scope of application of kitchen wastes under the integrated solid waste management (ISWM) programs with its 4 R?s principle i.e. reduce, reuse, recycle and recovery of the waste with collection from both rural and urban areas for effective use for soil fertility and power energy development as a potential renewable energy source.}

        abstract = {In AuthenticFood a wide range of analytical methods have been developed and validated for authentication of organic plant products. These have been applied to plant samples from Danish and Italian field trials and independent test-set samples. It has been shown that several analytical methods have the potential to authenticate the geographical and/or the agricultural origin of plant products. Elemental fingerprint analysis is particularly suitable for revealing where a plant has been grown due to the inherently different soil mineralogy of geographical locations across Europe. When zooming in on individual elements by stable isotope analysis it is also possible to reveal how a plant has been fertilized ? especially when focusing on isotopes of specific plant compounds such as amino acids and oxygen containing anions. Metabolomic profiling has also proven valuable for discriminating between organic and conventional plant products when combined with multivariate statistics.}

The main objective of OrgTrace is to study the impact of different agricultural management practices relevant for organic farming on the ability of cereal and vegetable crops to absorb trace elements from the soil and to synthesize bioactive compounds (secondary metabolites, antioxidant vitamins and phytates) with health promoting effects. 

Based on different plant products produced in OrgTrace, diets were composed and the bioavailabilities of health promoting substances were analyzed in a human intervention study. Moreover, various health effects such as immune system responses were studied using rats as model organisms. 

OrgTrace is the first study, which follows selected elements and bioactive compounds all the way from the plant and soil system to absorption in the human body. All experimental studies have now been finalized and we are able to draw final conclusions.

The identification of appropriate stockless organic conversion strategies will help farmers and growers in their decision to convert to organic production. The current practice of a two-year red clover/ryegrass ley conversion relies on subsidies to be economically viable. This standard conversion and six alternatives were tested on a sandy loam soil entering organic conversion. A test crop of winter wheat will be grown across the entire experimental area in the first fully organic year (2001/2002). Strategies containing a legume ley phase returned the greatest amount of nitrogen to the soil. At the end of the second year, pre-cultivation, there were no differences in soil mineral nitrogen between strategies. Gross margins were greater from those strategies with cash cropping than those without, in spite of the generally depressed yields. Preliminary analysis suggests that growing red clover for seed in year 1 followed by a red clover ley in year 2 could be the most profitable option.},

A three year comprehensive comparative study on the performance of six pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) varieties on farmers? fields in Eastern and Southern Africa where intercropping with maize is normal practice, was undertaken. The varieties were tested for accumulation of dry matter (DM), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in all above-ground organs for three years under farmers? conditions. The study revealed that the latest introduced ICEAP 00040 outperformed all the other tested varieties (ICP 9145; ICEAP 00020, ICEAP 00053, ICEAP 00068, and a local variety called ?Babati White?) under farmer-managed conditions. The harvest indices (HI), ranging from 0.08-0.15 on dry matter (DM) basis, were relatively low and unaffected (P{\ensuremath{>}}0.05) by the environmental variation. The N harvest index (NHI) was 0.28 and P harvest index (PHI) was 0.19. The better responses of ICEAP00040 to favourable conditions could however only be realised in a minority of cases as yields generally were low. These low yields are still a major challenge in African smallholder agriculture as pulses play an important role in soil fertility maintenance as well as in the household diets.},

        abstract = {Nitrogen (N) transfer from one species to another is important for the N cycling in low-input grassland. The accuracy of measurements based on indirect dilution of soil 15N has been questioned. In the present work, estimates obtained by this technique were compared with estimates obtained by a direct 15N leaf feeding technique over two complete growing seasons in red clover-ryegrass and white clover-ryegrass mixtures under field conditions. 
	The direct technique documented that N transfer between clovers and ryegrass is a bi-directional process. The transfer of N from both clovers to ryegrass occurred within 25 days upon the first labelling event. A very high N transfer occurred from white clover to the associated ryegrass, 4.5 and 7.5 g m-2 in the 1st and 2nd production year, respectively. The corresponding values for transfer from red clover to the associated ryegrass were 1.7 and 3.6 g m-2. Quantified relatively to the total above-ground N content of white clover- ryegrass and red clover-ryegrass mixtures, the N transfer exceeded 50\% and 10\%, respectively, in three out of seven harvests. The N transfer from 15N labelled grass to associated clovers constituted a relatively constant proportion of approx. 8\% of the above-ground N content of the mixtures. 
	Estimates based on the soil 15N dilution technique generally underestimated the net N transfer by more than 50\% compared to the direct 15N labelling technique. Furthermore, the indirect 15N dilution technique estimated only marginal differences between red and white clover in the quantities of N transferred, whereas the direct 15N labelling technique showed the N transfer from white clover to the associated ryegrass to be significantly higher than that involving red clover. It is concluded that N transfer is a much more dynamic and quantitatively important process in grassland than previously recognised.

The challenge addressed in this chapter is to find appropriate ways to supplement these carbohydrates. Using Phaseolus beans as example, we discuss the focus of our efforts based on variations in yield of the crop and variations in the bean grain?s richness in minerals. Securing an abundant supply of minerals in the daily diet of people is a major challenge for mankind. But acknowledging that farmers cultivate their crops in very different environments may be a first important premise to re-establish the bridge between agriculture and human well-being. If the farmers are helped to address the localness, the food industry may benefit from such a premise as the supply of raw materials can be increased. When resources become even more scares in the very near future and climate change contribute to variability, such possibilities for resource use optimization will become an important agenda. A prototyping research approach at farmers? level is advocated where particular value chains are described. Prototyping are particularly important when addressing localness.}

Among the six indicators or aspects of empowerment the mean participation in decision making of the respondents was the highest (19.46) and access to service providers was the lowest (10.11). The findings also revealed that the mean of contribution to household agriculture activity was 18.25, access to resources was 15.48 and access to information was 14.32. In the study area, majority of the respondent women were middle aged category, illiterate, medium family size, small farm size, medium family income, medium agricultural knowledge, short training experience, medium socio-economic status, medium attitude and very slight fatalistic category.  },

To date, little is known about Syrian farmers? attitudes towards organic fruit and vegetable production. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the intentions and attitudes of Syrian farmers of FFV towards organic farming and the likelihood of converting their farms to organic production within the next five years. The study was based on a survey among 266 Syrian farmers. The theory of planned behaviour (TPB) was used as theoretical framework and partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) as the main tool for data analysis. The results show that the majority of farmers currently use at least one of the practices, which are also part of certified organic production, and hold strong positive attitudes and intentions to adopt organic production within the next five years.}

Additionally, a number of marketing initiatives in France, Austria, Great Britain and Switzerland were analysed to examine their applicability to German conditions.
Within the framework of the International Farm Comparison Network, eleven case studies of organic beef farms in the countries considered were analysed. The strength of the German farms lies on the return side, which is dominated by direct payments. Germany and Austria produce at the highest cost, and profitability in Germany is relatively low. Competitive pressure from France and Austria can not be expected as long as product price levels are higher than in Germany. On the other hand, export opportunities for Germany are limited due to the preference for beef of national / regional origin.
There appears to be an incentive for conversion to organic farming on marginal grassland locations in the Czech Republic. On the other hand, future cost increases can be expected. Price differences between domestic and potential export markets will determine the extent of expansion of organic beef production. Argentina, the lowest cost producer, shows major similarities between organic and conventional beef production. However, its potential for further expansion appears to be limited by the local competition with crop production, the use of GMO-seed, and limited potential for expanding production to locations outside the Humid Pampa.
The analysis of marketing initiatives shows, however, that the most pressing need for action lies on the marketing side and among the actors themselves. Improved product quality, price premiums, differentiation of marketing channels, and improved communication (towards consumers and in the supply chain) are key words. As the elbow room for price increases appears to be rather limited in the foreseeable future, cost reductions remain a strategy for the producers, for example through specialisation, growth, productivity improvements and reduction of labour costs.},

This report is the last of a series1 of four on organic farm incomes from 2001/02 through to 2004/05 as part of project OF0189.
The main aim of this work is to assess the financial performance of organic farms differentiated by farm type, in order to inform DEFRA policy-making with respect to economics of organic farming, and to provide a basis for assessments by farmers, advisers and other interested parties of the farm-level implications of conversion to and continued
organic farming. This research area builds on previous economics work on organic farming carried out by Institute of Rural Sciences, UWA (Project OF0190, covering 1995/96 to 1998/99).
In this report, time series financial data are shown for an identical farm sample for the
2003/04 and 2004/05 financial years, covering seven organic farm types including cropping, horticulture, lowland and LFA dairy, lowland and LFA cattle and sheep and mixed farming systems. The identical farm samples comprise farms that are present in both 2003/04 and 2004/05. The total number of organic farms for 2004/05, also referred to as the full farm sample data, is shown alongside the identical datasets.
Summarised and detailed financial input, output, income, returns to labour and capital, liabilities and assets and some physical performance measures are presented based on current Farm Business Survey (FBS) data collection and collation guidelines. The full samples of organic farms per robust farm type are sufficiently large to give some reasonable level of confidence in the data; however, it should be noted that the organic farm samples are not statistically representative of their type, although the results can be seen as a reasonable indication of farm income levels for comparable organic and conventional farms. Smaller identical farm samples should be treated more cautiously as there is a possibility for outliers (especially larger farms) to have some influence on the average results. 
An additional element of this work is the inclusion of comparable conventional farm data for the farm types shown. Each organic farm within this study was matched with an appropriate cluster of conventional farms based on the resource endowment indicators for
individual organic farms. Broadly speaking, the indicators included farm type, FBS region,
Less Favoured Area (LFA) status, utilisable agricultural area (UAA), milk quota holding (where applicable) and farm business size. The cluster farm data were averaged for each farm type to derive the comparable conventional farm (CCF) data based on the organic farms from the identical and full farm samples.
Overall, the identical sample of organic farms showed a similar or higher level of net farm income for all farm types in 2004/05 than in 2003/04 with the exception of lowland dairy farms, which decreased over the period. On comparing the organic data with the comparable conventional data, the greatest differences in performance were seen in the cropping, lowland cattle and sheep and mixed farm types where organic farms performed significantly better in 2004/05. LFA cattle and sheep farm types performed similarly to the comparable conventional farm samples while LFA organic dairy farms achieved lower net farm incomes than the conventional comparison farms. The full sample datasets compared similarly to the identical datasets for both organic and conventional farms in 2004/05.
Gross margin data are presented for organic dairy herds on a herd size and top five performing herd basis. Cattle and sheep gross margins are shown for lowland and LFA farm types. Crops shown include winter and spring wheat, spring barley, winter and spring oats, beans, ware potatoes, calabrese, cauliflower and cabbage crops. Where applicable, 2003/04 gross margin data are shown alongside the 2004/05 data.
Benchmarking data are shown for organic milk, suckler store, finishing beef and lamb production enterprises. The results for the beef and lamb enterprises show the significance of support payments in making these enterprises viable, raising questions about the possible impact of the single farm payment on producer perceptions of their profitability.}

Crop diversification in the agroecosystem can potentially increase biodiversity of arthropods, and microorganisms above- and belowground, improve crop yields, and reduce pest and pathogen attacks. We here present a project that investigates the potential benefits of strip cropping under Danish conditions, by 1) design and implementation of optimal strip cropping fields, 2) functional and biological diversity of arthropods, with focus on pests and predators, 3) microbial diversity and pathogen damage, 4) agronomical aspects, such as crop rotation, tillage, weed control, and yield effects, and 5) development of practical implementation, and sustainability analyses. The strip crop fields were established in 2021, in rows with two levels of crop diversity: 3 m rows with wheat, sugar beet, barley, faba bean, rye, oat, pea, and quinoa, and 6 m rows with wheat, sugar beet, barley, and faba bean, in a block design of four repetitions. The arthropod assessments, with focus on arthropod diversity and aphid infestations in faba bean and barley, were conducted by visual observations and the use of trap methods (pitfall traps and pantraps). Preliminary data indicate an effect of row width, by a lower aphid infestation and an earlier presence of predators in 3 m strips compared to 6 m strips. This project contributes with practical as well as scientific knowledge for implementation of strip cropping to support biodiversity and agroecosystem resilience.},

        abstract = {Production of organic growing pigs is characterized by indoor housing with access to outdoor concrete yards and feeding high amounts of supplementary feed based on grain and imported protein feed. However, this is not in accordence with the organic principles, which insist on optimization of nutrient recirculation, use of local renewable resources and animals being able to perform normal behaviour.
The overall aim of the project was to contribute to development of an eco-efficent and trustworthy organic production system based on free-range growing pigs in pasture systems. The point of departure was to integrate the unique innate ability of pigs to forage above and below ground as a resource in the farming system. It was hypothesised that foraging in the range area could pose an important contribution to nutrient supply of growing pigs.
Foraging activity, nutrient intake from the range area and pig performance were investigated in 36 growing pigs foraging on alfalfa or grass and fed either a standard organic feed mixture (HP: high protein) or a grain mixture with 52\% of crude protein recommendations (LP: low protein) from an average live weight of 58 kg to 90 kg in three replicates. Pigs were fed 80\% of energy recommendations and had access to a total of 154 m2 pig-1 during the 40-days experimental period from September to October 2013.
Rooting activity was significantly affected by feed and forage crop interactions but the effect of protein level was more pronounced in grass paddocks with LP pigs rooting 44\% of all observations and HP pigs 19\% compared to 28 vs. 16\% for pigs foraging on alfalfa. Protein level did not have a significant effect on grazing activity but pigs on alfalfa grazed significantly more than pigs on grass (10 vs. 4\% of all observations).
Based on crop samples alfalfa intake tended to be significantly affected by protein level with a daily dry matter intake in LP and HP pigs of 470 and 330 g pig-1, corresponding to an energy intake of 0.35 vs. 0.32 Danish Feed Units. Alfalfa crude protein and lysine intake was higher in LP pigs compared to HP pigs but the difference was not significant. Compared to grass paddocks available earthworm crude protein was higher in alfalfa paddocks (84 vs. 55 g pig-1 day-1) indicating the potential of contributing to protein requirements of organic growing pigs.
Daily weight gain and feed conversion ratio were significantly affected by feed and forage crop interactions. LP treated pigs had 33\% lower daily weight gain compared to HP pigs (589 vs. 878 g) and 31\% poorer feed conversion ratio (3.75 vs. 2.59 kg feed kg-1 weight gain) in grass paddocks, whereas in alfalfa paddocks LP pigs only had 18\% lower daily weight gain compared to HP pigs (741 vs. 900 g) and 14\% lower feed conversion ratio (2.95 vs. 2.54 kg feed kg-1 weight gain). LP pigs foraging on alfalfa used 169 g less feed crude protein compared to HP pigs, whereas in grass paddocks it was 109 g less, indicating the nitrogen efficiency of the systems.
Regarding development of eco-efficient forage based system for organic growing pigs, further investigations are needed, in particular on suitable forage crops, energy requirements for activity and social interactions and effect of group size on foraging behaviour.}

        abstract = {Recent conversations concerning organic food systems have focused on the conventionalization hypothesis, which posits that the organic food sector has become increasingly bifurcated between ??historical?? players in the organic movement on one side, and on the other by distributors and industrial operators recently arrived in the sector, who practice a more conventionalized form of organic agriculture which is now on the ascendancy. The most prominent explanations for the growth and dominance of a conventionalized organic food system have be eneconomic, based in the logics of input costs, especially land rent. We use the cases of the Belgian Blue commodity system and the Belgian organic beef commodity system to argue that conventionalization is also cognitive. To understand the role of cognition in the ascendance of the conventional organic food sector, we utilize concept of ??re?fe?rentiel??{--}or systemof cognitive references as developed by Muller and Jobert. We believe that comparing organic and conventional practices as two systems of cognitivereferences makes a deeper understanding of conventionalization possible in two ways: first because it makes it clear that the two systems coexist on a cognitive level, understood in a broad sense as tightly knit sets of knowledges, beliefs, standards, and images. Secondly, the concept of re?fe?rentiel enables one to understand how the conventional system can become irreversible (lock-in effect) and thus incompatible with the development of the organic system.},

Four parasitoid species were recorded, of which Diaretiella rapae was the most common. It provided 21.32\% of parasitism on Brevicoryne brassicae. In the non-cultivated habitat, 36 plant species hosted 22 aphid species and five parasitoid species. The aphid Myzus persicae was present on 17 plant species of eight different families. Macrosiphoniella artemisiae was the most abundant aphid species, with the associated Aphidius sp. being the most abundant parasitoid. Aphidius polygonaphis provided 10\% of parasitism on Uroleucon aeneus.

Impacts for conventional and organic farming are analysed in a partial equilibrium model of the Danish farm sector, which enables assessment of distributional effects between different farm types. The analysis suggests that crop production value and feed costs will increase, leading to a net economic loss in the conventional sector and a small gain for organic farming. Some variation across farm types in terms of adoption of biomass production and economic outcomes were found.}

        abstract = {Habitat fragmentation, the process by which relatively  continuous habitats is broken into smaller pieces, occurs in natural systems but is to a high degree also human-induced through landscape use. Fragmentation of the landscape produces a series of habitat patches surrounded by a matrix of different habitats and land use regimes. The major landscape consequences of fragmentation are loss of habitat, reduction in habitat patch size, and increasing isolation of habitat patches. In general, population performance declines in response to habitat loss but size of remaining area and isolation effects is known also to influence the population trend. Small mammals are well suited for examination of population responses to habitat 
fragmentation as they have modest spatial requirements and  short generation times.

In theory, organic farms could play an important role in the agricultural landscape as refuges for some small 
mammal species, as the lack of pesticide and fertiliser treatment, less weed control, more diversified crop structure and a general environmental friendly attitude, form a basis for habitats that provide cover and food 
for small mammals, and thus for larger predators of these species. Furthermore, density and area of small biotopes could be expected to be higher in the organic farms, thus leading to a decreased distance between optimal habitats.

This study compares species diversity and abundance of small mammals in conventional farms and intensively and extensively grown organic farms. In a wide range of different fields in conventional and organic farms, the diversity and density of small mammals were investigated by live-trapping sessions, comprising trap lines with 15 meters between each trap. We studied the responses of populations (belonging to 11 species of small mammals) to habitat patches of different size and different surrounding management strategies (ecological and conventional farming). We found a general correlation between the number of small mammal individuals and small biotope size.

This correlation applies in autumn as well as in spring. There is only a weak tendency for more small mammals in small biotopes within organic farms compared within conventional farms. The number of small mammal species stabilises at small biotope sizes around 1000 square meters. The value of organic farms in respect to small mammal biodiversity depends mainly upon the number and area of small biotopes, and only to a minor degree upon the treatments of the fields. }

        abstract = {North European landscapes are highly dominated by agriculture, where small biotopes, e.g. meadows, uncultivated grassland, hedge rows, field boundaries, surroundings of water ponds, only comprise a low percentage. In recent years organic farming has expanded in acreage due to customers increased awareness regarding pesticide and fertilizer use and biodiversity conservation. However, organic farming has changed from an extensive production with small fields, low mechanical impact and high crop diversity towards larger fields, intensive mechanical treatment, lower weed densities and lower field diversity. Still, organic farms could play an important, role in the agricultural landscape as refuges for some small mammal species.

We studied the responses of populations to habitat patches of different size and different surrounding management strategies (ecological and conventional farming). Studies were performed at two localities in Denmark, Kal{\o} Estate in Eastern Jutland and the Bjerringbro area in Central Jutland. The sampling sites were represented by cultivated grassland habitat, small biotopes within cultivated fields and hedgerows between fields in rotation.

Small mammal species assemblages were low in numbers in cultural farmland, and, on a property basis, not significantly different between organic and conventional farms. Very few species and individuals were present in the field matrix, and the small biotopes were by far the most important source of species richness. Species density was positively correlated with the size of the habitat, and, generally, more voles were found in organic habitat patches than in conventional ones. More field voles were found in organic grassland and more bank voles (Myodes glareolus) in organic hedge rows than in conventional ones. Telemetry studies of field voles showed low rates of dispersal and low colonization rates of the more or less isolated small biotopes at the time of year with no vegetation cover in the surrounding fields. We found no significant correlations between distance to nearest stepping stones/dispersal corridors and small mammal densities or species composition. In agricultural areas landscape structure influences the small mammal species living in this fragmented habitat matrix. The value of organic farms in respect to small mammal biodiversity depends mainly upon the number and area of small biotopes, and only to a minor degree upon the management of the fields. This is presumably related to a more dense and diverse vegetation cover, due to a lack of pesticide and fertilizer treatment in the organically managed small biotopes.

The aim of the study was to 
quantify home ranges and movements of voles in order to test a hypothesis that vole populations living in organic farm could colonize unoccupied areas in conventional farms. Voles were radiocollared and tracked until death or disappearance. Results showed that vole home-ranges were 
larger during onset of the breeding season than during the height of the breeding season and the non-breeding period. Males had larger home ranges than females. Voles occupying isolated small biotopes had restricted home range and only few individuals crossed fields from one small biotope to another. Although crossings do occur, the magnitude of dispersal seems restricted.},

However, other factors, such as the production type, farm size, geographical location and{--}not the least{--}the management of the farm, also influence the contribution. Using the ban on synthetic pesticides and restricted use of antibiotics, including the requirements to compensate for and prevent such uses in organic farming, as examples, the positive and negative contributions of organic farming in relation to selected public goods were analysed. The contributions of organic farming to Nature and Biodiversity and Human and Animal Health and Welfare are mainly positive compared to conventional farming for all farm types, whilst the effects on Environment and Energy and Climate are mixed; i.e. some effects are positive and others are negative. The analysis revealed a need for further documentation and revision of the organic principles and specific organic requirements{--} in particular in relation to the public goods Energy and Climate, which at present are not addressed in the EU Organic Regulation. Moreover, some organic farming requirements and practices cause dilemmas; e.g. more space per animal and outdoor access improves Animal Health and Welfare but at the same time has negative effects on Environment, Energy Consumption and Climate Change. These dilemmas should be solved before OA may be fully attractive as an integrated policy measure supporting jointly several public goods objectives.}

        abstract = {The demand for organic vegetables is increasing rapidly but cannot be met by current agronomic methods. Alternative methods, which enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services including pollination, are currently under development. In SureVeg (a Core Organic Co-fund funded project), we tested strip-cropping systems, i.e. a diversified cropping system in which alternating rows of different vegetable crops are sown. It is hypothesized that strip-cropping will provide floral resources during an extended period, supporting agroecosystem services provided by beneficial insects, including natural biological control and insect pollination. In the current study, we investigated a cropping system involving two insect pollinated crops: hokkaido pumpkin and faba beans, in addition to wild-flower strips. The study focused on pollination and fruit set of hokkaido pumpkin. The experimental set-up was established as an on-farm experiment hosted by an organic farm (Skiftek{\ae}r {\O}ko, Denmark), and included three fields: (1) hokkaido mono-culture (2) hokkaido mono-culture with flower strips and (3) strip cropped hokkaido pumpkin and faba bean and flower strips. In all fields, numbers of flowers and number and identity of flower-visiting insects were counted in transect walks carried out 2-3 times during the flowering season. Honeybees (Apis mellifera) were the main visitors, while bumblebees (Bombus spp) visited the flowers to a lesser extent. Pollinator abundances differed temporally and across different fields. Fruit weight was significantly higher in the strip cropped and flower strip hokkaido fields than the pure hokkaido field without flower strips. However, as the study did not include replicated fields, it cannot be concluded if other factors than cropping practice may have affected pollination and fruit set in hokkaido pumpkins. Furthermore, due to extreme drought in 2018, results may not reflect normal flowering and crop yield.}

Samtidig har interessen for ku-kalv kontakt-systemer, hvor ku og kalv f{\r a}r v{\ae}re sammen i en periode etter f{\o}dsel, {\o}kt. En nylig unders{\o}kelse blant borgere i USA og Canada kartla holdninger til ulike systemer for {\r a} holde ku og kalv. Respondentene var like negative til alle tre systemene som innebar tidlig separasjon (der kalvene ble holdt alene, i grupper med andre kalver eller med ammetanter) (Sirovica et al. 2022). Derimot var holdningene positive til systemet hvor kalven fikk v{\ae}re med sin egen mor. I det norske SUCCEED-prosjektet antydet fokusgruppeintervjuer at norske borgere har st{\o}rre tillit til b{\o}nder og landbruket i Norge enn borgere i andre land, noe som kan f{\o}re til h{\o}yere aksept for systemer med tidlig separasjon. Respondenter fra den norske dagligvarekjeden mente at det trolig ikke finnes et marked for meieriprodukter fra systemer med ku-kalv-kontakt i Norge, da kundene neppe er villige til {\r a} betale h{\o}yere priser (Kvam \& Logstein 2023). M{\r a}let med v{\r a}rt prosjekt var {\r a} unders{\o}ke nordmenn sin kjennskap til norsk melkeproduksjon, deres holdninger til ulike systemer for kalvehold f{\o}r og etter tilleggsinformasjon, samt deres villighet til {\r a} betale for melk fra systemer der kalven har v{\ae}rt sammen med sin egen mor. Dette ble gjort gjennom en sp{\o}rreunders{\o}kelse med 1 000 norske borgere, hvor vi ogs{\r a} samlet inn
bakgrunnsinformasjon om respondentene for {\r a} kunne analysere hvilke faktorer som eventuelt p{\r a}virket svarene deres. Flertallet av respondentene i unders{\o}kelsen oppga at de var ?ikke noe s{\ae}rlig? eller ?litt? kjent med norsk melkeproduksjon. N{\r a}r det gjaldt holdninger til ulike systemer for hold av ku og kalv, viste respondentene st{\o}rst negativitet til systemet ?kalv alene?, etterfulgt av ?kalv i gruppe?, deretter ?kalv med ammetante?, og mest positivitet til ?kalv med mor?. Etter {\r a} ha mottatt tilleggsinformasjon endret holdningene seg noe, men rekkef{\o}lgen p{\r a} hvilke systemer som ble vurdert mest negativt og mest positivt forble uendret. Tilleggsinformasjonen f{\o}rte til at respondentene ble noe mindre negativt til systemer som inneb{\ae}rer tidlig separasjon av ku og kalv, samtidig som de ble litt mindre positive til systemer der kalven f{\r a}r v{\ae}re med mor. Selv om forskjellene mellom systemene fortsatt var tydeligere, ble gapet mellom holdningene til tidlig separasjon og samv{\ae}r mellom kalv og mor mindre etter at informasjonen ble gitt. De fleste respondentene oppga at de var villige til {\r a} betale det samme for melk fra systemer der kalven f{\r a}r v{\ae}re med sin egen mor (CCC-melk) som for vanlig melk i dag. Litt over en fjerdedel svarte at de var villige til {\r a} betale mer for CCC-melk, noe som indikerer at det kan finnes et marked for denne typen meieriprodukter i Norge. Bakgrunnsvariabler hadde en betydelig effekt p{\r a} svarene, og s{\ae}rlig tydelig var forskjellen mellom menn og kvinner. Kvinner var generelt mer negative til systemer som inneb{\ae}rer tidlig separasjon av ku og kalv, mer positive til systemet ?kalv med mor? og hadde h{\o}yere betalingsvilje for CCC-melk. Resultatene fra studien tyder p{\r a} at {\o}kt informasjon kan bidra til at flere aksepterer praksiser som inneb{\ae}rer tidlig separasjon av ku og kalv. Likevel er det fortsatt flest som foretrekker systemet der kalven f{\r a}r v{\ae}re med sin egen mor.}

finansiert av dyrevernfondet og prosjektet ?SUCCEED ? Funksjonelle l{\o}sninger for kontakt mellom melkeku og kalv? (2020-2023) finansiert av Forskningsmidlene for jordbruk og matindustri (FFL/JA), NFR prosjektnummer 310728.

Vinteren 2020-2021 intervjuet NORS{\O}K og Ruralis 13 melkeprodusenter med ku og kalv sammen. For denne rapporten har vi valgt ut 10 av disse intervjuene hvor vi har skrevet om de 10 og hvordan de gj{\o}r det med ku og kalv sammen p{\r a} sine g{\r a}rder, med bilder. Deretter kommer en oppsummering av hva melkeprodusentene ser som fordeler og utfordringer med {\r a} ha ku og kalv sammen. I forbindelse med SUCCEED-prosjektet og PhD-studiet hadde vi ogs{\r a} et fors{\o}k med kyr og kalver p{\r a} beite sommeren 2021, og i slutten av resultatene i denne rapporten har vi skrevet litt om fors{\o}ket og et intervju med g{\r a}rdbrukerne vi hadde fors{\o}ket hos. 

I diskusjonen sammenligner vi resultater fra v{\r a}re intervjuer med tidligere studier p{\r a} ku og kalv, blant annet nyere studier med intervjuer av b{\o}nder i flere ulike europeiske land og et med intervjuer av b{\o}nder fra New Zealand. Deretter har vi skrevet om v{\r a}re perspektiver rundt hvordan 
det kan tilrettelegges for {\r a} ha ku og kalv lenger sammen i melkeproduksjon n{\r a}r det gjelder hva som er best for kalven, hva som er best for kua, hva som er best for bonden og hvordan en kan etablere et driftssystem som kan fungere for alle parter. 

Fra kua og kalvens perspektiv viser det overveiende materialet fra litteraturgjennomgang og intervjuer at det er fordeler for begge med en lengst mulig dieperiode og en gradvis separasjon. Fra bondens perspektiv er det b{\r a}de fordeler og ulemper. Det avgj{\o}rende er hvordan det praktisk kan tilrettelegges i fj{\o}set og p{\r a} beitet for b{\r a}de dyr og r{\o}kter, og der {\o}konomien ogs{\r a} spiller en viktig rolle. {\O}konomi handler f{\o}rst og fremst om reduserte inntekter fra levert melk n{\r a}r kalven dier mora, og det kan handle om investeringskostnader for {\r a} tilrettelegge i fj{\o}set og p{\r a} beite for {\r a} ha ku og kalv sammen. 

Generelt er det fortsatt behov for mer kunnskap og praktisk r{\r a}dgivning for b{\r a}de fj{\o}sl{\o}sninger, metoder for separasjon og annen kunnskap om kort- og langtidseffekter for dyr og bonde i slike driftsopplegg. Dette belyses i p{\r a}g{\r a}ende forskningsprosjekt (bl.a. SUCCEED), og det vil fortl{\o}pende bli publisert artikler med ny kunnskap de n{\ae}rmeste par {\r a}rene, som vil v{\ae}re med og bygge opp et bedre kunnskapsgrunnlag.}

        abstract = {I konvensjonell melkeproduksjon er det ingen krav om at ku og kalv skal v{\ae}re sammen, og tradisjonelt blir ku og kalv separert umiddelbart eller kort tid etter f{\o}dsel. I {\o}kologisk melkeproduksjon skal kalven die kua i minst tre dager, og den skal ha naturlig melk i minst tre m{\r a}neder. Forbrukerne er stadig mer opptatt av dyrevelferd, og det er et {\o}kende fokus p{\r a} det {\r a} ha ku og kalv sammen lenger i melkeproduksjon. Det er mange fordeler med {\r a} ha ku og kalv sammen lenger, men det er ogs{\r a} utfordringer. En av utfordringene er at dyra kan vise en sterkere stressrespons etter separasjon sammenlignet med om man separerer de raskt etter f{\o}dsel. Det finnes ulike metoder for br{\r a} og trinnvis separasjon av ku og kalv, og forskning viser at noen metoder kan gi mindre stressreaksjon enn andre. 

Form{\r a}let med v{\r a}rt fors{\o}k p{\r a} Tingvoll gard var {\r a} sammenligne stressrelatert atferd hos kyr og kalver ved to ulike separasjonsmetoder etter en forlenget periode p{\r a} tre til fem uker sammen i en kalvingsbinge. Metode 1: Br{\r a} separasjon hvor kalvene ble flyttet til et annet fj{\o}s 300 meter unna, og metode 2: Totrinns-separasjon med fenceline hvor kalvene ble flyttet til en binge inne i kyrnes l{\o}sdrift hvor de fikk v{\ae}re i fire dager f{\o}r de ble flyttet til en annen del av fj{\o}set. Atferden til kyrne og kalvene ved dag 1, 2 og 3 etter separasjonsdagen (dag 0) ble registrert ved kontinuerlige observasjoner og {\o}yeblikksobservasjoner. 

Resultatene fra fors{\o}ket viste forskjeller i atferd hos ku og kalv ved de ulike dagene etter separasjon ved at b{\r a}de kyrne og kalvene vokaliserte signifikant mer ved dag 1 sammenlignet med dag 2 og 3. Kyrne l{\r a} signifikant mindre p{\r a} dag 1 sammenlignet med dag 3, bevegede seg signifikant mer ved dag 1 sammenlignet med dag 2 og 3, og de brukte signifikant mindre tid p{\r a} {\r a} spise/drikke ved dag 1 og 2 sammenlignet med dag 3. Det var ingen signifikant forskjell for atferden ?st{\r a}r? (tre atferder samlet) hos kyrne, men for ?st{\r a}r, {\r a}rv{\r a}ken? var det signifikant mer av atferden p{\r a} dag 1 og 2 sammenlignet med dag 3. Den eneste atferden hos kyrne som ga signifikant forskjell for metode var ?spiser kraftf{\^o}r? hvor kyr ved metode 1 brukte mer tid p{\r a} {\r a} spise kraftf{\^o}r sammenlignet med kyr ved metode 2, men her var det f{\r a} registreringer. Kalvene brukte det meste av tiden sin p{\r a} {\r a} ligge, men resultatene viste at de bevegde seg signifikant mer ved dag 2 sammenlignet med dag 3, og at kalver ved metode 1 brukte signifikant mer tid p{\r a} {\r a} spise/drikke sammenlignet med kalver ved metode 2, men her var det ogs{\r a} f{\r a} registreringer. 

Resultatene fra fors{\o}ket v{\r a}rt viste forskjeller som tyder p{\r a} at kyrne og kalvene var mer stresset ved dag 1 etter separasjon sammenlignet med dag 2 og 3, men for de to ulike separasjonsmetodene fikk vi ingen tydelige forskjeller som tydet p{\r a} at dyra var mer stresset ved den ene metoden sammenlignet med den andre.},

        abstract = {NORS{\O}K fikk i oppdrag fra Regelverksutvalget for {\o}kologisk landbruk {\r a} unders{\o}ke om det er forhold i {\o}kologiske driftssystemer for slaktekyllingproduksjon som kan bidra til {\r a} redusere risikoen for sykdom med p{\r a}f{\o}lgende antibiotikabehandling, og samtidig im{\o}tekomme krav om {\o}kt andel egenprodusert f{\^o}r og utfasing av konvensjonelle proteinf{\^o}rmidler. I Norge er det liten {\o}kologisk fj{\o}rfeproduksjon, men fj{\o}rfe er husdyret som har st{\o}rst forskjell i dyrevelferd n{\r a}r man sammenligner {\o}kologisk og konvensjonell produksjon. NORS{\O}K har vurdert velferd hos produsenter med {\o}kologisk slaktekylling, intervjuet produsenter, sendt ut sp{\o}rreskjema til andre akt{\o}rer og gjennomf{\o}rt litteraturstudie. Saktevoksende raser, milj{\o}berikelser, lav dyretetthet og tilgang til et attraktivt uteomr{\r a}de er veldig positivt for kyllingers velferd. Det {\r a} ha hjemmeklekking, det {\r a} bruke kunstige kyllingm{\o}dre, samt ha enda mer attraktive uteomr{\r a}der vil antagelig kunne gi enda bedre velferd for {\o}kologiske kyllinger. Det kan dukke opp sykdom som m{\r a} behandles med antibiotika ogs{\r a} i {\o}kologisk slaktekyllingproduksjon, men forbruket av medikamenter er sv{\ae}rt lavt. Et krav om {\o}kt andel egenprodusert f{\^o}r til fj{\o}rfe vil kunne bli utfordrende {\r a} tilfredsstille fordi vi i Norge har lite {\o}kologisk kornareal, og avlingene kan variere mye p{\r a} grunn av blant annet klima. Ved d{\r a}rlige avlinger her kan det gjerne ogs{\r a} v{\ae}re d{\r a}rlige avlinger i n{\ae}rliggende omr{\r a}der i Norges naboland. F{\o}r et eventuelt krav om {\o}kt andel egenprodusert f{\^o}r i {\o}kologisk fj{\o}rfeproduksjon kommer, b{\o}r det v{\ae}re mer {\o}kologisk kornareal. Kravet til {\o}kt andel egenprodusert f{\^o}r til dr{\o}vtyggere kan komme f{\o}rst da det er lettere {\r a} tilfredsstille. Ang{\r a}ende utfasing av konvensjonelle proteinf{\^o}rmidler slik situasjonen er i dag vil det bli sv{\ae}rt vanskelig {\r a} optimere et ern{\ae}ringsmessig godt nok kraftf{\^o}r for {\o}kologiske fj{\o}rfes velferd og produksjon om man ikke kan fortsette med {\r a} bruke 5 \% konvensjonelle proteinr{\r a}varer i kraftf{\^o}ret. F{\o}r et eventuelt krav om 100 \% {\o}kologiske proteinr{\r a}varer i {\o}kologisk kraftf{\^o}r til fj{\o}rfe kommer m{\r a} en vite at det finnes et godt nok alternativ(er) til den andelen p{\r a} 5 \% som i dag er konvensjonelle r{\r a}varer. Et alternativ kan v{\ae}re {\r a} tillate aminosyren metionin som syntetisk i f{\^o}r til fj{\o}rfe, eventuelt {\r a} etter hvert bruke proteinr{\r a}varer som ikke krever kornareal.},

Fourteen heifers kept in two pens were housed on straw or wood chip bedding for 43 days, after which the bedding material was switched for 43 additional days. Significantly more mould was found in wood chip than in straw and there was a tendency towards less yeast in wood chip. The heifers had a low faecal parasitic load. The results indicate that the wood chip treatment resulted in somewhat cleaner animals. The heifers had a significantly longer total lying time when kept on straw. In conclusion, wood chip deep bedding could be an option as bedding material, but the impact on hygiene of bedding material and lying behaviour needs to be further investigated.},

        abstract = {In few years Danish organic protein crops may be used as ingredients in feed for organic fish in partial replacement of fish meal protein. Fish meal is currently the primary protein source in feed for organic fish. Fish meal is manufactured by industrial fish caught among sustainable stocks, but even natural this protein source is not defined as organic and is as well a limited resource. 

Therefore, it is necessary to replace as much as possible of the fish meal protein with competitive organic vegetable protein sources with high protein content as well as a relevant amino acid composition compared to that in fish meal. Opposite optimization of conventional fish feed the regulation does not allow addition of artificial amino acids to feed for organic fish.

It was found that farmers across the countries were positive about taking additional preventative measures to improve the health status of their herds. They believed this would not only improve herd physical performance, such as milk yield and fertility, but also achieve greater cost effectiveness and improved job satisfaction for them. Most study farmers would implement a tailored package of improvement measures designed by the study team with higher uptake most likely being by younger farmers, those who make greater use of veterinarians and professional advisory services, and those supplying specialist milk-marketing chains. Furthermore, farmers will be most likely to take-up additional health promotion if compatible with their everyday activities and if they have strong business performance goals aimed at maximising the physical performance of the herd.},

An Integrated Decision Support System (IDSS) is developed which synthesises current understanding of organic farming by means of a multiple objective framework incorporating GIS, biophysical models and socio-economic models of the farming goals. The IDSS uses a multitiered concept of a farming system as a collection of micro-enterprises at the field level, with individual resource endowments, objectives and activities. Farm-level decision drivers trickle down to affect the micro-level field enterprise selection. Biophysical models describe typical forage, cereal, root and legume output and a user-friendly interfaces permits easy access and output display via a GIS. A prototype of the IDSS framework, being developed as a part of the SAC organic research programme is presented.},

We aimed to characterise the primary sector of the goat milk production chain settled at those regions. Therefore, questionnaires were applied in order to depict profiles of the shepherds, their families, the role of the wife in the activity, the resources available, dependence on income generated by the activity, and how producers administrate their business. Farms were distributed in five strata according to the following daily milk production averages and standard deviations: 8.8 {$\pm$} 0.9, 15.7 {$\pm$} 3.9, 22.6 {$\pm$} 2.7, 34.4 {$\pm$} 3.4, and 183.8 {$\pm$} 54.2 L/d. Approximately 42\% of the interviewed producers conducted their activities according to a household production model and the income earned was exclusively from the dairy goat husbandry. Sons and daughters performed an important role in the business (27.80\%), but most of them (62.73\%) worked out at non farm activities. The percentage of wives that worked directly in the activity (@47\%) indicated that it could contribute to gender equity in the rural environment. Most of the production systems (63.16\%) presented positive gross margins. We have noticed, however, that shepherds perceived only the business gross margin and that the most accurate registries taken were those related to revenues. In general, producers of the higher strata were favoured by their larger production scale, but asymptotic behaviours for costs and amounts invested in animals, equipments and buildings were observed. These characteristics should be considered when policies related to the dairy goat primary sector have to be planned.},

        abstract = {Environmental as well as cultivation factors may greatly  influence the chemical composition of plants. The main factors affecting chemical composition of foodstuff is level and type of fertilizer (conventional and organic cultivation systems), location or soiltype and year of harvest. Organic foods are defined as products which are produced under controlled cultivation conditions characterized by the absence of synthetic fertilizers and  very restricted use of pesticides. 
Dietary carbohydrates constitute a major fraction of most feedstuffs and can be divided according to glycosidic linkage into sugars (mono- and disaccharides), oligosaccharides, starch and non-starch polysaccharides (NSP). The bulk of disaccharides and starch will be broken  down by the action of pancreatic and mucosal enzymes in the small intestine, while there are no enzymes capable of cleaving some types of oligosaccharides and NSP. A fraction of starch (resistant starch) may also pass the small intestine undegraded either because the starch is physically inaccessible, the starch has a structure that resist amylolysis or the starch is retrograded after heat treatment. Lignin is not a carbohydrate but is tightly associated to cell wall polysaccharides. The term dietary fibre (DF) is used for cell wall and storage NSP and lignin. Adequate intake of dietary fibre are generally accepted as linked to health benefit into a protective role in large bowel cancer, diabetes, coronary heart disease and the issue of faecal bulking.
Linoleic (C18:2 n-6) and {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-linolenic (C18:3 n-3) are essential fatty acids, which cannot be synthesized in the mammalian organism, and therefore must be supplied in the diet of animals and man. These fatty acids are precursors for the important longer chain higher polyunsaturated fatty acids of the n-6 and n-3 families. Although fats are essential part of the diet, but if consumed in excess, they may exert negative effects on human weight change. 
Potatoes, carrots, peas, green kale, apple, and rapeseed were grown by three different cultivation strategies, i.e. organic (ORG), conventional (CON), or semi-organic (ORG+) farming system. Each ingredient was treated as for application for human consumption: potatoes, mature, soaked peas and kale were boiled and raw carrots and apples were shredded, and the food was then freeze-dried and packed into airtight bags. Rapeseed oil was produced from the air-dried rapeseeds of the three cultivation treatments, and the residual was discarded. 
The carbohydrate fraction of the ingredients except rapeseed oil was analysed into: starch, sugars, oligosaccharides and all its constituents and lignin. Likewise the dietary lipids of all ingredients were extracted and the long-chain fatty acids determined by GLC. 
The ingredients were mixed with a standard synthetic mixture and were formulated to meet the NRC requirements for rats and used in a balance experiments for measuring the bioavalability of the ingredients. 
Carbohydrate and lignin were predominant dietary constituents with value from 584 g/kg DM in kale to 910 g/kg DM in potatoes. Triacylglycerol was the major lipid class in pea with 82 \% of total fatty acids in contrast to apple with only 35 \% of fatty acids of the ether extract.}

Crop yields were as high as in the treatment with ploughing after lay and chiselling after potatoes and sunflowers (B). Lowest yields were obtained without ploughing but using the chisel (G). Weeds, esp. grasses, resulted in a huge competition for crops esp. after lay. Profit margins were highest in B due to lower expenditures for tillage and lowest in G. Soil organic carbon amounts differed by 1,5 t/ha and earthworm biomass by 0,25 t/ha between P and G after 12 years. It can be summed up for this experiment that G was not sustainable due to weeds and declining yields, and that B resulted in best economic profit, increasing SOM content and seems to be a sustainable compromise. },

stakeholders and find out requirements for further developments and recommendations
for political actions on regional, national or European level. Methods of the discussions
and their analysis are reviewed and the outcomes are presented in a SWOT
analysis summarizing the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of social
farming. As a consequence of platform and analysis the ?Witzenhausen Position

Anion  and cation exchange HPLC were tailored to and applied for the separation of selenium species in proteolytic extracts  of the biological tissues using detection by ICP?MS or ESI?MS/MS. Foliar application of solutions of selenite or selenate at 100 lg Se ml?1 resulted in a selenium concentration of up to 2 lg Se g?1 (dry mass) in the carrot root whereas the selenium concentration in the  controls was below the limit of detection at 0.045 lg Se g?1 (dry mass). Selenate-enriched carrot leaves accumulated as much as 80 lg Se g?1 (dry mass), while the selenite-enriched leaves contained approximately 50 lg Se g?1 (dry mass). The speciation analyses showed that inorganic selenium was present in both roots and leaves. The predominant metabolised organic forms of selenium in the roots were selenomethionine and c-glutamyl-selenomethyl-
selenocysteine, regardless of which of the inorganic species were used for foliar application. Only selenomethionine was detected in the carrot leaves. The identity of selenomethionine contained in carrot roots and leaves was successfully confirmed by HPLC?ESI?MS/MS.},

         journal = {Ecology \& Society},
        abstract = {The market for organic foods is growing, the proportion of consumers buying organic foods is, nevertheless, still considered to be low. Relevant research continuously shows that one of the most significant barriers prohibiting consumers from purchasing (more) organic foods is lack of information. Both with regards to organic foods as such as well as to the additional qualities of organic foods compared to conventionally produced foods. This has led the relevant body of research to rally behind a generic call for better organic communication. The same body of research, however, seems to take for granted what makes communication good and that we all agree on what communication is. Within the context of this paper, these underlying assumptions will be challenged from both a theoretical and a practical perspective. With a point of departure in communication theory?s credo-like statement that any model of communication is also a model for communication, I will demonstrate that and how the communicative approach one favors, when communicating about organic foods, critically influences the consumer impact of any instance of organic communication. Applying the communication theoretical formats of transmission, interaction and co-action respectively unto instances of organic communication activities, I will discuss and evaluate to what extent each format encourages participation and learning on the side of the consumer. From these discussions stem several insights: Whereas transmission (typically in the form of monologuous mass communication) is the cost-effective format of choice in much organic communication, it is also a format which bars a sender (e.g., producer or farmer) from gauging deposits in the consumer (be it in the form of understanding the message or trusting the sender for that matter). The format of interaction (typically in the form of dialoguous encounters of different kinds) integrates feedback into communication, thereby allowing the sender to appreciate the level of understanding, trust etc. which the communicative effort has given rise to ? albeit at a higher price in terms of money, time and manpower. Last but not least, in the format of co-action (typically in the form of co-operative endeavors) the deposit is a matter of what is co-constructed by the participants ? be it understanding or trust or the like. Needless to say, this format satisfies the organic communicators craving for involving the consumer to a much larger degree than the other two formats could ever do; and due to the fact that food is generally seen as a low-involvement commodity, this is critical. But emancipating the consumer, so to speak, comes at a price. First of all, co-actional communication is crucially dependent on highly motivated participants and, secondly, co-actional communication is difficult if not impossible to control.    },

        abstract = {When thinking about animations, an intuitive reaction could be to dismiss them as mere children?s pastime, but that is by no means the whole picture. Animated films featuring highly specialized knowledge from, say, the domains of science, technology and engineering are to be found all over the current media landscape. There is a tendency that they are predominantly used in one specific communicative constellation, i.e., when domain-specific knowledge is communicated from an expert or authority to a lay person. That, too, is the case when it comes to the animated film ?MultiTrust? (to be found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmoXYJAS8LY ). This animation stems from the research project ?Multicriteria assessment and communication of effects of organic food systems? (http://multitrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Description-of-MultiTrust-from-Status-report-2011-to-Organic-RDD.pdf), which was conducted under the auspices of ICROFS (i.e., the International Centre for Research in Organic Food Systems, for more information please visit: http://www.icrofs.org/index.html). The color animation film was produced in 2013 by the award-wining Danish production company and animation studio Tumblehead Aps (for more information please visit: http://www.tumblehead.com/).

A primary intention of this multifaceted research project was to ?make it easier for consumers [?] to observe and evaluate the different contributions that organic food systems offer?, with a special emphasis ?to promote communication, participation and learning? about organic foods. One tangible result of this endeavor was the animated film aiming at presenting a novel way of communicating about multicriteria buyer decision-making with regards to organic food purchases. Whereas the film as such does not present a tool ready to be employed in the service of consumer communication, it does present a prototype for how we might design future communications about organic food products in a novel way.

The possibilities for growth in organic agriculture therefore depends on whether it, overall, makes a credible and attractive alternative, and whether the development of organics is positive with regard to organic principles and the key societal goals for environment, health and welfare. It is, however, extremely difficult to determine whether a specific technological, management or organizational development is positive or negative, overall. In other words, if we want to assess and evaluate organic food systems (or aspects thereof) it becomes evident that it is indeed not possible to base such an assessment solely on one criterion. We need multiple criteria; there are however, no established methods with which to conduct overall, multicriteria assessments or organic food systems.  },

At the same time organic plant products usually have been in general better evaluated in terms of taste and smell than conventional food. The aim of this study was to analyze the assortment of beetroot juice from organic and conventional stores in Warsaw, Poland and consumer sensory evaluation of selected products. Analysis of the products was carried out in grocery stores taking into account the size of usable floor space - large-and small area, and due to the specific origin of the range of products - organic and conventional food stores. The results showed that the market of beetroot juices were diverse - organic producers juices were available mainly in specialist organic stores, and conventional juices were available in all the analyzed places. Consumer sensory evaluation, which was conducted among the students, showed that consumers did not have a explicit preference for the taste, smell, color and consistency of beet juice, due to the origin of the product.},

Sows showed distinct preferences in the location of dunging and urination within the paddocks (p{\ensuremath{<}}0.001), but no differences between the paddocks. Vegetation cover under the sows was similar overall in the two paddock systems, but showed differences over the year.

        abstract = {From the beginning of 2018, inclusion of non-organic protein sources are not allowed in the diet of 100\% organic poultry in Europe. In this situation, a major nutritional challenge is to make sustainable supply of organic protein and amino acid in competitive price. This necessity triggers to search alternative protein sources for sustainable organic egg production. Clover grass protein concentrate (CPC) is dried protein concentrate prepared by pulping clover grass mixture mainly containing Red clover to obtain green juice followed by fermentation, centrifugation and drying. The crude protein, lysine and methionine content in CPC were determined to be 355.6, 20.3 and 6.3 g/kg dry matter respectively. This research was carried out to study the effect of graded level of clover grass protein concentrate in production performance, digestibility and egg quality of laying hens fed 100\% organic diet. Four diets (A, B, C, D) including CPC at level of 0 (control), 40, 80, and 120 g/kg (as fed) mainly at the expense of soya and soya cake were formulated to be iso-nitrogenous (CP=18.7\%) and iso-caloric (ME=10.5 MJ/kg) and fed to 240 Hisex hens for 12 weeks of experimental period in floor pen system in randomized block design (4 diets, 6 replicates, 10 birds/replicate) under environmental control system. Here, CPC contributed 0 (control diet), 7.4, 14.8 and 22.2\% of dietary crude protein. Data related to daily average feed intake, egg production, and egg quality measures, feed to egg ratio were collected. To study nutrient digestibility, a digestibility trial was conducted in battery cages employing a complete randomized design with same environment as in floor pen system. Every time, the excreta was collected in a bin and stored at -20 ?C to avoid possible microbial degradation. On the last day of the experiment, all eggs were collected to analyze egg quality. The egg shell quality was evaluated through shell fracture strength (N), fracture displacement (mm) at maximum force, fracture gradient (N/mm, elasticity), and the yolk quality through color. The present study showed that partial replacement of organic soybean and soya cake with organic clover grass protein concentrate does not influence negatively egg production parameters. The inclusion of 4, 8, and 12\% of CPC in the diets resulted similar feed intake (p=0.647), egg production (p=0.606), egg weight (p=0.11), egg mass per hen per day (p=0.815) and feed conversion ratio (0.436) in comparison to hens fed control diet. The egg productivity (\%) was 87.37 for diet without Clover protein concentrate and 89.01 for diet including 12\% of Clover protein concentrate and they were not statistically different. The digestibility experiment showed that for all four types of diets, total tract apparent digestibility of dry matter, and nitrogen retention were statistically similar. However, the coefficient of total tract apparent digestibility of methionine and lysine decreased significantly (p{\ensuremath{<}}0.001) with the increase of CPC from 4 to 12\% in diet. For all diets, egg shell strength and elasticity were comparable, however, the yolk color was significantly different. The lightness of yolk decreased while the redness increased significantly (p{\ensuremath{<}}0.0001) with the increase in CPC content in the diets. The yellowness was found significantly (p{\ensuremath{<}}0.0001) higher for diets with CPC but not among each other. The clover grass protein concentrate has positive effect on performance, digestibility and egg quality of laying hens fed 100\% organic diet and it can substantially substitute organic soybean or its product. It is concluded that clover grass protein concentrate is a promising protein source for organic laying hens to achieve optimum productivity and egg quality.},

        abstract = {Soil biological properties are the most sensitive soil quality indicators that respond quickly to short-term soil fertility management changes. We studied the combined effects of tillage and soil external inputs on total soil organic carbon and nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) and acid phosphomonoesterase activity (ACP). This was done in Meru South and Kandara sub-counties in Kenya for three consecutive cropping seasons. Tillage was the main factor [minimum (D0) and conventional (D15)], and soil external inputs were the sub-factors: sole mineral fertiliser (F), crop residues + mineral fertiliser (RF), crop residues + animal manure + legume intercrop Dolichos lablab L. (RML), crop residues + mineral fertiliser + animal manure (RFM), crop residues + Tithonia diversifolia + animal manure (RTiM), crop residues + Tithonia diversifolia + rock phosphate (RTiP) and an unfertilized treatment (Control). During the study period, we experienced frequent dry spells and meteorological droughts in the two sites. We found no significant effects of the tillage systems and mineral fertilisers applied alone or combined with crop residues on the biological properties. All additional organic inputs to the soils enhanced the biological soil properties. On average, MBC in the treatments with organic inputs only was enhanced by 51\% in Meru South and 19\% in Kandara. MBC-to-TOC ratio was significantly different (p = .0003) under soil external inputs in Meru South. On average, MBN in the treatments with organic inputs was enhanced by 66\% in Meru South and 25\% in Kandara. Compared with the control, ACP was higher under RML, RTiP and RTiM by 26\%, 20\% and 17\%, respectively in Meru South. In Kandara, ACP was higher under RTiM and RTiP by 25\% and 23\%, respectively, compared with the control. The increase in microbial biomass indicates that application of organic inputs contributed to soil organic C, thereby stimulating the microbial growth and enzyme activity. Thus, use of organic inputs or in combination with mineral fertilisers are feasible alternatives for sustaining soil organic carbon through increased microbial biomass leading to soil organic matter build-up, which is a vital element of soil quality and fertility.}

        abstract = {1. Background information
In order to examine the environmental and economic effect of low-input and organic types of agriculture in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, in 1995 EU-Phare programme funded a pilot project on setting up research and education demonstration centres for sustainable agriculture (EU/AR/301/91). The project?s objective was to ?test? the feasibility of sustainable types of agriculture under agro-ecological and socio-economic circumstances of the three countries concerned. The project also had to draft a policy paper for conversion to sustainable agriculture in these countries. Education and research on water quality, biodiversity, market potentials and macro-economic feasibility represented a substantial part of the project activities (ended up in May 1999). The results obtained and experienced gained by this project are used as the frame for a wider discussion regarding the impact of agricultural development scenarios on water resources in the Danube countries. 

2. Impact of agriculture on water resources in the Danube River Basin
Most agricultural operations, such as soil tillage, manuring, grazing, and irrigation, pose a serious threat to water quality. 
Agriculture is a substantial water user, and often the single biggest sector responsible for the pollution of European waters. In addition, agriculture threatens water habitats. Available data indicate that in many regions of Europe, agriculture alone is responsible for more than 50\% of the total nutrient load borne by water (Znaor, 1999; VROM, 1998; IFEN, 1998; OECD, 1997). Many surface and groundwater resources are exploited beyond sustainable levels and agriculture contributes to this problem by drawing off a considerable volume for irrigation purposes. 
Around 50\% of nitrate and phosphate pollution in the Danube River Basin are attributed to agriculture. The "Danube Integrated Environmental Study" (Haskoning, 1994), a research project involving approximately seventy experts from eleven Danube countries concluded that:
1.	Agriculture is the major source of pollution by nitrogen (50\%), phosphorus (53\%) and pesticides, and contributes significantly to metal (Cd, Cu, Zn), bacteria and viruses emissions
2.	Wetlands and related eco-systems still account for a substantial nutrient removal capacity with a high economic value
3.	 Environmental problems related to water pollution are amplified by the consumption patterns of the Danube basin population, particularly the increase of animal protein consumption 
4.	The damage to the priority functions (drinking water, recreation, fisheries, ecosystem) of ground and surface water in the Danube basin and part of the north-western shelf of the Black Sea is estimated to be about ?4 billion per year.
The findings of the Haskoning study were recently confirmed by another study (TG-MWRI, 1997). This study, too, found that more than 50\% of N and P in the surface water of the Danube basin derive from agriculture. A study from VITUKI (1997) concluded that a 25\% reduction of the nutrient loads (as compared to reference period 1989-91) is required to meet the environmental quality criteria for the Danube River, while a 40\% N-reduction and 50\% P-reduction scenario would be required for the Black Sea Basin. Experts from the CEE countries have suggested that such reductions (of about 50\%) would be feasible if so-called ?Best Agricultural Practices? could be generally applied. Obviously both Germany and Austria (Upper Danube) would have to contribute their share in this reduction as well.
The above data suggest that agriculture represents by far the most important sector for tacking nutrient pollution in the Danube basin. However, when calculating the amount of water pollution caused by agriculture, the pollution caused by agricultural practices are only part of the problem. Significant levels of pollution are caused by the agri-chemical industry that serves agriculture. It is a very substantial source of pollution. For instance: in Romania a single fertiliser producer contributes 13.4 \% to the total Romanian phosphate discharge (60,000 ton) into the Danube river (Toma, 1999).

3. Low-external input agriculture reality and water pollution 
In Central and Eastern Europe the sustainability issue in agriculture has two additional dimensions as compared to Western Europe. The ?transition?-process of economic and institutional reform, and the environmental ?opportunity? of current low-input reality in agriculture. Due to changes in the price of agricultural commodities and the high price of agricultural inputs, most of the farms in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) are forced to practice low-input farming. Input levels have fallen to 10-30\% of the input levels before 1989. In 1996-98, in most countries the agri-input levels have not increased above 10-50\% of the 1989 levels: Bulgaria 10\%, Yugoslavia 50\%, Poland 50\%, Romania 25\%, Russia 12\% (Kieft, 1999). 
Even though this is a rather 'forced' agro-social experiment, it is very interesting to study its impact on the agricultural production and water pollution in the Danube River Basin. The various data on inputs, outputs and water pollution show the potential to combine the objectives of agricultural production with environmental protection. Therefore this very reality of low input levels can be perceived also as an environmental opportunity for the region. Especially since a minimum 40-50\% nutrients reduction is required to enable ecologically sound functioning of the Black Sea (VITUKI, 1997). This opportunity is only interesting, however, if agricultural production can be increased without increasing pollution again.
Studies from some Danube countries (Kieft, 1999), as well as the results of the above-mentioned project indicate that by practising low-external input agriculture, the reduction of yields is not proportional to the reduction of fertiliser and pesticide inputs. Even with relatively low level of agri-chemical input farmers in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania can achieve interesting output levels, while at the same time reducing or avoiding environmental damages. Maintaining these output levels, however, requires improved farming practices including balanced nutrient management, improved manure handling, erosion control and crop rotations, based on low input techniques.

4. Further agricultural development scenarios and policy options
Within the framework of this project, a study measuring the macro-economic impact of sustainable agriculture in Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary was done too (Wit et al. 1999). It showed that large-scale conversion (up to 50\% of the arable land) to sustainable agriculture in these countries results in comparable national agricultural production value to that obtained by conventional scenario. The sustainable scenario exhibits even greater economic benefits when the external (environmental) costs accompanying agricultural production are internalised into the price of the produce. By charging a shadow price of ECU1 per kg of nitrogen leached, the sustainable scenario showed even greater economic benefit. It results in net national agricultural production value 16\% (Bulgaria), 49\% (Hungary) and 5\% (Romania) higher than by the conventional scenario. At the same time, the sustainable scenario reduced nitrogen leaching for 34\% (Bulgaria), 45\% (Hungary) and 35\% (Romania) when compared to the conventional scenario. This reduction complies with the targets set up for nutrient reduction for the Danube River and the Black Sea (VITUKI, 1997; Haskonig, 1994). 

5. Conclusion
Agriculture in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, although at a record low input, is not sustainable from an economic or environmental point of view unless it is accompanied by better management practices. A shift to improved low-input agriculture and organic agriculture is beneficial to the national economy and reduces number of environmental and water-related degradations. In order to make this shift possible- a 3-Track policy is proposed: (i) support to pioneering organic farming; (ii) improvement of low-input farming techniques; (iii) conversion of high-input agriculture to integrated agriculture. Establishment of an international facility to support national teams in preparing and implementing this policy would enable a concerted action not only for these three, but also for other Danube countries.

In study I, data was collected using semi-structured questionnaires and focus group discussions. Farmers allocated more land (P{\ensuremath{<}}0.05) to organic pineapple production compared with livestock. Tethering was the commonest cattle management system. Fifty three percent of respondents reported using both natural pastures and crop residues as major dairy cattle feed resources while only 19\% reported using elephant grass. Farmers reported high cost of concentrates and scarcity of feeds as their biggest challenges in dairy cattle production. Of the respondents, 51.4\% conserved feed for their cattle but only as elephant grass fodder banks. As a coping strategy to feed shortages, majority (42.9\%) of farmer scavenged for feed resources from both organic certified and nonorganic neighbouring farms which is contrary to organic livestock farming standards. In study II, wilting and increasing level of C. ensiformis foliage inclusion decreased (P{\ensuremath{<}}0.001) DM losses but increased (P{\ensuremath{<}}0.001) DM and CP content of silages. However, the effect of wilting on DM losses depended (P{\ensuremath{<}}0.05) on inclusion level of C. ensiformis foliage. Wilted silage had lower (P{\ensuremath{<}}0.05) ammonia nitrogen content compared with unwilted silages. In the unwilted silages, NH3-N content followed a quadratic trend (P{\ensuremath{<}}0.05) with increasing level of C. ensiformis inclusion. In both unwilted and wilted silages, lactic acid increased at a decreasing rate (P{\ensuremath{<}}0.01) with increasing levels of C. ensiformis inclusion. Metabolisable energy (ME), and net energy of lactation (NEL) increased at a decreasing rate (P{\ensuremath{<}}0.05) with increasing levels of C. ensiformis inclusion for the wilted silages. Maximum values for NEL in the wilted silages were at {\texttt{\char126}}17\% of the legume foliage inclusion. In vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) for the wilted silages followed a quadratic trend (P{\ensuremath{<}}0.05) with the highest recorded at {\texttt{\char126}}17\% level of C. ensiformis inclusion. It can be concluded that feed related challenges are a major limitation to smallholder dairying on certified organic pineapple farms. The optimal inclusion levels of C. ensiformis foliage into the wilted pineapple by-products overlapped within the range of 10- 17\% for the best silage chemical composition, fermentation characteristics and nutritive value.}

The new IFOAM training manuals address the two basic climatic zones of the Tropics, the Arid and Semi-Arid Tropics, and the Humid Tropics.
For both new manuals, already existing material was collected, screened and condensed into comprehensive training manuals. Additionally, a large number of farmers, trainers and scientists were asked for their experience.
Partner institutions from the Tropics actively collaborated in the development of the manuals. The partners of the manual for the Arid and Semi-Arid Tropics are from Asia (India), Africa (Senegal and Tunisia) and Latin
America (Chile).
The training manuals contain case studies of organic farming systems, describe successful organic marketing initiatives and offer guidelines for the main crops of the Tropics. With the informative text, transparencies and
didactical recommendations the training manuals offer a resource basis for trainers with the idea of encouraging individual adaptation and further development of the material according to need. The training manuals are available on separate CDs in English, French and Spanish.
The training manuals were commissioned by IFOAM and funded through its program IFOAM-GROWING ORGANIC II (I-GO II). The Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) and the Swiss Import Promotion Programme (SIPPO) provided co-funding.},

In this way, explanatory power can be increased compared to separate analyses and overall measures and relationships may be revealed. We will thus pursue to uncover a number of critical issues, including the relative importance of various traits and trait combinations on mixing success. To demonstrate the methods of meta-analysis applicable for variety mixture data, we considered a data set consisting of grain yield and weed ground cover assessments in 16 field trials of six 3-component variety mixtures and their components (part of the Danish BAR-OF field trials). The effects of mixing were analysed separately for each field trial and the results used in a meta-analysis in combination with their standard errors. We also analysed the mixing effects of each mixture by fitting a linear model to the entire data set. Both methods showed an overall positive mixing effect on grain yield and a trend for less weed to be found in variety mixtures. Finally, strengths and shortcomings of the methods are highlighted.}

Initially, the strong following of CA, sharing the values of the IFOAM normative principles, in Minnesota offers many possibilities to bolster popularity and support for small farmers through FMs. 
More specifically, Viennese farmers? markets may be able to gather support for farmers and communities alike if FMs would be seen as independent entities from the more permanent Viennese markets. This would allow for a separate purpose with different goals and values influencing the markets daily actions. 
These comparative farmers? market case studies permit the understanding of the logistics and values of farmers? markets in two cities independent of each other and across two continents. Preliminarily, a lack of prevalent values and ethics in Viennese markets due to the predominant market governance structure lead to a fragmented identity and purpose. Conversely, disjointed governance structures in Minneapolis markets lead to confusion of regulations, yet a variety of values and ethics clearly influencing the markets. The shared knowledge of this research should help both researchers and farmers? market managers to exchange information and ideas that may contribute to the success of FMs and ultimately support small farmers.

Den stigende handel og aktivitet p{\r a} tv{\ae}rs af landegr{\ae}nser, som vi kalder globalisering, er bl.a. drevet af udviklingen af Internet, mobiltelefoner m.m.

        abstract = {Increasing globalization affects agricultural production and trade and has consequences for the sustainability of both conventional and organic agriculture. 

During the last decades, agricultural production and yields have been increasing along with global fertilizer and pesticide consumption. This development has been especially pronounced in the industrialized countries and some developing countries such as China, where cereal yields have increased a remarkable twofold and 4.5-fold respectively since 1961. In those countries, food security has increased, a greater variety of food has been offered and diets have changed towards a greater share of meat and dairy products. However, this development has led to a growing disparity among agricultural systems and populations, where especially developing countries in Africa have seen very few improvements in food security and production. The vast majority of rural households in developing countries lack the ecological resources or financial means to shift into intensive modern agricultural practices as well as being integrated into the global markets. At the same time, agricultural development has contributed to environmental problems such as global warming, reductions in biodiversity and soil degradation. Furthermore, pollution of surface and groundwater with nitrates and pesticides remains a problem of most industrialized countries and will presumably become a growing problem of developing countries. Nitrate pollution is now serious in parts of China and India. The growing global trade with agricultural products and the access to pesticides and fertilizers have changed agricultural systems. Easier transportation and communication has enabled farms to buy their inputs and sell their products further away and in larger quantities and given rise to regions with specialized livestock production and virtual monocultures of e.g. Roundup Ready soybeans in Argentina. Since 1996, the Argentinean area devoted to soybeans has increased remarkably from 6 to 14 million ha, covering approximately 50\% of the land devoted to major crops in 2003. Since 1997, Brazilian Amazon has seen a deforestation of more than 17,000 km2 each year with medium or large-scale cattle rangers presumably being the key driving force.

Organic farming offers a potentially more sustainable production but has likewise been affected by globalization. Organic farming is practiced in approximately 100 countries of the world and the area is increasing. European countries have the highest percentage of land under organic management, but vast areas under organic management exist in e.g. Australia and Argentina. Europe and North America represents the major markets for certified organic products, accounting for roughly 97\% of global revenues. The international trade with organic products has two major strands: i) trade between European and other Western countries (USA, Australia, New Zealand); and ii) South?North trade, involving production sites, most importantly in Latin America, which ship to major Northern organic markets. The recent development holds the risk of pushing organic farming towards the conventional farming model, with specialization and enlargement of farms, increasing capital intensification and marketing becoming export-oriented rather than local. Furthermore, as the organic products are being processed and packaged to a higher degree and transported long-distance, the environmental effects need to be addressed. Organic farming might offer good prospects for marginalized smallholders to improve their production without relying on external capital and inputs, either in the form of uncertified production for local consumption or certified export to Northern markets. However, in order to create a sustainable trade with organic products focus should be given to issues like trade and economics (Chapters 4 and 5), certification obstacles, and ecological justice and fair trade (Chapters 2 and 3). Furthermore, the implications of certified and non-certified organic farming in developing countries need to be addressed (Chapters 6 and 9) including issues on soil fertility (Chapter 8) and nutrient cycles (Chapter 7) and the contribution to food security (Chapter 10).},

On mixed dairy farms a simple N balance method was used to estimate N surplus and N leaching loss. On arable farms the simple N balance method was unreliable due to changes in the soil N pool. Consequently, the FASSET simulation model was used to estimate N surplus, N leaching loss and the changes in the soil N pool. 
The study found a lower N leaching loss from organic than conventional mixed dairy farms, primarily due to lower N inputs. On organic arable farms the soil N pool was increasing over years but the N leaching loss was comparable to conventional arable farms. The soil N pool was primarily increased by organic farming practices and incorporation of straw. The highest increase in the soil N pool was seen on soils with a low level of soil organic matter. The level of N leaching loss was dependent on soil type, the use of catch crops and the level of soil organic matter, whereas incorporation of straw had a minor effect. N leaching was highest on sandy soils with a high level of soil organic matter and no catch crops. The study stresses the importance of using representative data of organic and conventional farming practices in comparative studies of N leaching loss.},

        abstract = {The import of organic products to Denmark has seen a four to five fold increase during the last seven years,
due to a growing demand for organic products. Globally, the market for organic food and drinks has also
more than doubled during the same period. The global organic agricultural land has concurrently expanded
from 26 to 35 million hectares, mostly due to major conversions in Argentina, China, India, Australia, USA
and Brazil. While Europe and North America still makes up the major markets for organic food and drink,
the extraordinary growth in the organic markets offers export opportunities for both developed and
developing countries. The production and export of organic products in developing countries might offer
both economic and environmental benefits, though this has mainly been investigated in Europe and North
America. However, long-distance trade with organic products has also given rise to a debate on the
sustainability of this development especially with regard to global warming. Consumers of organic products
might ask themselves what are the environmental benefits of buying organic products from e.g. South
America or Asia as compared to conventional production and is this outweighed by the long-distance trade?

The overall aim of the present PhD study was to assess the environmental impacts of selected imported
organic products from developing countries based on impacts during both production (as compared to
conventional) and during processing and transport to Denmark. Firstly, the global trade, development and
overall environmental impacts of organic agriculture and food systems were investigated to form the
foundation for the further analysis. Organic soybeans from China and orange juice from Brazil were selected
as relevant case studies. Secondly, environmental life cycle assessments (LCA) were conducted for the case
studies in China and Brazil focusing on comparing organic with conventional cultivation and on identifying
environmental hotspots of the imported organic product during production, processing and transport to
Denmark. Thirdly, LCA was evaluated as a tool for evaluating the environmental soundness of organic
agricultural products and a new methodology on including of soil carbon sequestration in LCA was
suggested.

The PhD study shows that the increasing globalization affects both conventional and organic agriculture and
food systems. Major environmental problems with regard to agriculture and food systems are identified as
global warming, nutrient enrichment and pollution of water resources, reductions in biodiversity and soil
degradation. The growing global trade and development within organic food and farming systems holds a
potential to offer economic and environmental benefits for developing countries, but at the same time holds a
risk of increasing the environmental load from long-distance transport and of pushing organic food and
agricultural systems toward the conventional farming model and thereby diminishing the environmental
benefits of organic farming.

The case studies in China and Brazil show that the total greenhouse gas emissions associated with imported
organic soybeans from China is 429 kg CO2 eq. per tonne soybean, whereas imported organic orange juice
from small-scale farmers in S{\~a}o Paulo, Brazil is 424 g CO2 eq. per litre orange juice. Transport accounts for
50-60\% of the total greenhouse gas emissions from the imported organic plant products. As a comparison,
transport only account for 1-15\% for imported meat products, since the greenhouse gas emissions per kg
meat is a lot higher than for plant products. However, the actual contribution from transport is the same. The
mode of transport is a determining factor in that truck transport has a much higher greenhouse gas emission
per km than sea transport. Thus, sea transport from South America (reloaded to trucks in Rotterdam) is
comparable to truck transport from Italy and France and lower than truck transport from Spain and sea
transport from South Africa and China (also reloaded in Rotterdam) in terms of greenhouse gas emissions
per kg imported product. It should be noted that greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural production
can vary (due to inputs, yields etc.) among countries and in some cases outweigh the emissions from
transport.

Comparing organic and conventional small-scale production until farm gate in the case studies, greenhouse
gas emissions per kg organic product is found to be 60-75\% of a comparable conventional production in the
case study area. The nutrient enrichment (eutrophication) per kg organic product is 38-82\% of a comparable
conventional production whereas land use per kg organic product is 10-13\% higher. Higher crop diversity is
found on small organic compared to small conventional orange farms in Brazil, which may have a positive
effect on biodiversity along with the absence of pesticides and the interrow vegetation. No differences are
found in biodiversity potential in the Chinese case study except the absence of pesticides. Comparing large
and small organic orange farms in Brazil, greenhouse gas emissions, eutrophication potential and copper use
per hectare is found to be significantly lower on organic small-scale than on large-scale organic orange
plantations.

The shortcomings of LCA as a tool for evaluating environmental soundness of agricultural products,
especially with regards to including biodiversity and soil carbon changes, are discussed. The studies in Brazil
and China find that including estimated soil carbon changes widens the difference in greenhouse gas
emissions per kg product between organic and conventional, but there is a need for methodological
development on how to estimate and include this. A methodological approach to include soil carbon changes
in LCA is suggested.}

Dazu wurden in f{\"u}nf Regionen eine schriftliche Befragung von 400 {\"O}kobetrieben und ausf{\"u}hrliche Interviews mit 25 ihrer Verp{\"a}chter durchgef{\"u}hrt und mittels quantitativer und qualitativer Verfahren ausgewertet.
Es stellte sich heraus, dass die befragten {\"O}kobetriebe seit der Umstellung auf {\"o}kologischen Landbau ihre Fl{\"a}chen im Durchschnitt um ca. 23\% ausdehnen konnten. Insgesamt sind sie zurzeit in den Untersuchungsregionen immer noch gr{\"o}{\ss}er als der Durchschnitt aus allen Betrieben, jedoch sind sie nicht so schnell gewachsen wie der Durchschnitt.

1. Das praktische Interesse war, im Rahmen von drei Fallstudien Interaktions- und Kommunikationsprozesse zwischen verschiedenen Akteuren in der Kette von Bio-Frischgem{\"u}se zu analysieren, zu initiieren und zu entwickeln. Die wissenschaftliche Begleitung erfolgte mit dem Ziel, die Koordination im Sinne einer Wertsch{\"o}pfungspartnerschaft zu verbessern. 
2. Theoretisches Ziel war es, verallgemeinerbare Erkenntnisse {\"u}ber die Gestaltung komplexer Ver{\"a}nderungsprozesse in vernetzten Lieferstrukturen des Bio-Marktes zu gewinnen. Diese Erkenntnisse sollten mit theoretischen Erkenntnissen verkn{\"u}pft werden. 
3. Auf dieser Grundlage sollten allgemeine Methoden entwickelt werden, die Ver{\"a}nderungsprozesse in den vernetzten Lieferstrukturen des Bio-Marktes unterst{\"u}tzen.
Analytische Ergebnisse: Im Projekt BIOKOOP wurden die Ursachen f{\"u}r das sich in Deutschland seit Jahren reproduzierende Ph{\"a}nomen ?nicht genutztes Potential heimisches/ regionales Bio-Gem{\"u}se? analysiert. Ergebnis ist, dass der Fokus nicht allein auf die (in der Wissenschaft und Politik bisher favorisierte) Perspektive auf den Einzelerzeugerbetrieb gerichtet werden sollte. Vielmehr liegen wichtige Ursachen in den Interaktionen in den Lieferketten, aber auch in den regionalen Bio-Gem{\"u}senetzwerken. Auf allen drei Ebenen sind Ver{\"a}nderungen notwendig, um aus dem Potential von regionalem Bio-Gem{\"u}se erfolgreich Wert zu sch{\"o}pfen. Folglich sind verschiedene Akteure f{\"u}r einen Ver{\"a}nderungsprozess einzubinden.
Praktische Ergebnisse: Durch das Zusammentreffen verschiedener Akteure im Projekt BIOKOOP sind neue Absatzbeziehungen entstanden oder bestehende ausgebaut worden. Auf den BIOKOOP Workshops wurde einerseits innerhalb des regionalen Netzwerkes die Situation analysiert zwischen Produzenten, Zwischenhandel, Einzelhandel (konventionell und bio) und auf Erzeuger- und Zwischenhandelsebene Zukunftsstrategien diskutiert. Die BIOKOOP-Veranstaltungen lieferten neben strukturierter Diskussion auch aktuelle Experteninformationen aus Forschungseinrichtungen und Bio-Verb{\"a}nden. Die Unsicherheit bez{\"u}glich der Einsch{\"a}tzung der Nachfrage nach regionalen Bio-Produkten wurde durch Kundenbefragungen im Rahmen der Hochschul-Ausbildung gekl{\"a}rt. In den Fallstudienregionen wurden somit Anst{\"o}{\ss}e gegeben und Prozesse initiiert, um in den vier Kooperationsfeldern von Wertsch{\"o}pfungsnetzwerken weitere, regional angepasste Ma{\ss}nahmen zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. Dabei gilt es f{\"u}r die Akteure auch zuk{\"u}nftig, Widerst{\"a}nde auf den Problemebenen konstruktiv und kooperativ zu bearbeiten. 
Methodische Ergebnisse: Das Projekt zeigt auf, wie Akteure in einem strukturierten und moderierten Prozess gemeinsam die Ursachen von Ver{\"a}nderungs-, Wachstums- und Umstellungshindernissen erfassen und verstehen k{\"o}nnen und welche Strategieoptionen zur Realisierung neuer Marktchancen zur Verf{\"u}gung stehen. Im Ergebnis  entstand ein Leitfaden f{\"u}r Akteure aller Ebenen der Wertsch{\"o}pfungskette zur Identifizierung neuer Wachstumschancen sowie eine Methodenbox zur Implementierung nachhaltiger Bio- bzw. Regionalstrategien. Dabei liegt der Fokus auf den Potentialen einer verbesserten Koordination und Kooperation der beteiligten Akteure. Der BIOKOOP Leitfaden f{\"u}hrt die Akteure durch alle relevanten Aspekte der Thematik und unterst{\"u}tzt somit das Erarbeiten konsistenter Strategien, die Werte, Interessen und Ziele ausbalancieren.},

        abstract = {Im folgenden Beitrag sollen auf der Grundlage des in den Agrarberichten der Bundesregierung ver{\"o}ffentlichten Zahlenmaterials f{\"u}r die Jahre 1990 ? 1999 Problemfelder im Vergleich des {\"o}kologischen mit dem konventionellen Landbau dargestellt und diskutiert werden.

Schlu{\ss}folgerungen:
-	Der integrierte Landbau, der sich aus dem konventionellem Landbau entwickelt und der {\"o}kologische Landbau werden auch zuk{\"u}nftig die unter dem Aspekt der Nachhaltigkeit bestimmenden Bodennutzungssysteme bleiben.
-	Die Anteile dieser Bodennutzungssysteme an der landwirtschaftlichen Produktion werden durch den Markt und die gesellschaftliche Akzeptanz ma{\ss}geblich bestimmt. Dabei darf es nicht um ein destruktives ?entweder ? oder? sondern mu{\ss} es um ein effektives ?sowohl als auch? gehen.
-	Die Vorteile der jeweiligen Bodennutzungssysteme m{\"u}ssen st{\"a}rker auch unter Umweltaspekten entwickelt und die Nachteile abgeschw{\"a}cht werden. Besonders pr{\"a}gnant l{\"a}{\ss}t sich diese Schlu{\ss}folgerung am Beispiel der gegenw{\"a}rtigen BSE-Problematik diskutieren. Jeder Landwirt, unabh{\"a}ngig davon f{\"u}r welches Bodennutzungssystem er sich entschieden hat, ist durch die ersten in Deutschland nachgewiesenen BSE-F{\"a}lle verunsichert. Es ist v{\"o}llig irrelevant, die Ursachen f{\"u}r BSE allein in der F{\"u}tterung, dem Tierzukauf, der Haltung oder gar der Herdengr{\"o}{\ss}e  usw. zu suchen. Die Ursachen sind offensichtlich sehr komplex und zum gro{\ss}en Teil noch unbekannt. Sicherlich wird im {\"o}kologischen Landbau die BSE-Infektion {\"u}ber die Verf{\"u}tterung von Tiermehl weitestgehend auszu-schlie{\ss}en sein. Wie kann aber ein Verbraucher von der Qualit{\"a}tssicherung im {\"o}kologi-schen Landbau {\"u}berzeugt werden, wenn beispielsweise bei einer zugekauften Mutterkuh in einem {\"O}ko-Betrieb BSE nachgewiesen wird. Der Imageverlust bei den Verbrauchern trifft meistens die Land- und Nahrungsg{\"u}terwirtschaft als Ganzes.
-	Der {\"o}kologische Landbau sollte als eine wesentliche S{\"a}ule des umweltgerechten Landbaus st{\"a}rker agronomisch weiterentwickelt und gesellschaftlich gef{\"o}rdert werden, da{\ss} er seine Marktf{\"a}higkeit auch in einem gr{\"o}{\ss}eren Marktsegment beweisen kann.

        abstract = {The aim of the study was to determine the actual dispersal of N and P from cattle slurry on permanent grasslands in the Low Beskid Mountains located in the Polish segment of the Western Carpathians. This has a special impact on environmental conservation and quality of life in rural submontane areas. The study used slurry from Simmental and HF cattle. The experiment was conducted on 120 ha of pastures and mown meadows in a clay loam soil. Data were statistically analysed with Statgraph using Duncan?s test. After slurry application,  N, P, K content and NH3 emission were measured, and chemical analysis of the plant material was performed. Initial N and P content in meadows was 15.85 and 34.5 kg/ha; in pastures, N content was about 50\% higher and P content about 30\% lower. This N to P ratio in permanent grasslands resulted, among others, from N loss through emission and leaching. Over 22\% and 27\% N were leached in meadow and pasture. P loss from leaching was 5.5 kg. The use of slurry as a fertilizer also led to N loss through emission. Following slurry application, N emission as ammonia was 9.8 kg in meadow and 28.9 kg in pasture. Accumulation of elements in grass yields of meadows and pastures was 70.77 ? 78.23 kg for N and 20 ? 16.5 kg for P. Several technological factors of dairy farming contribute to periodic variations in the biogenic amines content of natural fertilizers. Before their use as fertilizer, the essential and permissible doses must be calculated based on current chemical analyses. Classical methods of soil slurry application cause large N losses as NH3 emissions. N loss from leaching is directly proportional to N content in a single fertilizer dose. This observation refers to the permissible level of 170 kg N/ha. P fertilization also involved a high level of leaching, which is directly related to an almost 80\% content of mineral P in cattle slurry.},

        abstract = {Production diseases, such as metabolic and reproductive disorders, mastitis, and lameness, emerge from complex interactions between numerous factors (or variables) but can be controlled by the right management decisions. Since animal husbandry systems in practice are very diverse, it is difficult to identify the most influential components in the individual farm context. However, it is necessary to do this to control disease, since farmers are severely limited in their access to resources, and need to invest in management measures most likely to have an effect. In this study, systemic impact analyses were conducted on 192 organic dairy farms in France, Germany, Spain, and Sweden in the context of reducing the prevalence of production diseases. The impact analyses were designed to evaluate the interrelationships between farm variables and determine the systemic roles of these variables. In particular, the aim was to identify the most influential variables on each farm. The impact analysis consisted of a stepwise process: (i) in a participatory process 13 relevant system variables affecting the emergence of production diseases on organic dairy farms were defined; (ii) the interrelationships between these variables were evaluated by means of an impact matrix on the farm-level, involving the perspectives of the farmer, an advisor and the farm veterinarian; and (iii) the results were then used to identify general system behaviour and to classify variables by their level of influence on other system variables and their susceptibility to influence. Variables were either active (high influence, low susceptibility), reactive (low influence, high susceptibility), critical (both high), or buffering (both low). An overall active tendency was found for feeding regime, housing conditions, herd health monitoring, and knowledge and skills, while milk performance and financial resources tended to be reactive. Production diseases and labour capacity had a tendency for being critical while reproduction management, dry cow management, calf and heifer management, hygiene and treatment tended to have a buffering capacity. While generalised tendencies for variables emerged, the specific role of variables could vary widely between farms. The strength of this participatory impact assessment approach is its ability, through filling in the matrix and discussion of the output between farmer, advisor and veterinarian, to explicitly identify deviations from general expectations, thereby supporting a farm-specific selection of health management strategies and measures.},

Based on those considerations method B was considered to be the most appropriate method for trials where tests for interaction between the two factors were important and thus this method was used and most of the paper deals with trials based on this construction method. 

The incomplete split-plots were superior to traditional split-plots in most cases ? and the increase in efficiency of the designs can be quite large ? especially for comparisons involving the whole-plot treatment. The efficiency for the comparison of the main effect of the whole-plot treatment was in most cases larger for randomized complete block design than for the incomplete split-plot design, but for other comparisons the proposed designs were in most cases more efficient than a randomized complete block design. The efficiency of the designs was compared to traditional split-plot designs and randomized complete block designs using 3 types of data. The 3 types were simulated data with known covariance structure, data from uniformity trials and data from actual trials using incomplete split-plot designs for comparing cereal varieties under different growing conditions. It is concluded that the incomplete split-plot designs may be a good alternative to traditional split-plots and a good compromise between split-plots and randomised complete blocks.

This paper is a contribution to that question by examining the relationships between some important growth characteristics in barley trials in both systems in Northern Sweden and in Denmark. Mixed model analyses were used for regressions of growth characteristics (or transformations of those) on yield (and log-transformed yield), allowing the slope to depend on the growing system.  The analyses showed that diseases seemed to have a less negative effect on yield in the organic growing system than in the conventional growing system if pesticides were not applied. For other characteristics the effect depended on the country. This was the case for grain characteristics where the effect of volume weight in the Swedish trials was much larger in the conventional growing system than in the organic growing system, while a non-significant difference in the opposite direction was found for the trails from Denmark. For the trials from Denmark the effect of grain weight was much larger in the organic growing system than in the conventional growing system, but there was only a small and non-significant difference in the Swedish trials. In both countries there was a significant interaction between the two grain characteristics.},

        abstract = {The increasing interest in organic farming has increased the interest in examining the importance  of the different growing characteristics, such as attack of diseases, grain weight, lodging and  heading date. One of the important questions raised was whether the relationship between the growing characteristics and yield would be the same for conventionally and organically grown crop or would some growing characteristics be more important for organically than for conventionally grown crops. This work will focus on that question. 
The analyses are performed using two datasets with comparable trials in both conventional and organic grown systems for barley (Hordeum vulgare). The two datasets were from Sweden and Denmark. From Sweden 22 conventional and 22 organic grown trials were available. The trials were laid out at 4 locations in Northern Sweden during the years from 1994-2003. The number of varieties per trial varied between 7 and 15 and 50 varieties were represented. Most of the trials were laid out as split-plot designs with 2 nitrogen levels in the conventional grown trial and 2 seed rates in the organic grown trials. From Denmark 4 conventional and 4 organic grown trials were available. The trials were laid out as a-designs at 2 locations in 2 years (2003 and 2004). 
The number of varieties per trial varied between 108 and 113 and 146 varieties were represented. The data from each country were analysed in a linear mixed model. The effects of location, year, variety, their interaction and interaction with system were included as random effect. The effect of growing system and growing characteristics were included as fixed effects to see how much of the variation caused by varieties and interaction with varieties that could be explained by the growing characteristic and to se if the effect of the growing characteristics depended on the growing system. 
The analyses showed that the growing characteristics could explain a considerable part of the variance components for variety or interaction with variety. The effect of some growing characteristics depended significantly on the growing system, but the results varied to some extent between the two countries. In Sweden the effect of volume weight were more important in the conventional grown trials than in the organic grown trials whereas in Denmark grain weight was more important in the organic grown trials than in the conventional grown trials. In Denmark powdery mildew decreased the yield significantly more in conventional grown trials than in organic grown trials. In most cases the other diseases decreased the yield more in the organic grown trials than in the conventional grown trials. In some models the yield in organic grown trials increased as the level of scald attach increased. The results indicated that the effect of a given disease level decreased the yield more in the conventional grown trials than in the organic grown trials ? or in some cases increased the yield in the organic grown trial while the yield in conventionally grown trials were increased less or decreased.

        abstract = {The growing interest in organic farming has increased the interest in examining if different growing characteristics among varieties would explain differences in yield differently in conventional compared to organic systems.  This work will focus on that question. The analyses are performed using data from trials with spring barley in Denmark and Sweden. Growing characteristics on diseases, volume weight, grain weight, and lodging will be included in the work. 
The growing characteristics are included as covariates to see how much of the variation caused by varieties and interaction with varieties that can be explained by the growing characteristic. The model is setup in order to estimate simultaneously the effect of the growing characteristics and the possible interactions between those that can be expected to interact. 
The analyses showed that the relation between yield and the growth characteristics volume weight or grain weight depended on the growing system but in different ways in the two countries. The relation between yield and the disease powdery mildew were stronger in the conventional grown trials than in the organic grown trials. There was a tendency for the same difference to apply for the diseases leaf rust, net blotch and scald in Danish trials and net blotch in Northern Sweden, but not for scald in Northern Sweden. None of the tendencies were significant at the 5\% level.

        abstract = {Grass-clover is an important element in crop rotations due to its beneficial agronomic properties including nitrogen build-up, stimulation of earthworms and their burrowing and maintenance of soil macropores. We studied the relationship between important elements of grass-clover management in a crop rotation and earthworm diversity and macropore depth distribution, diameter and density from the ploughing layer to a depth of one meter. Treatments included winter rye, 1st year cutting + slurry, 3rd year cattle grazing + slurry, 3rd year cutting + slurry and 3rd year cutting without slurry. The four-species earthworm assemblages and their burrow spatial structure responded distinctly to the temporal sequence of farming system management elements. The relative density of the endo-anecic and epi-anecic earthworm species, Aporrectodea longa and Lumbricus herculeus, was higher in the grass-clover phase of the rotation than under the annual crop, and increased with the age of grass-clover. The same was true for Aporrectodea rosea, but density and biomass of Aporrectodea caliginosa showed the opposite trend. Cattle grazing favours the occurrence of burrows ({\ensuremath{>}}5 mm ?) made by the anecics, A. longa and L. herculeus, while otherwise decreasing the number of fine-medium macropores ({\ensuremath{<}}5 mm ?) below the topsoil. Our study reveals the intimate interdependence between the cropping sequence and the earthworm burrow structure with low number of detectable burrows under annual crops, then increasing in number during the grass-clover over 3 years. The highest number of burrows was found at 0.5 m depth in 3rd year cutting {$\pm$} slurry, presumably because there is no soil disturbance by tillage in this horizon.  The density of the endogeic A. caliginosa was negatively correlated with the presence of burrows and sensitive to grazing cattle compacting the topsoil. Positive correlations between burrows and density of L. herculeus indicate that this species was responsible for the burrows at one m depth while the density of A. longa was positively correlated with the burrows in the Ap horizon. We discuss the species composition in the grass-clover rotation system and its influence on soil ecosystem functioning.},

In order to have a free and informed choice between organic and conventional foods, an objective assessment of a product quality based on a sound scientific knowledge is needed. The aim of this project was an investigation of the influence of growing conditions on the potato (Solanum tuberosum) quality. Two traditional varieties (Katka and Finka) were grown at two different localities in Czech Republic. To determine a possible inter-annual variability, the experiments were performed on crops over a period of three consecutive years (2008 ? 2010). The monitored parameters included biologically active compounds (chlorogenic acid, reducing sugars, amino acids, vitamin C etc.) and also toxic secondary metabolites (total glycoalkaloids and calystegines). Levels of these biologically active compounds depended mainly on the variety and climatic conditions such as year of farming, but the type of a cultivation system did not play a significant role. The currently investigated natural toxic alkaloids calystegines were found at higher concentration levels than the natural toxicants glycoalkaloides, monitoring of which is required by legislation.  },

        abstract = {Der {\"o}kologische Landbau verzeichnet in Deutschland seit Ende der 1980er-Jahre eine kontinuierliche Ausweitung. Ein Blick hinter die Wachstumsbilanz verr{\"a}t jedoch, dass es neben zahlreichen Neueinsteigern auch viele Betriebe gibt, die den {\"O}kolandbau wieder aufgeben. Da f{\"u}r die politisch erw{\"u}nschte Ausdehnung des {\"o}kologischen Landbaus nicht nur weitere Neueinsteiger, sondern auch m{\"o}glichst wenige Aussteiger erforderlich sind, war es Ziel dieser Arbeit zu untersuchen, welche Betriebe und Motive sich hinter den Ausstiegen verbergen und wie speziell R{\"u}ckumstellungen verhindert werden k{\"o}nnen. Dazu wurden die Agrarstrukturdaten ausgewertet, bundesweit {\"u}ber 700 Aussteiger aus dem {\"O}kolandbau schriftlich nach ihren Motiven befragt und zus{\"a}tzlich 29 pers{\"o}nliche Interviews mit R{\"u}ckumstellern gef{\"u}hrt.
Im Zeitraum 2003 bis 2010 stiegen im Durchschnitt 606 Betriebe pro Jahr aus dem {\"O}kolandbau aus. Ein Drittel davon gab den Betrieb auf. F{\"u}r die Betriebsaufgabe waren in der Regel nicht die {\"o}kologische Bewirtschaftung, sondern die fehlende {\"o}konomische Basis und die fehlende Hofnachfolge ma{\ss}geblich. Mit der Aufgabe der Betriebe gingen h{\"a}ufig Fl{\"a}chen f{\"u}r den {\"O}kolandbau verloren: 60 \% der bisherigen {\"O}kofl{\"a}chen gingen an konventionell wirtschaftende Landwirte {\"u}ber.
Zwei Drittel der Aussteiger kehrten zu einer konventionellen Wirtschaftsweise zur{\"u}ck. Dies entspricht einem durchschnittlichen Anteil von 3,3 \% der {\"O}kobetriebe pro Jahr. Relativ hohe R{\"u}ckumstellungsraten gab es bei den Nebenerwerbsbetrieben, kleinen Betrieben und {\"a}lteren Betriebsleitern. {\"U}berdurchschnittlich stark betroffen waren Schaf- und Ziegenbetriebe sowie Rindermastbetriebe, w{\"a}hrend Betriebe mit Schwerpunkt Feldgem{\"u}se- und Kartoffelanbau eher selten auf eine konventionelle Wirtschaftsweise r{\"u}ckumstellten. In der Regel gab es keinen allein entscheidenden R{\"u}ckumstellungsgrund. Vielmehr war es meist ein B{\"u}ndel von pers{\"o}nlichen, betrieblichen sowie externen Faktoren, das die Betriebsleiter zur R{\"u}ckumstellung bewog. Dabei spielten {\"o}konomische Motive sowie Probleme mit den {\"O}korichtlinien und -kontrollen h{\"a}ufig eine wichtige Rolle.
Die Vielfalt der betrieblichen R{\"u}ckumstellungs-Konstellationen bedingt, dass es keine zentrale und f{\"u}r alle Betriebe passende Stellschraube zur Vermeidung von R{\"u}ckumstellungen gibt. Vorgeschlagen wird vielmehr ein B{\"u}ndel an verschiedenen Ma{\ss}nahmen, das zu einer Verbesserung der Rahmenbedingungen f{\"u}r alle {\"o}kologisch wirtschaftenden Betriebe beitr{\"a}gt, damit eine R{\"u}ckumstellung erst gar nicht zu einem betrieblichen Thema wird. },

The objective of the study was to measure the content of weed seeds in the soil and to evaluate the diversity of the species at the end of the period of converting to organic production. In conventional farming systems without fertilizer (Conv I) and conventional farming with mineral fertilizer (Conv II) herbicides were used for weed control. All the crops in Conv II system received P 25 kg ha-1 and K 95 kg ha-1, but the application rates of mineral nitrogen fertilizer differed. In organic systems (Org I ? organic farming based on winter cover crop and Org II - organic farming based on winter cover crop and manure), the winter cover crops (ryegrass after winter wheat, winter oilseed rape after pea, winter rye after potato) were sown after the harvest and were ploughed into the soil as green manure in spring. The content of annual weed seeds was the lowest in red clover that had 17.7\% less weed seeds in the soil of Org II system compared to control (Conv I). In winter wheat the content of winter annual weed seeds was 50?76\% higher compared to other crops. By the end of 2009 the content of organic carbon (Corg \%) in the soil had increased significantly in both organic systems which results in higher activity of organisms that decrease the viability of weed seeds.}

In India too, the cultivated area under certified organic farming has increased exponentially over a decade. Intensive chemical based farming especially after green revolution has produced deteriorating effect on soil productivity and soil/animals/human health. Organic dairy production systems are knowledge and skill intensive, where the producers are expected to be knowledgeable about production norms, standards and practices for production and processing prescribed under approved standards. National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) standards (2014) Government of India, International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movement, Germany ( IFOAM) Norms for Organic Production and Processing, 2014 and Organic Animal Husbandry Development in Sikkim: The Road Map, Sikkim Organic Mission, Government of Sikkim, 2015 formed the basis for the subject matter of Knowledge test on organic dairy farming. As the knowledge plays a vital in role in promoting and promulgating the practices of any farming.  Therefore, a tool in the form of knowledge test was developed and standardized for measuring the knowledge of stakeholders regarding organic dairy farming practices. A total number of 55 statements were collected in the form of open-ended, multiple choice questions, True/False and Yes/No types, which were served to 30 dairy farmers of village Suchetgarh of block R.S.Pura in sub tropics of Jammu region of Jammu \& Kashmir  Union Territory of India for their response. Data were analyzed for calculating difficulty and discrimination index and 34 statements falling between the difficulty index of 30 to 80 and discrimination index of 0.30 to 0.55 were selected for calculating reliability and validity. Split-half reliability was calculated using Spearman Brown Prophecy Formula and was found to be 0.93. Internal consistency of the knowledge test was calculated using Cronbach?s alpha ({\ensuremath{\alpha}}) and the value was calculated to be 0.83 and was significant (p{\ensuremath{<}}0.05), as Cronbach Alpha can be employed significantly for both binary-type (dichotomous) and large-scale data to judge the internal consistency of the instrument. The validity of knowledge test was established through content validity.  Therefore, the final knowledge test containing 34 statements related to different aspects of organic dairy farming standards such as origin and conversion period, breeds and breeding  aspects, Housing management , Feeding management, Animal Health Management, dairy animal welfare and  Organic  dairy Certification were  standardized. This test is suitable for assessing the knowledge level of the stakeholders for organic dairy farming practices and suitable interventions can be made for enhancing the knowledge, thus converting conventional dairy farmers to organic dairy farmers.},

However, there is limited knowledge about the overall organic box scheme landscape and how it develops. This article explores organic box schemes in four European countries and thus contributes by comparing box schemes of different sizes in different geographical and organisational contexts. Survey results from 44 box schemes were used to analyse box schemes in relation to size and growth, organisation, communication with customers, delivery modes, distances travelled by produce and boxes, and values adhered to. Although the surveyed box schemes differed in size and organisation, similarities between box schemes were found in many aspects. For example, most surveyed box schemes had
grown considerably since their start, and wished to grow further, and they all rated certain values as important. A tendency for larger box schemes to offer more imported produce, to have operated for a longer time, and to use social media for advertising more often was found. Despite the heterogeneity of the box schemes in the survey, we conclude that box schemes are a useful category to explore in the sustainability transition of food systems.}

        abstract = {Markets for ethical products are seemingly faced with an inherent flaw, namely the so-called attitude-behaviour gap. The gap implies that when consumers indicate preferences for ethical products only a minor part actually walk their talk. In response, an extensive literature has developed that attempts to either explain the inconsistency or develop ways of bridging the gap. Despite all these efforts, however, the field of ethical consumption continuous to be riddled with the problem: the gap persists! In this article, instead of treating the gap as a fact to be managed, we suggest that the attitude-behaviour gap emerges as a consequence of a set of theoretical assumptions which are embedded in an neoliberal discourse and which articulate values as essentially stable, endogenous and directive of behaviour. It is our assertion that this discourse not only leaves researchers chasing a mirage, it also traps CSR-businesses in a reactive position, left to await that ethical consumers will eventually begin to walk their talk. Instead, we point to the existence of a parallel neocommunitarian discourse that articulates good consumption behaviour as the results of a flow of dialogues in which various actors (including businesses) play a role in negotiating what is considered right and wrong in a specific context. This discourse, we suggest, open for a much more proactive CSR-approach than does the ethical discourse as it construes a social universe in which it is meaningful for businesses to relate to potential customers and participate in the creation of what is considered ?good consumption?.}

In this report, new high quality, protein rich feedstuffs included microalgae, insects and mussel meal. Protein feedstuffs also contained samples from less known plant feed materials for pigs and poultry, such as sainfoin seeds with hulls or dehulled, grass pea seeds and soybean by-product okara. Feed samples were analysed for dry matter, ash, crude protein, ether extract, crude fibre, neutral and acid detergent fibre, lignin, starch, sugars, amino acids, minerals, phytic acid, phytase activity and in vitro digestibilities according to Boisen and Fern{\`a}ndez (1995, 1997) to predict the standardised ileal digestibility of amino acids (Boisen 2007). MTT, Agrifood Research Finland, analysed all the feed ingredients that were used in the feeding experiments throughout the ICOPP project. By having all samples analysed in the same place, and using the same methodology, it is possible to compare feed ingredients and transfer the results from country to country. Furthermore, there is often lack of information concerning analysed nutrient composition of organically produced feed materials. Information in this report can be used in feed optimisation for pigs and poultry on farms and by feed manufactures. Feedstuff names have been compiled based on EU feed catalogue (EU 575/2011). The calculation of feed energy values for pigs and poultry differs between European countries. In this report, the nutrient contents are translated into the feeding values according to feed evaluation systems used in different European countries. This report contains energy and protein values for pigs based on the French, Dutch and Danish feed evaluation systems. Energy values of feeds were also calculated according the British, German and Swiss feed evaluation systems. Energy values for poultry were presented according to the Finnish and Dutch feed evaluation systems.},

},
        abstract = {Das zentrale Thema der vorliegenden Arbeit ist eine {\"o}konomische Bewertung der Integration von Naturschutzzielen in den {\"O}kologischen Landbau. Die Arbeit wird im Rahmen eines Projektes vom Bundesamt f{\"u}r Naturschutz (BfN) und der Universit{\"a}t Gesamthochschule Kassel (GhK) auf der Dom{\"a}ne Frankenhausen erstellt. Es werden in der Arbeit f{\"u}r einzelne, in der Diskussion stehende Ma{\ss}nahmen sowie f{\"u}r ein Naturschutzszenario Kosten berechnet. Hierzu wird, nach der Erl{\"a}uterung der Methode in Kapitel 2, der f{\"u}r den Naturschutz im {\"O}kologischen Landbau relevante Kenntnisstand in Kapitel 3 dargestellt. Hierbei wird festgestellt, dass der {\"O}kologische Landbau eine f{\"u}r den Naturschutz  vorteilhafte Landbaumethode ist, die jedoch aus Sicht des Naturschutzes in einzelnen Fragen noch weiter optimiert werden muss. Dargestellt werden auch die betriebswirtschaftlich relevanten Informationen der Dom{\"a}ne Frankenhausen. In Kapitel 4 sind die in der Diskussion befindlichen Ma{\ss}nahmen mit ihrem naturschutzfachlichen Hintergrund beschrieben. 
Ein erstes Zwischenergebnis liefert ein Faustzahlen-Katalog in Kapitel 5. Es werden die Kosten f{\"u}r die Naturschutzma{\ss}nahmen berechnet. Hierbei wird folgendes festgestellt:
?	Die meisten Naturschutzma{\ss}nahmen k{\"o}nnen relativ problemlos mit vorhandenen Datenkatalogen berechnet werden.
?	Die teuerste Naturschutzma{\ss}nahme ist der Verzicht auf die landwirtschaftliche Nutzung von Fl{\"a}chen.
?	Relativ kosteng{\"u}nstig ist das Stehenlassen von Brachen und Feldrainen, sowie die Gr{\"u}nlandmelioration.
?	Je nach Kosten des Wildkr{\"a}uter-Saatgutes kann auch die Anlage von Bl{\"u}hstreifen kosteng{\"u}nstig ausfallen. Aus {\"o}konomischer Sicht sollten Saatgut einfacher Kr{\"a}uter- oder Brachemischungen verwendet werden, von Spezialmischungen von deutschen Saatguth{\"a}ndlern wird abgeraten.
?	Der Einsatz von Balkenm{\"a}hern hat auch vergleichsweise niedrige Kosten, es wird von Experten jedoch angezweifelt, ob die Ma{\ss}nahme {\"u}berhaupt einen naturschutzfachlichen Fortschritt bringt.
?	Geringe Kosten verursacht das Einhalten von Schnittzeitpunkten im Gr{\"u}nland. F{\"u}r die F{\"u}tterung ist der sp{\"a}te Schnitt von Silage- und Heufl{\"a}chen sehr aufwendig. Der Verkauf von Futter schlechter Qualit{\"a}t als Pferdeheu ist nur eine Notl{\"o}sung.
?	Die Pflege von Hecken und Solit{\"a}rgeh{\"o}lzen verursacht mittlere Kosten.
?	Die Anlage von Biotopen wie Hecken und Solit{\"a}rgeh{\"o}lzen ist vergleichsweise teuer.
?	Auch die Anlage von Erosionsschutzstreifen ist relativ teuer, da hier nur Hackfr{\"u}chte betroffen sind und h{\"o}here Fl{\"a}chennutzungskosten veranschlagt werden m{\"u}ssen.
In Kapitel 6 wird ein Naturschutz-Szenario f{\"u}r den Betrieb erstellt. Bei den Ma{\ss}nahmen handelt es sich um solche, die wahrscheinlich auf dem Betrieb durchgef{\"u}hrt werden. Es werden die Investitions- und laufenden Kosten f{\"u}r den Betrieb errechnet. Hierbei wird die freiwerdende Arbeit verlustmindernd angerechnet. Kurzfristig (1-5 Jahre) fallen Kosten von 127.014 ?, d.h. 438 ?/ha an. Mittel- bis langfristig (5-20 Jahre) sinken die Kosten auf 72.125 ?, d.h. auf 249 ?/ha. Der Anteil der Naturschutzfl{\"a}che an der gesamten landwirtschaftlichen Nutzfl{\"a}che betr{\"a}gt in dem Szenario 16,2 \%, so dass die Forderung nach 10 \% Anteil Biotopfl{\"a}che im neuen Naturschutzgesetzes ({\S} 3,1) damit umgesetzt ist.
In der Diskussion in Kapitel 7 wird zun{\"a}chst eine betriebswirtschaftliche Einordnung der Kosten vorgenommen. Hierbei wird als Referenz auf durchschnittliche Daten aus dem Agrarbericht 2001 zur{\"u}ckgegriffen. Es wird festgestellt, dass die Investitionskosten bei Umlage und Verzinsung {\"u}ber 25 Jahre f{\"u}r den Betrieb tragbar sind. Die laufenden Kosten sind nur bei {\"o}konomischen Spitzenergebnissen f{\"u}r den Betrieb tragbar. Erst bei der Kalkulation von geringeren Fl{\"a}chennutzungskosten sind die laufenden Kosten mittelfristig tragbar, langfristig kann der Betrieb nur bei Fortfall der Fl{\"a}chennutzungskosten {\"o}konomisch wirtschaften.
Im Vergleich mit anderen Untersuchungen fallen die in dieser Arbeit berechneten Kosten h{\"o}her aus. Die Ergebnisse wurden mit Untersuchungen {\"u}ber Naturschutz mit einzelbetrieblicher und regionaler Ausrichtung verglichen. Hierbei wird folgendes festgestellt:
?	Bei allen Vergleichsuntersuchungen werden niedrigere Fl{\"a}chennutzungskosten berechnet. 
?	Bei den Untersuchungen mit einzelbetrieblichem Zuschnitt fallen die Kosten f{\"u}r einzelne Ma{\ss}nahmen g{\"u}nstiger aus. Die Ergebnisse sind jedoch aus verschiedenen Gr{\"u}nden (zu niedrige Fl{\"a}chennutzungskosten, zu niedrige Arbeitsl{\"o}hne) {\"o}konomisch nicht {\"u}berzeugend. 
?	Nur eine Untersuchung stellt Details der Naturschutzma{\ss}nahmen ausf{\"u}hrlicher dar. Der Umfang der Naturschutzma{\ss}nahmen ist hier weitaus geringer, so dass sich auch daraus die g{\"u}nstigeren Kosten erkl{\"a}ren.
?	Die Vergleichsuntersuchungen mit regionalem Zuschnitt befassen sich vor allem mit Auflagen f{\"u}r die Gr{\"u}nland-Bewirtschaftung. Die Kosten dieser Vergleichsuntersuchungen fallen geringer aus, was mit geringeren Fl{\"a}chennutzungskosten und mit einem niedriger angenommenen Energieverlust beim Futter erkl{\"a}rt wird. 
Am Schluss der Arbeit wird ein Ausblick auf in dem Zusammenhang wichtige Fragestellungen f{\"u}r Folgeuntersuchungen gegeben. },

        abstract = {Organic sectors and markets differ throughout Europe, but common to all is that local organic market initiatives have inherent problems in moving from niche to volume (both in terms of management and logistics or course, but also in terms of maintaining their core values) and often , while mainstream large-scale market chains have inherent problems in securing and advancing organic values. This has been amply studied within agrifood studies and especially within the conventionalisation debate. However, beyond these often dichotomized views, an assessment of the diversity of organic chains in diverse European countries has showed the existence a diversity of intermediary cases which can be considered as midscale ?Values Based food chains? (Kvam and Bj{\o}rkhaug 2014). These chains are based on forms of organisations and partnerships between farmers, businesses and consumers that often combine ?conventional? (or mainstream?) and alternative principles and sometimes actors, in order to better mediate values between producers and producers despite or along the growth process. These midscale VBFC?s differ from direct marketing initiatives in the sense that they aim for growth in volume and scale and often include intermediaries, and from the mainstream globalised food chains in that they aim to reconnect producers and consumers (although often not through direct relationships). These forms of marketing initiatives have been less studied in the literature, especially in relation to how these chains are organised and the role of the interactions},

In the four years since the publication of the action plan, there has been significant progress in the development of the organic sector in Wales. Organic production has increased, established organic producer groups and processing, distribution and retailing businesses have thrived, and many new businesses and initiatives have been established, bringing a greater business, social and cultural diversity to the organic community in Wales.

of an EU-wide legal definition, agri-environmental conversion and maintenance payments, rural

integrate supply push and demand-pull measures. The latest CAP round (2023-2027) has delegated 
responsibility for setting organic farming policy to Member States, but with an EU Farm to Fork

This paper charts the development of organic farming in the EU since the 1990s, the motivations for 
policy support, and the types and levels of support implemented in the 2010-2020 period. It analyses 
how Member State plans for policy in the next five years compare with previous periods and whether

        abstract = {?Sustainable intensification? is now often used to describe the future direction for agriculture and food production as a way to address the challenges of increasing global population, food security, climate change and resource conservation. While sustainable intensification is interpreted by some to relate to increasing production, with more efficient but potentially increased use of inputs and technology, there is also a need to consider environmental protection, including the conservation and renewal of natural capital and the output of ecosystem services. There is a growing consensus that sustainable intensification should not only avoid further environmental damage, but actively encourage environmental benefits. 
This includes addressing issues of consumption (including diets), waste, biodiversity conservation and resource use, while ensuring sufficient overall levels of production to meet human needs.
?Agroecology? is also now receiving increasing attention as an approach to agriculture that attempts to reconcile environmental, sustainability and production goals by emphasising the application of ecological concepts and principles to the design and management of agricultural systems. Agroecology can be seen as part of a broader approach to sustainable intensification focusing on ecological (or eco-functional) and knowledge intensification alongside technological intensification.
This report explores how agroecological approaches can contribute to sustainable intensification in the UK and European contexts by: 
- exploring the concepts of ?sustainable intensification? and ?agroecology? (Chapter 2); 
- reviewing the range of individual practices and systematic approaches that are typically defined as agroecological (Chapter 3);
- assessing the extent to which different agroecological approaches can contribute considering the policy drivers and constraints that may affect the adoption of agroecological approaches (Chapter 5);
- presenting some conclusions (Chapter 6).},

             url = {https://orgprints.org/id/eprint/37097/},
        abstract = {The aim of this study was to identify whether, how and at what cost agricultural GHG emissions in Scotland could be reduced by 35\% by 2045. In 2017, Scottish agricultural GHG emissions were estimated to be 7.6 Mt CO2e making the 35\% target 2.7 Mt CO2e.
Building on previous work by SRUC and others, 37 different measures to reduce GHG emissions were evaluated, focusing on improvements in nitrogen fertiliser use, organic manure/slurry storage and use, mechanisation, soil management, cropping systems and management, livestock nutrition, health and breeding, as well as improved farming systems integrating multiple measures, represented by conservation agriculture, organic farming, pasture-fed livestock production and agroforestry.
Land use changes, such as from agriculture to peatland or forestry, as well as non-agricultural activities (including input manufacturing, food processing, retailing and consumption) were outside the scope of the study, although consideration was given to food losses on farms arising from decisions in other sectors. Embodied GHG emissions in inputs and impacts of output changes on other countries were also not assessed.
In theory, if taken up 100\% and accounting for no interactions, the measures could reduce Scottish agricultural emissions by almost 100\%. In practice, there are many reasons why measures might not be implemented in combination, or adopted, by all farmers. We estimated that the most promising measures could potentially deliver 2.9 Mt CO2e annually, or 38\% of 2017 GHG emissions, and concluded that the 35\% target is achievable by 2045.
75\% of Scottish agricultural GHG emissions are related to livestock production. This is not surprising given the importance of grassland and rough grazing in Scottish agriculture, which together account for almost 80\% of agricultural land. Given this context, measures focused on tillage crops are relatively unimportant with respect to their potential for GHG reduction. The measures with most potential (all specified on annual basis) that we identified were:
a) Reduction in nitrogen fertiliser use. Measures to use nitrogen more efficiently, including better use of organic manures, could potentially generate reductions of nearly 350 kt CO2e, or 13\% of the target, within the next 10 years, if adopted on most farms.
b) More radical reductions in nitrogen fertiliser use, by encouraging the use of legumes in grassland to eliminate or substantially reduce the need for N fertiliser, could reduce emissions by nearly 300 kt CO2e, or 11\% of the target, within the next 15 years, if adopted on 40\% of grassland.
c) The use of legumes combined with rotational grazing techniques in diverse-species grassland, which help build soil organic matter and sequester carbon, could increase the total benefit to 540 kt or 20\% of the target. This could potentially be linked with a pasture-fed livestock approach.
d) Reducing methane emissions associated with ruminants by using feed additives including 3NOP, nitrates, probiotics, high dietary fat sources and seaweed derivatives could make a significant contribution. In the case of 3NOP, emissions could be reduced by 265 kt or 10\% of the target within 10 years, if adopted on most dairy and some other cattle farms. This would require approval of 3NOP as a feed additive so that it can be marketed, and that at an affordable price.
e) Improved animal health and breeding, with increased fertility, growth rates and yields, and reduced morbidity/mortality could reduce total livestock numbers needed to deliver the same output, and deliver 366 kt emission reductions (14\% of the target) with 40-50\% uptake.
f) Organic farming, with 40\% uptake, could potentially deliver 730 kt CO2e reductions or 27\% of the target. This is a result of combining no synthetic nitrogen fertiliser use with an overall 10\% reduction in livestock numbers and the conversion of 20\% of tillage land to rotational grassland. The financial impacts of these changes are reduced due to the premium markets for organic food.
g) Agroforestry also offers potential for substantial reductions: 570 kt (21\% of the target) with 30\% uptake. This is assuming 10\% of farmland is used for trees, with consequent output reductions for crops and livestock, although with some scope to mitigate this.
Despite their emission reduction potential, organic farming and agroforestry both have the disadvantages of higher initial investment costs, greater complexity acting as a disincentive to adoption and longer lead-in
times, as well as output reductions that, if demand remains unchanged, could lead to an increased requirement for imports and increased emissions elsewhere. However, the widespread adoption of these approaches would need to be considered in the context of changing human and animal diets, and the potential for reducing food losses and waste also highlighted in the report.
The financial assessment of these measures indicates that many are likely to be associated with increased costs and, in the absence of other financial benefits, reduced incomes, which would need to be addressed by policy support in some form. In several cases, reductions in nitrate leaching, ammonia emissions and other impacts leading to improvements in water and air quality could provide further justifications for support. In some cases, the improved productivity, for example associated with improved animal health and breeding, could create a win-win situation, with emissions reduction combined with financial benefits.
As most of the measures are unlikely to be driven by market forces, policy interventions are likely to be needed, including:
? Farming system payments for innovative approaches (whole or part farm)
? Input reduction and improved soil management, including support for advice and investments
? Regulatory and fiscal options including input taxes and quotas or tradeable carbon quotas linked to input use and sequestration opportunties
? Carbon, nitrogen and sustainability auditing
? Training, advice and skills
? Improved greenhouse gas monitoring and statistics
? Targeted research, and
? Dietary change and food waste reduction
In almost all cases, the practices and systems that could be adopted are well developed and understood, but actions are needed to ensure that financial and knowledge barriers are addressed in order to facilitate their adoption so that the desired GHG mitigation targets can be achieved.}

Data on farm size, crop distribution and livestock intensity prior to conversion and planned after conversion on 448 Danish farms, which began conversion to organic farming in 1997, are presented in adressing two questions: 1) what features characterize Danish farms that convert from conventional to organic farming ?, 2) what do the  farms convert to: do farm types, stocking rates and crop distribution change with conversion ? In 1997, dairy farms dominated among the converting farms in acreage, and a large majority (80-97\%) of the farmers of all farm types planned to continue with the same type of production system after conversion as they had before. Thus, the regional pattern in organic farm types will be similar to that which characterize conventional farms. Although the total number of livestock units on the 448 converting farms is planned to increase by 6\% following conversion to organic farming, the converting farms are well below-average in stocking rates compared with all Danish farms both before and after conversion. Farmers plan changes in crop distribution when converting: a 20\% decrease in the acreage for cereal production, a doubling of the acreage for grassland in rotation, a decrease in  acreages for setaside, row crops and oilseed rape, with roughage and seeds unchanged.  Planned changes in crop distribution differ between farm types. The need for including aspects of diversity and intensity of production on both farm and higher scales in the evaluation of future directions in organic farming is discussed.   },

Size enlargement is examined in a cohort of 236 farms which converted to organic farming in 1997 and remained organic in 2004. In this group the largest 5\% of farms covered 24\% of the area in 1997, increasing to 27\% in 2004. Changes in farm size on a total of 302 organic farms show that a majority of farms increased their size, with larger farms being more likely to enlarge than smaller.

        abstract = {This report is the product of a ten-day mission to Afghanistan, which took place in June 2009. It was organized within the framework of ASMED (Afghanistan Small and Medium Economic Development) - a USAID-funded project, implemented by DAI (Development Alternatives, Inc.). The mission's objective was to initiate the development and support the establishment of an organic product value chain in Afghanistan and identify organic business opportunities that could lead to export. The mission consisted of a two-member consultant team: Martien Lankester, executive director of Avalon (a Netherlands-based, international foundation supporting organic farming in transition countries) and Darko Znaor, an independent organic farming consultant from Croatia working with Avalon as an associated expert. The mission output is this report containing findings and recommendations for the follow up steps required to strengthen the development of organic business and organic scene in Afghanistan. 
Afghan agriculture is at the crossroads, trying to recover from the damage caused by the three decades of fighting and seven years of drought.  Afghanistan has a total agricultural area of 38 million ha, of which grassland accounts for 79\%. Small-scale family farms with irrigated cropping supplemented by livestock prevail in Afghanistan. Most farms are in the range of 2-5 hectares, although many farms are smaller than 2 hectares. The major crops produced in Afghanistan are corn, rice, barley, wheat and vegetables. However, the country is well known for its production and export of raisins, dry fruits and nuts. More than 80\% of Afghanistan's livestock production consists of extensive sheep herding and goat herding. Water is the most limiting factor in determining crop and livestock production in Afghanistan. Due to limited rainfall, Afghan agriculture completely depends on erratic winter snows and spring rains providing water. In many parts of Afghanistan soil fertility is depleted due to overgrazing, deforestation and desertification. Severe overgrazing combined with the recent drought has resulted in a decrease of the livestock population. The reduction and lack of ground cover on hillsides has led to floods and widespread soil erosion. In many regions erosion has increased and soil organic matter has decreased. This contributes to the overall degradation of ecosystems, which can be noticed in many parts of Afghanistan. . 
In spite of claims and the widespread belief that Afghanistan hardly uses any fertilizers and pesticides, information from recent reports suggests widespread use of these agents in arable, fruit and vegetable production. The annual fertilizer consumption is approximately 273,750 t nutrients, which is equivalent to 35 kg of nutrients per hectare of arable land. Nearly 150 active ingredients of pesticides are available in Afghan urban and rural farm stores. The figures and analysis on Afghan fertilizer and pesticide consumption presented in this report challenge the validity of the outdated data available in some international databases. They also suggest that fertilizer (and perhaps pesticide) consumption per hectare of arable land in Afghanistan is comparable to that of some economically more developed countries, e.g. New EU Member States. 
Afghanistan is the world?s most important producer of opium poppy, providing approximately 90\% of the world?s opium poppy supply. Cultivation of opium poppies is by far the most profitable agricultural activity in Afghanistan. The total area planted with poppies appears to be around 200,000 ha, occupying about 3\% of cultivated land. The opium poppy allows many poor rural Afghan families to survive and gain access to land and credit and generate cash income. The poppy is a multi-purpose crop; is easy to grow and no other crop gives such high revenue.
Organic farming is an agricultural system, which excludes agro-chemical inputs (industrial fertilizers, synthetic pesticides, veterinary medicine, etc.) and genetic engineering. The production is governed by a set of standards and legislation and controlled by government (or other) approved inspection and certifying bodies. Organic farming is a rapidly growing sector. Globally, some 700,000 farmers practice this method and more than 30 million hectares are being managed organically. The organic food and drinks market is constantly growing and the value of the global organic market is currently approximately \$45 billion, of which Europe accounts for 52\%.  
Afghanistan is currently one of the very few countries in which the organic farming concept and practice have not found their place yet. Consequently, the country has been lagging in developing an organic market and taking part in the booming international organic market (exporting). Organic farming is relatively unknown in Afghanistan and currently there are very few business initiatives directed towards organic food and agriculture. With the exception of a few liters of rose oil, no other certified organic produce seems to be exported from Afghanistan. It is also one of the few countries that does not have any IFOAM (International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements) member. Afghanistan does have some non-certified organic production, but these are individual efforts and mostly small-scale operators.
In order to support the development of organic agricultural business in Afghanistan it is not sufficient to support just the existing and new organic production, processing and trade initiatives. The organic farming and food business in Afghanistan can only become viable and competitive (especially in the mid and long-term) if a wider enabling environment is put in place, too: accompanying organic policies, research and education, extension and inspection and a certification system. Therefore, besides supporting the Afghan organic business opportunities, it is equally important to support in parallel the establishment of a wider framework enabling the development of the Afghan organic sector as a whole. In this respect, the conclusions and recommendations presented in this report go beyond those concerned with merely the organic business opportunities identified. The mission recommends support at three levels: policy and conceptual context, market development and support to enabling facilities. As a precondition, it is necessary to tackle the issue of ecosystem rehabilitation.
Degraded ecosystems need to be rehabilitated in order to improve soil fertility, an important precondition for any kind of farming but especially for organic farming, which depends more on the fertility of the soil. It is recommended to involve ecosystem experts in designing and implementing several exemplary projects for restoration of degraded ecosystems.
There is a huge gap, lack of information about what organic farming is, and how this concept and practice should be applied in the context of Afghanistan. It is therefore recommended that the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock initiates a study and a series of round tables clarifying the conceptual background of different agricultural methods, their management practices and feasibility in the Afghan context. In order to assess whether the concerns about the widespread adoption of organic farming in Afghanistan are grounded, it is highly recommended that the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock commission a study assessing the consequences of a widespread conversion to organic farming in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan has a variety of crops that can easily be exported as organic, provided they have organic certification. The prime candidates are rose oil, saffron, raisins, almonds, pistachio, dried fruits and herbs. The mission has identified concrete businesses and opportunities, which the ASMED project can support. These include the expansion of the existing rose oil production by Rona Ltd, production of organic raisins and pomegranate juice by Bagram Ltd. and the start of organic saffron production by Red Gold Ltd. Besides, the mission recommends supporting training in preparing organic business plans and a market study providing in-depth information about export feasibility. Finally, ASMED is recommended to assist in supporting a project identifying and selecting prosperous farmers? organisations and co-operatives willing to enter into smallholder farmers? organic inspection and certification scheme and to support inspection and certification training for potential Afghan organic inspectors, leading to the establishment of an Afghan organic inspection and certification body.
In order to catalyze development of the Afghan organic farming sector it is of utmost importance to set up appropriate organizational structures and activities facilitating organic farming training/education, research, extension and demonstration facilities. ASMED is recommended to support the establishment of an Afghan umbrella association for organic farming; a study tour of selected Afghan experts to Europe; setting up of two demonstration activities (smaller and larger-scale); establishment of pilot research and education; and an organic project with street children.

        abstract = {Based on the fact that not all farmers adopt a technology at the same time, it is argued in this paper that the distinction between groups is important because early, medium and late adopters respond differently to economic and non-economic factors when they consider whether to take up organic farming or not. The individual effects on adoption between the groups are identified by the use of multinomial logit analysis. The results provide evidence that there are significant differences in the characteristics between the adopter groups. The findings also reveal that the factors that affect adoption play a different role for early, medium and late adopters, particularly with regard to farming intensity, age, information gathering as well as attitudes of the farmer. More specifically, early adopters were the youngest to adopt organic farming and their decisions were found to be less profit related compared to other groups. Late adoption is constrained by risk considerations, while environmental attitudes and social learning were identified to be important determinants for all adopter groups. Overall, the findings strongly suggest, that for policy measures to be effective, the current state of diffusion has to be taken into account.

This paper explores the sustainability and resilience of a not-for-profit firm that claims to contribute to sustainable development of the food system. We used semi-structured interviews and Holling?s adaptive cycle as a heuristic device to assess what constitutes social and sustainable entrepreneurship in this case, and we discuss the determinants of organizational resilience. The business, Biodynamiska Produkter (BP), has experienced periods of growth, conservation and rapid decline in demand, followed by periods of re-organization. Our results suggest that BP, with its social mission and focus on organic food, meets the criteria of both a social and sustainability entrepreneurial organization. BP also exhibits criteria for organizational resilience: two major crises in the 1970s and late 1990s were met by re-organization (transformation) and novel market innovations (adaptations). BP has promoted the organic food sector in Sweden, but not profited from this. In this case study, resilience has enhanced sustainability in general, but trade-offs were also identified. The emphasis on trust, local identity, social objectives and slow decisions may have impeded both economic performance and new adaptations. Since the successful innovation Ekol{\r a}dan in 2003, crises have been met by consolidation rather than new innovations}

The study was based on wheat, barley, faba bean and potato produced in rigorously controlled long-term field trials comprising 144 experimental plots. Nitrogen isotope analysis revealed the use of animal manure, but was unable to discriminate between plants that were fertilized with synthetic nitrogen fertilizers or green manures from atmospheric nitrogen fixing legumes. This limitation was bypassed using oxygen isotope analysis of nitrate in potato tubers, while hydrogen isotope analysis allowed complete discrimination of organic and conventional wheat and barley grains. It is concluded, that multi-isotopic analysis has the potential to disclose fraudulent substitutions of organic with conventionally cultivated plants.

Consequently, adulteration of organic plants and fraudulent activities for economic profit are increasing. This has spurred the development of sophisticated analytical procedures for testing authenticity. We review the use of multi-element and stable-isotope analysis based on atomic spectroscopy for discriminating between organic and conventional plants. We conclude that inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, stable-isotope analysis of bulk plant tissue, and compound-specific isotope analysis based on isotope ratio-mass spectrometry are promising tools for documenting the fertilization history of organic plants. However, these techniques are challenged by the potential diversity of fertilization practices of organic and conventional plant production. We therefore recommend that analytical techniques are combined and coupled with chemometrics to develop statistical models that can classify the agricultural origin of plant products.}

The crops were cultivated in two years at three geographically different field locations, each accommodating one conventional and two organic cropping systems. The conventional system produced the highest harvest yields for all crops except the nitrogen-fixing faba bean, whereas the dry matter content of each crop was similar across systems. No systematic differences between organic and conventional crops were found in the content of essential plant nutrients when statistically analyzed individually. However, chemometric analysis of multielemental fingerprints comprising up to 14 elements allowed discrimination. The discrimination power was further enhanced by analysis of up to 25 elements derived from semiquantitative ICP-MS. It is concluded that multielemental fingerprinting with semiquantitative ICP-MS and chemometrics has the potential to enable authentication of organic crops.

A review is presented of comparative studies of organic and conventional farming systems, with a special focus upon economic criteria. The different categories of comparison methodologies are critically reviewed. Conclusions are that classic experimentation has a valuable part to play but that more qualitative assessment can also be useful and should be encouraged. Careful allowance should be made for major background differences in management when comparing financial profitability. Longer term case studies, which try to monitor organic systems in their own right, should also be encouraged.}

(93\% of rabbits) and a 50\% increase in the fecal excretion of oocysts was found in spring, particularly in sainfoin pasture (6.5 M. OPG) where the rotation times was shorter. No diarrhoea was observed during the trials, and at slaughter (100 d old) no intestinal macro-lesions were found, but 64\% of the livers had whitish nodules (E. stiedae). Infection by Trichostrongylus sp. was negatively correlated to the daily weight gain. Fecal excretion of E. flavescens may explain partly the lower daily weight gain (-5 g/d) in spring.

        abstract = {Both the challenges and potential benefits of climate change mitigation and adaptation are particularly apparent in Croatia's agricultural sector. In 2004, this sector emitted 3.558 Gg of CO2 equivalent, comprising 12 percent of the country?s anthropogenic GHG emissions in that year. Soil management accounted for 62 percent of these emissions, enteric fermentation (associated with animal digestive systems) accounted for 25 percent, and manure management for 13 percent. However, recent research suggests that the GHG emissions generated by Croatian agriculture and related activities (e.g., energy, farm-inputs, trade, transport, agricultural research, veterinary services) are responsible for 18 percent of all anthropogenic GHG emissions in Croatia. The fertilizer industry is particularly important in this respect: the Petrokemija fertilizer manufacturer alone accounts for 30 percent of Croatia?s national gas consumption and 5 percent of Croatia?s anthropogenic GHG emissions.

The external costs (damage to human health, ecosystems, commercial materials) of the GHG emissions attributable to these sectors have been estimated at 96 million EUR annually, or some 10 percent of the gross value added generated by these sectors. In the hypothetical case of a total conversion to organic farming, there would be no need for fertilizers and the GHG emissions generated by fertilizer manufacturing would be cut to zero. Such a scenario would obviate the need for the extensive investments required to expand the capacity of Croatia?s gas pipeline network, which is currently too small to properly service all users. Moreover, organic farming can also sequester carbon stocks in the soil.

Croatian policy makers have long recognized the environmental potential of organic farming. In 2001 the government adopted legislation supporting organic farming, and in 2003 it introduced direct payments to stimulate its further growth. In 2004 the Ministry of Agriculture adopted a Strategy for Development of Organic Farming in Croatia, calling for the conversion of 10 percent of Croatia?s agricultural area to organic farming by 2010. During 2000-2006, the acreage under organic farming increased from 13 to 6,145 hectares. If this pace of conversion were to be maintained, all Croatian agricultural land would convert to organic farming by 2011. While complete conversion to organic farming is not realistic, movement in this direction could generate significant economic and environmental benefits.

The research base concerning the costs and benefits of climate change adaptation in Croatia is not as advanced as the work done on mitigation. However, Croatian agriculture has been affected by severe drought three times in the current decade. In 2000 and 2003, damages were estimated at \$700 million total for both years combined (3.4 billion kuna). Drought conditions in the summer of 2007 led the government to provide farmers with a further \$80 million (410 million kuna) in assistance from the state budget. Expanded irrigation efforts are underway, but their effectiveness could be undermined by uncertainties concerning future changes in precipitation patterns and levels. Should increased irrigation divert Croatia?s water resources from hydroelectric power generation or industrial or household uses, the costs of adaptation could rise further.

The challenge for Croatia, as for other countries, is to meet its international obligations for GHG emissions reductions and energy use without endangering economic growth. Croatia must also adapt to potential climate change as well as current climate variability, in order to protect vulnerable sectors such as agriculture. Meeting these challenges will require effective, synergistic policies in such sectors as transport, energy, forestry, agriculture, and coastal zone management.

        abstract = {The investigation carried out in this thesis is based on data collected on three organic dairy farms in southern Jutland in Denmark. Two of these farms supplied feedstuff analyses of their hay, and one additional farmer besides these three took part in an interview on their use of hay feeding and production of haymilk.
The sale of dairy products made of haymilk has increased substantially in Austria over the past few years to 4,200 tons of cheese sold in 2011. Haymilk based dairy products are currently being sold in Germany and the interest is increasing in Switzerland. 83 tons of haymilk based cheeses were sold in Denmark in 2011, and there appears to be a market potential haymilk based dairy products in Denmark. The main objective of this thesis was to improve the decision basis for farmers considering switching from silage feeding to hay feeding of their lactating dairy cows. 
A semi-structured group interview with four haymilk producing farmers showed that they had been inspired by other farmers abroad, who produce haymilk, and motivated by a belief in hay being healthier for their cows as well as the ability to obtain a premium for their milk. The interview furthermore showed that their workload was increased in summer and decreased in winter, although the overall workload was more enjoyable now.

No clear effect of conservation method on chemical composition of hays and silages were found, although a trend for lower CP and higher NDF content per kg of DM were seen in hay compared with silage. Structural properties measured with peNDF and CT was found to be more related to TCL and season, which was indicated by cutting number, than used conservation method.

The analysis of lactation curves, which was based on data obtained from three of the haymilk producing farmers, showed that DH cows in parity one and parity three or greater had achieved a higher persistency by switching to hay feeding, albeit their peak yields were reduced with 1.1 and 0.4 kg ECM per day respectively. No difference was found for DH cows in parity two and Jersey cows in parity one and parity two, but Jersey cows in parity three or greater had their peak yield reduced by 1.1 kg ECM per day. Fat and protein percentage increased for DH cows in parity one and parity three or greater. Protein percentage furthermore increased for Jersey cows in parity one whereas no difference was found for the other groups of cows.

The feeding software NorFor predicted hay fed cows to have a lower DMI and ECM production per day when compared with silage fed cows. This clear effect could not be confirmed in the literature as both an increasing and decreasing as well as an unchanged effect was seen. The somatic cell count was decreased for all groups of cows by switching to hay feeding except for DH cows in parity three or greater, which increased, and DH cows in parity one where no difference was found.

The cost of producing one FU of hay was estimated to be 0.70 kroner larger compared with silage (2.77 versus 2.07 kroner per FU). This resulted in a difference in feed cost between 0.19 and 0.56 kroner per kg ECM depending on the ration and the assumed effect of switching to hay feeding on DMI and daily ECM production. The simulated difference between hay and silage feeding was between a loss of 0.01 and a gain of 0.04 kroner per kg ECM across six scenarios tested on seven different types of herds or between -161 and 450 kroner per annual cow.}

This survey was intended to reach a wide audience of landowners that practiced both organic and non-organic farming. Organisations that helped to distribute this survey are listed in Appendix 1. The survey was a voluntary online survey, therefore the assumption is that landowners that took part would have had an interest in this topic and therefore may not be representative of all UK landowners. 
From March 2011 to May 2011 57 landowners participated in this survey, and results from these landowners are discussed.

Para tanto, foram selecionadas seis {\'a}reas de plantio em bases org{\^a}nicas e tr{\^e}s {\'a}reas de plantio convencional, levando-se emconsidera{\c c}{\~a}o o tipo de solo e a topografia. Em cada uma das {\'a}reas escolhidas, foram estabelecidas tr{\^e}s subparcelas representativas dos cons{\'o}rcios adotados, com aproximadamente 1 0 0 m2 cada uma, as quais serviram como repeti{\c c}{\~o}es dentro de cada {\'a}rea. Como indicadores da qualidade do solo, foram analisadas propriedades/ou caracter{\'i}sticas f{\'i}sicas, qu{\'i}micas e biol{\'o}gicas. O experimento foi desenvolvido utilizando-se um delineamento em blocos ao acaso. Os resultados obtidos foram submetidos {\`a} an{\'a}lise de vari{\^a}ncia, tendo sido realizada a compara{\c c}{\~a}o das m{\'e}dias pelo teste de Tukey, ao n{\'i}vel de 5\% de probabilidade. Os aspectos f{\'i}sicos das {\'a}reas convencionais apresentaram diminui{\c c}{\~a}o na porcentagem de agregados e na porosidade do solo, com rela{\c c}{\~a}o as org{\^a}nicas. Comparando-se as diferentes {\'a}reas de cultivo, observou-se que, as {\'a}reas org{\^a}nicas 1, 2 e 5, apresentaram n{\'i}veis de nutrientes no solo superiores {\`a}s {\'a}reas de cultivo convencionais (7, 8 e 9), e {\`a}s demais org{\^a}nicas (3, 4 e 6 ). O sistema de cultivo org{\^a}nico, durante os anos de 1997 a 2000, promoveu melhorias nas propriedades qu{\'i}micas analisadas, principalmente nas {\'a}reas em que o sistema de cultivo org{\^a}nico foi implantado h{\'a} mais tempo, e naquelas onde foram feitas aplica{\c c}{\~o}es de esterco animal.

As condi{\c c}{\~o}es do ambiente-solo no sistema org{\^a}nico favoreceram a macro e mesofauna do solo, promovendo maior diversidade de indiv{\'i}duos nas {\'a}reas org{\^a}nicas do que nas convencionais. Este estudo concluiu que as {\'a}reas de produ{\c c}{\~a}o org{\^a}nica t{\^e}m maior capacidade de promover a qualidade do solo, comparadas com as {\'a}reas de produ{\c c}{\~a}o convencional, devido principalmente, ao uso de rota{\c c}{\~a}o de culturas, {\`a} aplica{\c c}{\~a}o de fertilizantes org{\^a}nicos e ao menor revolvimento do solo, promovendo assim, o aumento do conte{\'u}do de mat{\'e}ria org{\^a}nica do solo.

generation, schooling level, and changes in people?s
environmental habits, was not related to the age of the settlement. Also, the income of a settlement is hardly dependent on agriculture, being mostly affected by distance from urban centers, number of retired people in the household and participation in social programs. Low schooling level and aging of the settlement are determinant factors in the increase of deforestation of Legal Reserves and Areas of Permanent Protection. These data suggest than land reform is still deicient in the Brazilian northeast; it does not prioritize the socioeconomic independence of the settlements and ignore their environmental situation.},

Areas that had the worst physical, visual, and microbiological conditions were those located in the damping zone under agriculture and pasture. The microbiological attributes were sensitive to the different areas, due to the direct relation between negative impact of agriculture practiced in the damping zone and the soil quality within the Biological Reserve studied.},

        abstract = {Die Situation im B{\"a}ckerhandwerk ? in Bezug auf den starken R{\"u}ckgang der Betriebe, fehlende Fachkr{\"a}fte sowie Auszubildende oder den Preisdruck durch industriell gepr{\"a}gte Gro{\ss}b{\"a}ckereien ? ist prek{\"a}r. In der Landwirtschaft entwickelte sich w{\"a}hrenddessen aus dem Bed{\"u}rfnis nach Ver{\"a}nderung das Prinzip der Community Supported Agriculture (CSA). Dieses Konzept wird als eine zukunftsf{\"a}hige Wirtschaftsform mit dem Potential regionale, nachhaltige Ern{\"a}hrungssysteme zu st{\"a}rken, gesehen. Aufbauend auf dieser Erkenntnis wird das CSA-Konzept ? neben Genossenschaften und Kollektiven ? als Option f{\"u}r bestehende und neue Betriebe im B{\"a}ckerhandwerk best{\"a}tigt. Ausgehend von diesen Erkennt-nissen besteht Forschungsbedarf hinsichtlich der {\"U}bertragung der ern{\"a}hrungswirtschaftlichen Unternehmensform der CSA auf das B{\"a}ckerhandwerk (Community Supported Bakery, CSB). Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es, Kriterien f{\"u}r ein CSB-Modell, welches in Anlehnung an das Community Supported X (CSX)-Modell nach Rommel (2017) sowie aufbauend auf Erkenntnissen aus Theorie und Praxis zu CSA bzw. CSB, zu entwickeln. Im Zuge dessen wird die {\"U}bertragung der CSX-Merkmale auf einen CSB-Prototypen theoretisch untersucht. Einerseits wird ermittelt wie das Modell einer CSB als eine zukunftsf{\"a}hige Alternative zum herk{\"o}mmlichen B{\"a}ckereibetrieb aussehen kann und andererseits eruiert, inwieweit Chancen und Risiken bei der praktischen {\"U}bertragung bestehen. Methodisch wird ein Workshop konzipiert, in dem CSA-, CSB-Praktiker und -Interessierte das CSB-Modell sowie die Praktikabilit{\"a}t dessen diskutieren. Erkenntnisse aus dem Workshop werden in Form eines CSB-Modells und eines Fragenkataloges zusammengefasst. Diese dienen gemeinsam mit identifizierten Chancen und Risiken sowie ersten Handlungsempfehlungen als Informationsmaterial f{\"u}r (gr{\"u}ndungswillige) CS-B{\"a}cker und CSX-Praktiker. Weiterhin bilden diese Ergebnisse eine Basis f{\"u}r weitere Forschungen in Bezug auf solidarische und alternative Unternehmensformen f{\"u}r das B{\"a}ckerhandwerk.
Erkenntnisse, die der {\"o}kologischen Landwirtschaft dienen k{\"o}nnten sind beispielsweise, dass das CSA-Konzept eine Alternative f{\"u}r bestehende Unternehmen, gerade auch f{\"u}r biologisch arbeitende Betriebe (von dem/der ErzeugerIn bishin zu dem/der VerarbeiterIn), sein kann und die {\"U}bertragung dessen mit dieser Arbeit erprobt wurde. Weiterhin ist die {\"o}kologische Produktion eine Art Basiskriterium f{\"u}r solidarisches Unternehmertum, um nahr{\"a}umlich und umweltfreundlich zu wirtschaften. Gleichzeitig wuchs das Interesse an dem CSA-Ansatz in den letzten 10 Jahren stark. So wird indirekt die Verbreitung des {\"O}kologischen Landbaus vorangetrieben.},

        abstract = {Nearly 21\% of U.S. organic farmers are women, compared with 9\% of all U.S. farmers. Little research has isolated the factors influencing adoption of organic farming practices by male and female organic farmers. Male organic farmers adopt more weed control practices than female organic farmers and use a different portfolio of techniques. Results from a count data model and a national survey of U.S. organic farmers were used to decompose observed gender differences in technology adoption into a characteristics effect and a coefficient effect. The analysis shows that 40\% of the adoption differential is due to differences in characteristics of male and female organic farmers.  Education, experience, information sources, and institutional support are key factors causing the gender gap in number and type of adopted practices.}

        abstract = {Green biorefinery concepts have the potential to become a suitable solution for production of organic protein-rich feeds from green crops. Different green crops such as alfalfa, red clover and clover grasses are studied as possible feedstocks for the development of an organic biorefinery system with refined proteins, ensiled press cake to be used as cattle feed and residual juice with potentials for fermentation of amino acids, lactic acid or other uses. A process was developed by which screw pressed juice from the freshly harvested crop was used for lactic acid fermentation to decrease the pH and precipitate proteins. These refined proteins have a favourable amino acid content and are comparable with soy proteins, especially for poultry where methionine is a limiting amino acid. For production of experimental feed for different animal trials, a demo-scale set up was made for a continuous refining process, which included harvesting and processing of 400 tons clover grass. The clover grass was processed into a protein concentrate, a fiber-rich press cake, and a residual stream of soluble nutrients. The protein-concentrate was used in experimental feed formulations for egg-laying hens, broilers and pigs. The fiber-rich press cake was ensiled without additives, and used as feed for dairy cows. The novel protein refining technique using lactic acid fermentation showed robust results in large scale. Furthermore, the feed trials in mono-gastric animals (poultry and pigs) show promising results although the digestibility with increasing amount of green proteins show a decreasing trend. In addition, the ensiled press residues surprisingly resulted in a 5-10\% increase in milk production compared with a traditional silage. Further improvements of the technology is expected to lead to feed products with higher digestibility as well as protein products for human consumption.},

LAB play a large role in food fermentation and in silage processes, where crops such as grass, legumes, cereals or corn are fermented into high-moisture feed that is storable and can be used to feed cattle, sheep or other ruminants. LAB also have great applications within green biorefineries, with simultaneous production of protein-rich feed for monogastric animals, silage or feed pellets for ruminants and production of lactic acid or specific amino acids. In green biorefineries, fresh or ensiled wet biomass is mechanically fractionated into green juice and solid residues (press cake), where the plant juice, for example, can be used for production of lactic acid using LAB. In a process named ?ENLAC?, recovery of protein and chlorophyll from silage by simultaneous lactic acid fermentation and enzyme hydrolysis has been developed. Furthermore, a process for protein recovery was recently developed by applying a specific LAB starter culture to green juice from freshly harvested crops. This paper focuses on reviewing LAB for their applications within biorefining of ?green? crops such as clover, alfalfa, grasses and other green plant materials.},

        abstract = {The Nafferton factorial systems comparison (NFSC) experiments facilitate the investigation of effects of, and interaction between, three production system components - a) rotational position, b) fertility and c) crop protection management - in organic, conventional and low-input crop management systems. This paper presents first results on pesticide and growth regulator residues observed over a period of two years. Residues were only detected for three (Chlormequat, Chlorothalonil and Aldicarb) of the 28 pesticides used in the experiments. As expected, residue levels were affected by the crop protection practices, but significant effects of fertility management practices were also detected. This indicates that the human health risks associated with pesticide residues may increase in low input systems which attempt to reduce the environmental impact of conventional farming systems by switching to organic matter based fertilisation regimes.},

The multifunctional use of trees for energy production, nutrient cycling, carbon storage, biodiversity, landscape and -last but not least- fodder could make trees a third crop next to grass and maize on dairy farms. To decide which trees to use for planting, it is important to have also insight into the feeding value of the different tree leave species. Therefore a database has been created on the basis of available literature on feeding values of leaves and twigs. Compared to grass, the in-vitro Organic Matter Digestibility of tree leaves is relatively low. However, crude protein and mineral levels of some species are relatively high, which shows the potential value of tree leaves as an additional feed source.},

Green waste was the most popular fertilizer product, accepted by more than 90\% of the respondents. Least popular was conventional manure from fur animals, but even for this material, more than 30\% of the stakeholders were willing to accept its use in OA. There is a large interest among organic stakeholders in fertilizer products derived from human excreta, provided these can be controlled to be safe with respect to food safety issues (pathogens, pharmaceuticals, heavy metals and other pollutants). More than 60\% of the respondents accepted the use of human urine and sewage sludge in OA. The results of this study indicate that organic stakeholders are ready to accept more recycled P fertilizers into OA, as long as means are taken to ensure sufficient purity, safety and environmental efficiency of such products. This calls for adaptations in the regulations for authorization of fertilizers and soil amendments to certified organic production.}

        abstract = {In controlled indoor experiments, and a field experiment at Tingvoll farm in 2016, we studied the effect of mixing finely ground calcium carbonate made from marble into animal manure slurries, and digestates. In field, 6\% higher yields of dry matter were achieved at the second harvest by such addition to the manure. For the first harvest, no effects were found of marble application. This may be due to the manure being stored for a longer time for the application in spring, whereas manure applied after the first harvest was freshly collected.
In open containers, slurry from pigs and dairy cows, digested dairy cow slurry and digestate from a biogas plant (Ecopro) treating sewage sludge, household waste and fish waste was studied. Substrates with or without addition of marble were analyzed before and after 6 weeks of storage at about 12 ?C with weekly stirring. In the digestate from Ecopro, pH decreased by marble addition. For the other substrates, the effect on pH was small and inconsistent. The reduction of the ammonium and total nitrogen (N) contents or concentrations (\% of dry matter) in containers during storage did not differ between with and without marble addition. Hence, marble application did not reduce N emissions in this study. The N loss was significant. It could be interesting to conduct a further study with conditions more comparable to a practical situation. The marble was not mixed with dispersion agent in the present study.
Finely ground marble is still a valuable soil amendment, to maintain or increase soil pH and apply valuable nutrients to the soil. Mixing the marble into animal manure or digestate is a convenient way of applying it to agricultural soil.}

However, the growing demand for food in the coming years and decades requires the use of increasingly productive and efficient agriculture. Several studies carried out in recent years have shown how the application of plant growth-promoting microbes (PGPMs) can be a valid substitute for chemical industry products and represent a valid eco-friendly alternative. However, because of the complexity of interactions created with the numerous biotic and abiotic factors (i.e., environment, soil, interactions between microorganisms, etc.), the different formulates often show variable effects. In this review, we analyze the main factors that influence the effectiveness of PGPM applications and some of the applications that make them a useful tool for agroecological transition.},

           title = {Exploitation of natural resources to increase soil health: BIO-INCROP, a project on organic fruit tree cropping systems},
        abstract = {Introduction
The vast majority of apple production in Europe takes place in intensive orchards, this implies the need for intensive capital investment for support structures which then have to be used for a number of generations of trees. Consequently new orchards have to be replanted in the same place as previous plots. This causes soil sickness or yield decline of which ?replant disease? is the main biological component. Resulting yield losses are difficult to assess; a recent study in South Tyrol, where 12\% of total EU apple is produced, showed that growth reduction can vary from 20 to 60\% in replanted orchard compared to fallow control. Severity of this etiology is mediated by plant vigour, physiological state of plants and abiotic factors. Therefore, its occurrence is actually an indicator for fruit growers of the degraded status of biological soil processes. The only effective strategy to control replant disease and crop decline in organic fruit tree orchards is to increase soil diversity, and consequently, the various microbial processes involved in controlling soil borne pathogens, enhancing root growth and mediating plant nutrition.

Methods
BIO-INCROP, an European transnational project on organic farming, aims to increase knowledge about agro-management practices based on the study of microbial factors involved in soil suppressiveness and biological soil fertility. Project activities are planned on two reference crops: apple and citrus, which represent two main European agro-environments: apple growing areas of Central Europe (Switzerland, Germany, South Tyrol in Italy and Styria in Austria) and Mediterranean citrus growing areas (Valencia region in Spain and the East Mediterranean region of Turkey).
 
Research Actions of the project focus on exploitation of two main categories of natural resources in order to develop innovative cropping practices which will enable soil biodiversity preservation and exploit its biological features. They are: 
1. Biological resources indigenous to the orchard soil represented by microbial communities and wild plants of natural vegetative covers. 
2. Natural resources exogenous to the orchards; in particular, recycled organic materials and cover crops chosen from local germoplasm collections and wild plants.
Early evaluation of soil health based on plant response in greenhouse bioassay tests and culture-based and molecular methods for microbial response evaluation, are the integrated methodologies used to identify natural resources and techniques capable of increasing microbial biomass and diversity and selectively affecting beneficial and pathogenic microbial populations. Each country?s activities is planned in close cooperation with regional agricultural research centres working on organic farming and laboratories with specific expertise.

Expected results
The main objectives and expected results of the project are: 
1. To provide indicators of degradation status and risk for replant disease occurrence in the orchards.
2. To promote the use of indigenous or external resources for developing innovative management options aimed at i) selectively increasing the components of soil suppressiveness, ii) preserving and increasing soil microbial biomass and diversity.
3. To integrate the national guidelines for certified organic production with agro-management strategies based on eco-functional intensification of organic cropping systems.
4. To provide knowledge for supporting: i) critical adoption by farmers and local extension services of available organic amendments and bio-products ii) the development of soil management practices aimed at increasing soil suppressiveness according to available natural resources and environmental conditions.

However, there is only little information available on the situation in real life: is organic agriculture more welfare-friendly than its conventional counterpart?? Our systematic literature review showed that organic farming has potential to achieve good welfare states (e.g. regarding lameness). Moreover it may not be beneficial if it coincides with less than optimal management (e.g. regarding pasture parasites).  Outcome-based assessments should therefore be implemented in organic standards in order to consider and safeguard the health-related aspects of animal welfare.}

           month = {June},
        abstract = {This short report represents a summary of the analysis conducted so far on the GfK Panel Data. The focus was on the main three types of raw meat: chicken, pork, beef, as well as three categories of processed food products: liver paste, cold cuts and sausages. The aim was to look at the market indicators for each one of the six sub-categories, out of which market share and penetration were considered to be the most important. Besides these two indicators, I also included some extra calculations for each category, which can be analysed further and more in-depth if needed.
One of the desired outcomes of the analyses was to identify companies and brands that were successful in each sub-category. Unfortunately, due to the generally low market shares of the organic products, the number of options was limited. Beef and pork were two categories where no brands were registered in the original product and sales Files. In the chicken category there was only one brand registered between 2006 and 2010, however, the market shares were extremely low for this category. There were only one or two households buying organic chicken products. The processed meat sub-categories both had a few companies registered. However, the diversity isn?t large. Still, it is good to notice that in the three sub-categories there were two companies that were most present: Farre Food and Hanegal.
Market shares were generally low for all six sub-categories. Organic beef, pork and liver paste were the only categories to reach market shares of over 1\%, while organic chicken had the lowest market shares of all. The trends were generally fluctuating over time. The highest market shares for liver paste, pork, chicken and beef were registered in 2007. All these four categories had much lower market shares in 2009, but it is interesting to notice that in the same year, organic cold cuts and sausages registered the highest market shares. Except for chicken, all market shares dropped in 2010 compared to 2009.
Penetration levels had a clear descending trend for organic beef and liver paste, whereas for the other subcategories the levels fluctuated. Organic chicken and sausage generally had an ascending trend, while organic pork and cold cuts usually had descending trends in penetration levels. The highest penetration rates were registered in 2006 for liver paste, beef and cold cuts and in 2008 for sausages, chicken and pork. Out of all the six sub-categories that were analysed, organic beef has had the highest market shares and highest penetration rates, even though the figures were lower and lower every year.
Regarding the average price paid/100 gr of meat products, we notice that in the organic category there is more fluctuation than in the conventional category, meaning that the price of organic products varies more between years. According to the analysis, the price difference between the organic and the conventional options in a sub-category is clearly notices in the processed meat category, but it is not as well defined for chicken, pork and beef.
There are some limitations regarding the analysis of the panel data. On the one hand, these are due to the fact that there are some incompatibilities between the product file and the sales file regarding the identification of products as being organic or not. On the other hand, some of the products were registered as ?unknown?, meaning that they are neither analysed as being organic, nor as being conventional, but as being a separate category. It is considered however that due to the fact that the results of the analysis are so small, the correction of these errors would not change the numbers significantly.},

The setting is a theoretical model of a farm-cooperation of 10 farms of 100 ha each producing only milk and animals for slaughtering and being self-sufficient with fodder and fertilizer. The question is if they can be self-sufficient with energy by means of shared biogas and/ or bioethanol production facilities. The method is mapping of energy, emergy (embodied energy measured in solar energy joules) and mass flows in different scenarios, that are based on empirical data from Danish dairy farms concerning mix of crops, crop yields, livestock input/output and fuel and electricity consumption.
In various scenarios different utilization of the produced crop is tested. Biogas is produced from manure and either clover grass or maize, and the effluent is fed back to the fields as fertilizer. In another scenario bioethanol is produced from grain and whey originating from the dairy cheese production, and the effluent is fed back to the livestock as a protein-rich fodder. 
Results compare the different scenarios in terms of mass, energy and emergy flows, thus including direct and indirect energy. Overall resource and energy efficiency are evaluated.},

As the LI increases, environmental performances increase and economic performances are more resilient.

        abstract = {Multi-species livestock farming consists of keeping two or more animal species ? or more generally combining different animal production units ? on the same farm. It was often proposed as a solution towards higher sustainability of livestock farms but in practice although the proof of evidence was limited. This is why in MIX-ENABLE, our objective was to develop the knowledge base on organic multi-species livestock farms. To do so, we combined several approaches:
We synthesized potential benefits and limitations of multi-species livestock farming for farm sustainability from existing literature. We showed that multi-species livestock farming has the potential to improve the five dimensions of farm sustainability reviewed: resource-use efficiency and conservation, animal health and welfare, productivity, profitability and human welfare; as long as locally relevant farming practices are used, especially an appropriate stocking rate during grazing.
We conducted a desktop analysis of specialized and multi-species organic livestock farms. We compared 3 farm samples from France over the period 2000-2016: farms specialized in one ruminant species (219 farms), farms with two ruminant species (44 farms) and farms with ruminants and monogastrics (17 farms). We showed that multi-species farms, especially those combining ruminants and monogastrics, tend to have a higher and more stable income (in the range 506-532 ?/ha against 338-455 ?/ha with a coefficient of variation in the range 43-49\% against 59-80\%) but create higher N surplus (in the range 32-77 kg N/ha against -3-3 kg N/ha). Overall it showed that the theoretical benefits of multi-species livestock farming often reported in the literature are not systematic.
We surveyed 127 farms to collect data on key aspects of farm structure, crop, pasture and livestock management, raw material inflows and outflows, economics and social data (satisfaction of the farmer, workload). Data on strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats perceived by farmers were also collected to identify the levers and barriers to the development of organic multi-species livestock farming. After cleaning and verification, data on 102 farms were organized in a database from which we showed among other things that 6 out of 86 farms that outperform their peers (based on four indicators) despite having the same resources and constraints. They have very different sizes and enterprise combinations but all have a strong autonomy for feed and strong interactions among farm activities. They also very often practice direct sales and have set up a satisfactory work organization, both intra-farm and with local networks.
Using experimental trials, we showed that: (i) when sequentially grazing young dual-purpose steers with lambs, next to the well-established effects on lambs, no benefits but also no disadvantages for steers were observed, neither in terms of parasite egg excretion nor in daily weight gains; (ii) when co-grazing beef cattle batches and sheep flocks, mixing species seem to be profitable for sheep with no effects on cattle: all the lambs could be finished at pasture before winter whereas 10\% of the lambs from the solitaire sheep flock had to be finished indoor. Lambs and ewes in mixed flock also excreted less parasite eggs; and (iii) when rearing cattle and broilers on the same pasture, losses of broiler chickens due to predatory birds were reduced.
Farm simulation modelling were conducted over four French farms surveyed using Orfee, a bio-economic model that optimizes a function of net income under market and policy variability. Simulations showed that the risk associated with 70\% reduction of grassland yield was by far the highest. Three of the four farms had significant risk of negative income for the baseline situation. The reduction of stocking rate reduced variability of income in all cases, nonetheless it did not remove the probability to have very low income. The introduction of a pig enterprise and the replacement of beef with dairy did not much reduce the variability but increased income and consequently reduced farm vulnerability.

        abstract = {Diversified farming systems are proposed as a major mechanism to address the many sustainability issues of today's agriculture. Multi-species livestock farming, i.e. keeping two or more animal species simultaneously on the same farm, is an option that has received little attention to date. Moreover, most studies of multi-species livestock farming are limited, usually focusing on selected dimensions of farm sustainability and addressing lower organizational levels (i.e. within the farm) and rather limited time horizons (e.g. a few weeks in a grazing season). Thus, a comprehensive assessment of multi-species livestock farming in terms of farm sustainability is lacking. In this context, we outline and discuss potential benefits and limitations of multi-species livestock farming for livestock farm sustainability from existing literature and list issues on multi-species livestock farming requiring further research. We show that multi-species livestock farming has the potential to improve the three dimensions of sustainability reviewed - economic viability for farmers, environmental soundness and social acceptability by being respectful of animals and humans - as long as locally relevant farming practices are implemented, especially an appropriate stocking rate during grazing. If relevant practices are not observed, multi-species livestock farming may produce undesirable effects, such as competition for resource acquisition during grazing, parasitic cross-infection and more intense work peaks. Therefore, we identify four focal research areas for multi-species livestock farming. First, characterizing the management of multi-species livestock farms. To do this, we suggest considering the integration of production enterprises (e.g. cattle and sheep enterprises)
within the farm from three perspectives: farming practices (e.g. grazing management), work organization and sales. Second, exploring the complementarity of livestock species on multi-species livestock farms. This is especially true for species combinations that have been largely ignored (e.g. ruminants and monogastrics), even though they may have potential due to complementary diet compositions and resource-acquisition strategies. Third, assessing the sustainability of multi-species livestock farm scenarios (current or alternative) according to the management practices and production conditions, which requires adapting existing methods/models or developing new ones. Fourth, characterizing conditions for success and obstacles for multi-species livestock farming along the value chain from production to consumption, considering stakeholders' objectives, work habits and constraints. Increasing understanding should help prioritize actions and organize them to scale up multi-species livestock farming.}

        abstract = {1 ? Introduction 
Responding to the many sustainability issues related to modern industrial agriculture (air, soil and water pollution, biodiversity loss, etc.), the diversity argument was brought forward by scientists (Kremen et al., 2012). Diversified farming systems intentionally include functional agrobiodiversity, i.e. crops, seeded and permanent pastures, rangelands and animal genotypes and species chosen by the farmer to manage his farm. These systems presumably provide ecosystem services while reducing the input needed for production. Agrobiodiversity is also assumed to strengthen the robustness and resilience of livestock farming systems. 
Because of their inherent complexity, research on diversified farming systems is limited. Literature on the topic mainly consists of review articles that gather and integrate field- and herd-scale results at the farm level (Frison et al., 2011; Lin, 2011; Mijatovic et al., 2012) without addressing threshold effects driven by the scale change. Moreover, these articles largely focus on biotechnical issues and only take limited account of the socio-economic aspects of livestock farming (e.g. presence vs. absence of a local value chain) that contribute to the success or failure of diversified systems. The proof of concept thus seems rather limited so far. 
We need to increase our understanding of the potential benefits and challenges of diversified farming systems. We focus on organic multi-species livestock farms, i.e. livestock farms integrating two or more animal species, possibly with integrated crop production. We review the theoretical advantages of mixed livestock farming and conclude on how studying diversified farming systems challenges the concepts and methods that have long been used to design and analyze conventional livestock systems. 
2 ? Theoretical framework 
Sustainability in the context of organic multi-species livestock farms is understood as a multi-dimensional concept that involves trade-offs among the following dimensions: resource use efficiency, resource conservation, self-reliance, productivity, profitability, human welfare, animal welfare and resilience to hazards. In this paper, we review the literature according to these dimensions. 
3 ? Results ? Discussion 
The majority of papers studying multi-species livestock farming suggest that it improves productivity per animal and per unit area (d?Alexis et al., 2014). However, it is usually only one species that benefits from mixed grazing (e.g. lambs when grazed with cattle). Improved productivity is related to a higher resource use efficiency and to facilitation processes. Mixed grazing allows each species to express its food preferences and can enhance herbage use. For instance, sheep graze herbage close to cattle dungs that have high nutrient content and dry matter digestibility and is usually avoided by cattle (de Rancourt et al., 1980). In addition, multi-species farming systems may provide health benefits to the animals. It has been shown that mixed grazing of cattle and sheep reduces the number of strongyles well adapted for sheep (Arundel and Hamilton, 1975; Jordan et al., 1998) and thereby improve sheep performance and possibly sheep welfare. On the other hand, multi-species farming systems may increase the risks of transmission of bacterial and viral diseases, e.g. dermatitis (Rogdo et al., 2012). A special threat may arise from diseases with high mutation rates transmitted horizontally, e.g. among sheep and goats. Self-reliance is promoted when transfers of by-products occur from one farm enterprise to another and thereby avoid purchase of costly feed inputs. This is the case for piglets fed with whey from cattle, sheep or goat milk processing into cheese (Maswaure and Mandisodza, 1995). Despite these potential savings and above-mentioned benefits of multi-species livestock farms, their profitability is not necessarily higher than that of specialized farms. Economic results are, however, usually more stable thus improving farm resilience against economic or climatic hazards (Mischler, 2019). 
4 ? Conclusions 
Based on available literature, multi-species livestock farming appears as a promising option for improved sustainability in agriculture. However, this literature remains rather limited and we have identified two main knowledge gaps which may hinder the upscaling of multi-species livestock farming. First, multi-species livestock farms may be much more complex to manage thus increasing workload and making farmer welfare more critical, but this aspect has been little studied so far. Second, little information is available on how interactions among species (or farm enterprises) are managed, although these interactions appear to be key drivers of farm efficiency and resilience. 
Further research is thus needed to increase our knowledge of the technical, economic and environmental performances of multi-species livestock farms according to the management practices implemented. This research challenges the current concepts and methods of agricultural science that are mainly suited to specialized farms. Analytical frameworks to assess the integration among species or farm enterprises should better consider the farming practices but also how farm work is organized to deal with this diversity. Another key issue is how sales management does (or does not) take advantage of economies of scope allowed by the diversity of productions.},

Biomethane potential batch tests and inhibition studies of brown juice were performed during continuous processing in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor. Prolongation of the lag phase in the batch tests with increasing substrate/inoculum ratio suggested initial inhibition, which was, however, overcome by adaptation. This was indicated by high final methane yields, which were close to the theoretical maximum of up to 500 L-CH4 kg-VS?1, achieved after 15 days for most of the set-ups. Reactor operation at the organic loading rate of 13.9 g-COD L?1 day?1 and hydraulic retention time of 3 days revealed methane yields of 202 L-CH4 kg-COD?1 (307 L-CH4 kg-VS?1). Particle size analysis of the granules used in the reactor showed disintegration of the larger granules.}

Die Bewertung beruht auf einer Betriebsbesichtigung und einem etwa zwei- bis dreist{\"u}ndigen Interview mit den Betriebsleitern zu verschiedenen f{\"u}r die Landwirtschaft relevanten Themenbereichen. Innerhalb von drei Jahren wurden so 185 H{\"o}fe auf ihre Nachhaltigkeit hin untersucht. Die Stichprobe wurde so gew{\"a}hlt, dass alle Betriebstypen und Landwirtschaftszonen abgebildet wurden.
Zu den Projektzielen geh{\"o}rten:
- Repr{\"a}sentative Bewertung der Nachhaltigkeitsleistungen der Knospe-Betriebe durch eine externe Institution.
- Erm{\"o}glichung der kontinuierlichen Entwicklung der Betriebe und Sicherstellung der Zukunftsf{\"a}higkeit der Bio Suisse Betriebe sowie der Marke Knospe.
- Erarbeitung einer glaubw{\"u}rdigen Informationsbasis zur Kommunikation der Nachhaltigkeit von Knospe-Betrieben.

        abstract = {In organic agriculture, soil fertility is essential for harvesting high quality crop yields. Plant nutrient cycles should be kept short and as closed as possible. Therefore, it is important to have sustainable growing systems that have rotations with appropriate crops and cover crops. In organic farming green manures and cattle manure are also used to ensure fertile and biologically active soil and to enhance biodiversity. Green manures offer supporting services, such as nutrient cycling, promotion of beneficial insects for pest control and soil formation. Also the catch crops on winter period are essential to reduce nutrient leaching (Stark and Porter, 2005). 
Growing system does not only influence the soil fertility, but through that also the quality parameters of crops (Olesen et al, 2009; M{\"a}der et al, 2002). In recent years food metabolomics has been used as a novel method for `fingerprinting` or for ?profiling? food samples (Haj{\v s}lova et al, 2011). `Fingerprinting` of food samples enables to perform comparative analyses aimed at detection of differences. ?Profiling? is used for identification individual, differential sample components (both primary and secondary metabolites). Production system and interaction among the microbial population are important factors that also affect food safety and shelf life (Guerzoni et al., 1996). Among the microorganisms, some moulds, yeasts, bacteria, and viruses have both desirable and undesirable roles in our food. Most bacteria, moulds, and yeasts, because of their ability to grow in foods, can potentially cause food spoilage, however mere microbial presence does not reduce the quality of food, except in the case of some pathogens (Ray, 2005).
The aim of present study was to investigate the influence of green manures as intercrops and these combined with composted cattle manure on microbiological quality and metabolomic fingerprinting of winter wheat in a crop rotation experiment in three organic systems at the Estonian University of Life Sciences in 2012.

A new biocontrol method using the nematophagous fungus Duddingtonia flagrans is expected to complement existing alternatives for controlling gastrointestinal nematodes in grazing animals in the future. Animals receive chlamydospores of D. flagrans, which pass through the gastrointestinal tract and germinate in the freshly deposited faeces. In parallel to the development of helminth larvae, the fungal mycelium grows and forms trapping structures with which it fixes, kills and ""digests"" the nematode larvae. This leads to reduced pasture contamination and infection of subsequently grazing animals.In an experiment with organic dairy goats, a dose-dependent effect of D. flagrans administration was shown. Compared to horses, cattle and sheep, higher doses were required to obtain 70\% reduction of helminth larval development in faecal cultures of goats."},

Results indicated that manure significantly affected grain yield (P{$\leq$}0.01); the highest grain yield was achieved in the interaction of manure {$\times$} Azotobacter {$\times$} Pseudomonas (4.556 ton/ha). Grain yield was not significantly affected by the microorganisms. Moreover, the four factors of the experiment significantly affected auxin, gibberellin and cytokinin content of plant. Overall, this experiment indicated that desirable yield can be achieved by the application of manure and biofertilizers, in a sustainable  agriculture. },

It is against this background that this study was carried out to determine the perception of the effectiveness of indigenous and organic maize pest management practices among maize farmers in Oyo state in order to bridge the gap between the old and new technology and determine the relationship that will enhance the development of ecological organic agriculture (EAO). A well structured interview schedule was used to solicit for information from the 150 respondents using a systematic sampling technique. Frequency, percentage, Chi-square and Pearson Product Moment Correlation (PPMC) were used to describe and analyze the data generated. The farmers? level of awareness on indigenous and organic maize pests management practices was high at (58\%) level and the respondents level of utilization was also high at (61.3\%) level, with a favourable perception about the effectiveness of indigenous and organic maize pests management practices and some of these practices are; cultural practices through the use of hoes and cutlasses, the use of traps, practice of bush fallow, early planting, crop rotation, mixed cropping system and biological pest control. Furthermore, Pearson Product Moment Correlation(PPMC) results showed that there is no significant relationship between some selected socio- economic characteristics age (r =0.091, p=0.270), year of formal education (r =0.010, p=0.903), farming experience ( r =0.128, p =0.120), family size (r =0.072, p=0.380), average income per month (r =0.056, p= 0.499) and the perception of the effectiveness of indigenous and organic maize pest management practices in the study area. The results of the study revealed that farmers? level of awareness and utilization of indigenous and organic maize pest management practices was high and this is good for sustainable development EOA. The farmers perceive indigenous knowledge and organic system to mean the same and better option for against conventional farming system. Improvement of information on indigenous best practices to merge with EOA system for maize pest management through adequate extension services is eminent to enhance sustainable health of food and farmers.}

The environmental injustice inherent in conventional pests management practices are perpetrated mainly through widespread exposure to chemicals used in agricultural production. The overall ill effect of this chemical based product to the environment and human health are some of the challenges which called for attention to look for efficient and effective alternatives that are capable of replacing chemical pesticides in agricultural production. Therefore, the research determined the perception of vegetable farmers on neem extract and rate of use for the control of insect.  The respondents? level of knowledge on neem extract was high (84.9\%), benefits derived from utilization of neem extract such as prevention of pest and diseases ranked highest (95.7\%) and the constraint associated with the utilization of neem extract was also high (50.5\%). Chi square test of relationship revealed that there was significant relationship between socio economic characteristics such as: Age ({\ensuremath{\chi}}2= 26.668, p= 0.009), level of education ({\ensuremath{\chi}}2 = 66.351, p = 0.007), Income ({\ensuremath{\chi}}2 =27.443, r= 0.007), Major occupation ({\ensuremath{\chi}}2= 28.592, r= 0.005), and Farm size ({\ensuremath{\chi}}2=71.001, p= 0.000) and the vegetable farmers perception of neem extract. The study further revealed that respondents sources of information on neem extract (p= 0.001), benefits derived from application of neem extract (p= 0.029), and constraints associated with the utilization of neem extract (p= 0.000), had significant relationship with respondents? perception of neem extract. The respondents had favourable perception of neem extract for the control of insects. Therefore, to sustain farmers? interest in organic farming, the farmers should be motivated through training on application of neem extract and there should also be documentation of effectiveness and correct quantity of neem extract to use.},

        abstract = {O objetivo principal deste trabalho foi analisar aspectos do sistema de producao em propriedades agroecologicas em areas da reforma agraria na regiao do baixo Acre. Foram realizados trabalhos de: a) descricao do processo historico e o estado da arte da agroecologia na regiao do baixo Acre; b) analise do sistema de producao rural adotado por agricultores agroecologicos do baixo Acre; c) avaliacao dos aspectos sociais, economicos e de gestao em propriedades e; d) conhecer o consumo de produtos agroecologicos em Rio Branco-AC. O trabalho foi desenvolvido junto a 32 agricultores agroecologicos assentados pela reforma agraria, pertencente aos projetos de assentamento Benfica, Humaita e Moreno Maia, localizados na regiao do baixo Acre. No trabalho sobre o consumo de produtos agroecologicos foram entrevistados 103 consumidores da Feira Organica de Produtos Naturais de Rio Branco. As informa{\c c}{\~o}es foram obtidas a partir de dados secundarios e aplicacao de questionarios, referente ao periodo de 1997 a 2007. O movimento pela adocao da agroecologia no Acre foi iniciado por agricultores agroecologicos no inicio dos anos 90, sendo oficialmente implantado a partir de 1997, via esforco conjunto de entidades e instituicoes locais. Realizadas centenas de atividades de treinamento em agroecologia, atingindo cerca de 3310 pessoas, notadamente no baixo Acre. Observou-se a ocorrencia de diversos agroambientes nas areas de producao. Verificou-se alta riqueza em agrobiodiversidade vegetal, registrando-se ate 165 especies vegetais ocorrendo em quintais agroflorestais, avaliados e expressados pelos indices de biodiversidade de especies (1,2 a 3,2). Os agricultores adotam praticas agricolas agroecologicas no manejo agropecuario e florestal. A criacao da feira viabilizou o estabelecimento da agroecologia no baixo Acre, pela venda direta da producao agroecologica. A atividade para os produtores entrevistados e rentavel, sendo a unica fonte de renda de 35\% das familias. A inadimplencia entre os agricultores e baixa (18,5\%) mesmo com alta acessibilidade ao credito. Cerca de 72\% da producao agroecologica e comercializada diretamente na feira. As dificuldades na infra-estrutura de transporte limitam o escoamento da produ{\c c}{\~a}o e agravam os problemas de saude e educacao encontrados no campo. O setor da agroecologia no Acre cresceu 204\% em onze anos devido ao aumento da produtividade, numero de agricultores e consumidor. A pesquisa revelou que os consumidores de produtos agroecologicos sao bem informados sobre causas ambientais e origem dos produtos adquiridos, apresenta idade media (48 a 51), ambos os sexos, elevado nivel de escolaridade, confirma os produtos serem saudaveis e baratos alem de manter vinculo com o agricultor permitindo troca de experiencias. A producao, transporte e a comercializacao comunitaria de produtos caracterizam a existencia do arranjo produtivo local (APL) dos produtos agroecologicos do baixo Acre. A organizacao dos agricultores, a motivacao da sociedade e do governo em acreditar na possibilidade de oferta de alimentos de melhor qualidade para a populacao local s{\~a}o fatores essenciais para o avanco da agroecologia no Acre.}

        abstract = {Manure treatment such as anaerobic digestion and solid-liquid separation has shown a potential to abate
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but few studies have considered GHG emissions from both storage and field
application regarding crop yield. In this study, four different organic fertilizers were studied: untreated cattle
manure (CA); digestate of cattle manure anaerobically co-digested with grass-clover (DD); a liquid fraction from
the separation of DD (LF); and a liquid fraction derived from a biogas desulfurization biofilter enriched with
sulfur and ammonium (NS). The CH4, N2O and NH3 emissions during storage of CA, DD and LF between August
and November 2020 (11 weeks) were quantified. Storage continued until April 2021 when these materials, as
well as the NS fertilizer and a mineral NKS fertilizer, were applied at a rate of 100 kg total N/ ha to spring
barley. N2O emissions and soil mineral N content were monitored during the growing season. Overall, CH4
emissions during storage were the main source of GHG emissions independent of treatments, accounting for 85
\%, 40 \% and 11 \% of total GHG emissions (based on field application of 100 kg/ ha total N) from treatments CA,
DD and LF, respectively. Anaerobic digestion and separation significantly reduced CH4 emissions during storage
due to the diminished content of degradable organic matter available for methanogens. The N2O emissions from
treatments CA, DD, and LF during storage were not significantly different. Treatments DD and LF emitted more
NH3 than CA during storage, presumably because of higher pH and ammonium content. In the field experiment,
the dilute solution of NS emitted the most N2O, while emissions from treatments CA, DD and LF were comparable.
Yield-scaled GHG emissions for treatments CA, DD, LF and NS during both periods of storage and field
were 44.4, 17.1, 8.5 and 24.3 kg CO2 eq/ hkg grain yield, respectively. Anaerobic digestion with or without
separation were thus effective strategies for the mitigation of GHG emissions from cattle manure in this study.
Yields and nitrogen use efficiencies of the processed manure materials were not significantly different from those
observed with the same N application rate as inorganic fertilizer, and hence anaerobic digestion with or without
separation were promising GHG mitigation strategies},

Here, large-scale untargeted LC-MS-based metabolomics was used to compare the composition of white cabbage from organic and conventional agriculture, measuring 1,600 compounds. Cabbage was sampled in 2 years from one conventional and two organic farming systems in a rigidly controlled long-term field trial in Denmark. Using Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structures-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA), we found that the production system leaves a significant (p = 0.013) imprint in the white cabbage metabolome that is retained between production years. We externally validated this finding by predicting the production system of samples from one year using a classification model built on samples from the other year, with a correct classification in 83\% of cases. Thus, it was concluded that the investigated conventional and organic management practices have a systematic impact on the metabolome of white cabbage. This emphasizes the potential of untargeted metabolomics for authenticity testing of organic plant products.},

        abstract = {It is clear that the industrialised food system is in need of a transformation into something less environmentally and socially destructive and less vulnerable to scarcity of non-renewable resources. While there are alternatives, there are very few examples of alternative/organic/localised/civic food systems that have been able to grow out of their niche and make a substantial difference. The examples that are available can tell us a lot about what it takes to create new models within the hegemonic food system and about what is needed for such food chains to develop and maintain momentum. 
Using some key notions in resilience thinking, this paper explores the adaptive capacity of organic food value chains from 10 European countries that have been able to grow trying not to compromise their integrity and values. Adaptive capacity in this context is the ability of food system actors to manage their food value chain as to enhance desired resilience. Key aspects of adaptive capacity that are often mentioned are diversity, trust, social networks and learning. 
While all cases have different trajectories and are embedded in different national contexts they have experienced challenges with which they have dealt more or less effectively, drawing on their adaptive capacity. For example, mid-scale organic value chain initiatives that use diversity as a strategy (products, involved actors, knowledge etc.), that work to establish long-term partnerships and that enhance learning potential are more likely to embark on a trajectory that builds resilience.},

However, agricultural plants environment in the organic field characterized by physical, chemical and biological properties which different from intensive farming options. These conditions should be reflected in the selection of appropriate technological operations, which in turn fit into certain limitations.
Research on the adaptation of the basic crop cultivation technologies to the requirements of organic production is carried out in IAEP.For that purpose we developed a model of perspective technical and technological provision of organic farmers. The model considers a set of organic crop rotation, and for each crop of which the corresponding organic technology used. Technical means are selected from the general list contained in the model, depending on the size of the farm and the selected level of crop productivity. Economic and environment indicators are also calculated.
Particular attention of the model is drawn to the following group operations: mechanical tillage, application of organic fertilizers, weed and pest control.
Generally, organic farmers use ordinary technical means, but the model also considers promising.
We use tillage system with different depths for organic crop rotation: cereal crops -  at depth of 12 - 16 cm, for vegetable crops and potatoes at depth of 22 - 24 cm by mould board plough. In the presence of strongly marked "subsoil layer" or waterproof horizon the subsoil shattering is conducted to a depth of 45 cm by chisel cultivator. Fall tillage is an effective way to control weeds, diseases and pests.
Promising is the use of technical means for the local application of solid manure in the furrow.
A particularly important task in organic agriculture is weed control. In addition to crop rotation, the cultivation of root crops used ridge system and previously developed and then half-forgotten, rotary harrows to handle the ridge slopes during the growing season. Such rotary harrows were very effective for weed control in potatoes field experiment in 2016.   
Following operations: seeds cover by biological drugs; biological drugs application during seeding and on plants during vegetations, are including in technologies for organic control of deceases and pests.  
As a promising area is consider to use one of the physical methods for the precise removal of weeds. Also, the idea of precision agriculture can be used for imaging of a disease or pest on vegetation and accurate extermination on the small patch by biological drugs.
The model of promising technical and technological provision of organic farm can be transformed into a software system that will be useful for agricultural producers engaged in organic crop production, as well as organizations providing their technical means.},

On 1 January 2018, the OK-Net EcoFeed project started. OK-Net EcoFeed continues the work of the platform and will further improve and expand it with several new features (e.g.: events calendar, news sections) and a new theme ?Animal Husbandry?. The platform got a new design and a more user-friendly look.
The development and maintenance of the platform is the responsibility of FiBL, but all the partners of OK-Net EcoFeed will contribute.
All the collected knowledge and materials within the OK-Net EcoFeed project will be uploaded to the platform.
The new version of the platform (even if its online since 19 Dec 2018) will be launched on 15 February 2019 on the world?s biggest organic trade fair, Biofach (Nuremberg, Germany). At that occasion a press release will be sent out. IFOAM EU will send it to European media. Other partners will send a translated version to their national media.},

It contains several elements that are supportive of organic farming and agroecological innovation. The organic sector, with its history of strong collaboration across disciplines and between researchers and producers, should take advantage of the opportunities the EIP-AGRI offers.
This dossier is there to help the organic sector and the agroecological community understand the implementation of the EIP-AGRI. After a general introduction to the EIP-AGRI in the first chapter, the concepts behind the new approach to innovation are explained. The third chapter addresses the EIP-AGRI activities at EU level. An important part of the work will have to be done, however, by the rural development programmes at the national or regional levels. This is explained in the fourth chapter. Whilst each Member State will take its own approach, the EIP-AGRI is all about learning from each other. Therefore, the fifth chapter describes a number of interesting initiatives in the Member States. The dossier ends with an overview of the wide range of innovations with which the organic sector can contribute to the EIP-AGRI.}

        abstract = {The environmental impact is one of the major pillars of concerns when addressing the sustainability of food production and sustainable food consumption strategies. 
To assess to what extent food production affects the environment, one needs to choose a proper environmental assessment tool. Different types of assessment tools have been developed to establish environmental indicators, which can be used to determine the environmental impact of livestock production systems or agricultural products. The environmen?tal assessment tools can be divided into the area based or product based (Halberg et al., 2005). Area-based indicators are, for example, nitrate leached per hectare from a pig farm, and product-based indicators are, for example, global warming potential per kg pork (Dalgaard, 2007).
The area-based indicators are useful for evaluating farm emissions of nutrients such as nitrate that has an effect on the local environment. On the other hand, when considering the greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural production, the product-based indicators are useful for evaluating the impact of food productions on the global environment (e. g., climate change) and have the advantage that in addition to emis-sions from the farms, emissions related to the production of input s (e.g., soybean and artificial fertilizer) and outputs (e.g., slurry exported to other farms) are also included. In that way it is easier to avoid pollution swapping, which means that the solving of one pollution problem creates a new (Dalgaard, 2007).

        abstract = {On five organic dairy farms there was a positive effect of a high vitamin content in the home-grown roughage on the vitamin content of the milk produced. 
Vitamins and minerals are of crucial importance for the health and performance of the animals, and they also affect the nutritional value of the products. The highest concentrations of pro-vitamin A (in the form of beta-carotene) and vitamin E (alfa-tocopherol) are found in grass, legumes and other green plants, while seeds and whole-crop silage only contain small amounts of vitamins. While the requirements for for fat-soluble vitamins of grazing cattle are normally met via their intake from pasture, the supply of fat-soluble vitamins may decrease to very low amounts when conserved herbage is used instead of pasture. 
The DARCOF III project EcoVit involved five private organic dairy farms. On these farms the two most important types of roughage were monitored from harvest in 2007 and until the roughage was fed to cattle. Seven times during this period (every six weeks) a sample was collected from each of the two types of roughage and from the milk tank, and analysed for the concentrations of pro-vitamin A (in the form of beta-carotene) and vitamin E (alfa-tocopherol). At the same time the feed intake per cow per day was registered at herd level, including the supplement from a vitamin mixture, if any. This registration enabled cow total daily intake of vitamins from feed and supplements to be calculated. The two most important types of roughage in which the vitamin content was analysed constituted 90-100\% of the roughage fed to cattle. For the remaining part of the roughage and the concentrated feed, table values were used for the vitamin content. The vitamin content in the vitamin mixture was assumed to be the guaranteed amount.
We found a positive effect of a high vitamin content in the home-grown roughage, and thus ration, on the vitamin content in the produced milk. This article focuses on the vitamin E supply from roughage and its concentration in milk on two of the case study farm ? the farms with respectively the highest and the lowest concentration of vitamin E in roughage and milk.

It is broadly accepted by professionals within the dairy sector as a necessity for producing milk for human consumption and justified by the severe reaction of both cow and calf if separation occurs later than 24 hours after calving. The practice of early separation conflicts with the organic principles and is increasingly questioned by consumers, who argue for the development of a dairy production system that supports rearing of cows together with their own calves for an extended time. The main objective of this project is to develop strategies for mother-bonded rearing systems under different Danish organic farming conditions and quantify their effects on farm productivity and economics through analyses of existing dairy cow-calf systems and published experiments. The first step includes a systematic collection of farm data and system descriptions from existing cow-calf systems with focus on housing, management and outcomes of production. Our data collection so far shows that mother-bonded rearing of dairy calves is practiced in a variety of ways with herd size from 30 to 85 cows and milk production delivered to the dairy between 4,000 and 9,500 kg/cow/year. Calves stayed with the dam either full time, part time or full time in the beginning with diminishing time together towards weaning, which led calves to drink between 6-7 l/day and up to 14-16 l/day. Farmers either housed calves and all lactating cows in one group or housed lactating cows with or without calves in two separate groups. Farms used both deep litter and cubicle systems as well as both parlour and robotic milking systems. Finally, calves were either weaned and separated gradually with multiple steps or abrupt at once. The next step will be a synthesis of collected farm data, system descriptions and literature, which will go into developing different strategies for mother-bonded calf rearing in collaboration with Danish organic farmers.},

Thus, forcing the organic farmers to import feed and manure forom conventional farms. The main idea of the OrganoFinery project is to develop a green biorefinery concept where the same organic crop is utilizsed for animal feed, fertilizser and energy production in the form of methane, coping in this way with those challenges.
One of the aims of the project includes the identification of crops that can be grown on organic arable farms, where there is generally a significant lack of nitrogen. Particularly legumes are interesting as they can biologically fix N, producing large amounts of protein without the addition of N fertilizer. Red clover, clover grass, alfalfa and oil seed radish are being studied. 
Right after the harvest, the biomasses are separated in a green juice and a press cake using a screw press. Organic protein feed is produced by lactic acid fermentation of the green juice. The extraction of proteins is based on an already developed technique to extract proteins from alfalfa. The method for separation of proteins from alfalfa was developed by AAUs subcontractor Biotest Aps in a joint Biorefinery program (F{\O}SU grant 2101-08-0041). After the fermentation, two fractions are obtained: 1) the protein paste, with non-denatured proteins suited for development of a protein feed additive for poultry and 2) the brown juice, which is studied together with the press cake as a substrate for anaerobic digestion. Moreover, the digestate obtained after the anaerobic digestion is evaluated as organic fertilizser for the crops.
The protein yields obtained during the separation-fermentation process are in the range of 7 kg of crude protein from one tonne of fresh biomass. Crude protein contents up to 45 \% DM are obtained in the protein pastes. Furthermore, the amino acid composition showed more favourable composition than the traditional soy protein for poultry feed.

        abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present and discuss a new approach to assess a city's supply with food from the nearby region: the city food flow analysis. In view of the growing challenges of the global food system, the local level has increasingly been identified{--}both by citizen-consumers and city administrations{--}as a relevant scale to develop sustainable alternatives. Although different actors often agree on the aim to increase local food supply, the discussions and initiatives convey the lack of knowledge and data about the actual origin of food supplied to cities. Without knowing where food comes from and through which channels it reaches the consumer, it is difficult to develop alternatives that could eventually change the food system. This paper presents and discusses the city food flow analysis as a methodology to close this lack of information. It consists of a four-step approach that leads to a clear picture on the local food production around a city, the consumption of local food in a city and the importance of different supply chains for local food in the city, including retail and gastronomy. The methodology is illustrated with the example of two cases (cities). The city food flow analysis provides detailed information about the current situation of urban food provisioning, which city stakeholders can use to start an informed discussion process about necessary changes in the food system, re-embedding of cities into their territorial context. However, data are not always fully available, which is a result in itself that illustrates the challenges of re-localizing local food provisioning.},

IAT and ORFEE models for simulating mixed livestock farms},
        abstract = {Climate change and depletion of natural resources calls for a more sober and carbon neutral agriculture. Farmers are also challenged by climate change with more frequent and severe droughts and heat waves in an economic context often difficult. Mixed farming systems are gaining interest both as a risk management strategy and to apply agroecological principles. Diversity in organic farming systems is particularly important since those farms have limited access to external inputs and more frequently use direct marketing. According to Dumont et al. (2020), diversity of system components and interactions among these components can increase productivity, resource-use efficiency and farm resilience. The complementarities between livestock and crops offer levers to close local nutrient cycles, reduce GHG emissions intensities and increase carbon storage. The complementarity between two animal species appears as a promising leverage to use more efficient plant resources and to stabilize farm performance  which has been little studied until now (Martin et al. 2020). In the MixEnable projet, we want to analyse how organic mixed livestock farming systems are resilient and sustainable and how their farming systems could be adapted to reduce their vulnerability. 
Modelling offers a comprehensive way to understand complex farms in which exogenous and endogenous factors affect farm sustainability and robustness. Compared with real farm data analysis, modelling offers the possibility to do virtual experiments to test and compare strategies under modified climate or economic conditions and to disentangle the processes involved. Few farm models target organic systems (Olesen et al. 2006; Kerselaers et al. 2007) or offer the possibility to simulate different livestock species (Kerselaers et al. 2007; Lengers et al. 2014) and none of them provide enough flexibility to explore the variety of management options in a mixed livestock farm. Two existing models (Lisson et al. 2010; Mosnier et al. 2017a) have useful characteristics and could be further developed for modelling organic mixed livestock farms. The IAT model (Lisson et al. 2010) was developed to be used in a participatory way with smallholder crop-livestock farmers. The model of Mosnier et al. (2017) is more detailed, and better suited to desktop analysis. In the deliverable, we first compare the main attribute of each model relative to the needs of the project and then present the main developments made in Orfee that has been eventually used in MixEnable.},

Mutual comparison of organic farming in the Czech Republic with organic farming in Austria and actual conditions assessment provide to determine main problems of organic farming in both countries.
Within the framework of analysis of organic farming several general problems of organic farming in both countries were defined, e. g. lower yields and higher costs per production unit or legislative restrictions. At the same time for the Czech republic were defined major problems related to agricultural and socioekonomic differences (e. g. dual characteristics of farm size, high share of imported bioproduction) and for Austria (high prices of bioproducts, lower rate of conversion to organic farming) and proposed suitable solutions based on experience of partnership country. If the number of partnership countries with differentially developed organic farming was broaden and there was defined common problems and aims for organic farming in general it might be a very important step for simplification and acceleration of its development.},

Active state support of farming focused on the extensive production and maintenance of the countryside and the other environmental services is the crucial point of a successful development of competitive and economical (from the point of view of the environment) production in LFA. Organic farming is carried out on the area of 6 \% of the surface of agricultural land, most of agricultural land is worked with conventional methods of farming. In the Czech Republic there are significant differences between structure of the organic and conventional farming, especially in the share of arable land and share of permanent grasslands. The differences between organic and conventional farming systems can be located also in structure of production and in some other parameters (average acreage of the farms?). The contemporary state of farming has been evaluated and organic and conventional farming systems have been compared in the framework of the analysis of structure of farming in the Czech Republic. The selective group of 437 associations was divided into three different subgroups, and into several categories according to the farming method and altitude. Parameters of plant and animal production and use of the agroenvironmental programmes and measures are evaluated. The evaluation of the structure of farming permits to find optimal possibilities of future development of conventional and organic farming in the Czech Republic and of arrangements of the settings of grants and subsidies.},

In den letzten Jahren wurden zahlreiche Initiativen mit dem Ziel ins Leben gerufen, Fairness st{\"a}rker in den Gesch{\"a}ftsbeziehungen eines wachsenden Bio-Marktes zu verankern (u.a. Bio-Fair-Verein; Naturland Fair; Bio Fair Regio).
Bio Suisse verabschiedete im Jahr 2012 einen verbindlichen Verhaltenskodex zu fairen Handelsbeziehungen, initiierte auf die Gesch{\"a}ftsbeziehungen fokussierte Branchegespr{\"a}chsrunden und richtete in diesem Jahr eine Ombudsstelle zur Schlichtung von ggf. unter Marktpartnern auftretenden Konflikten ein. In diesem Zusammenhang wurde 2012 in einer ersten umfassenden empirischen Erhebung (M{\"u}hlrath et al. 2013) ein Stimmungsbild unter Schweizer Bio-Landwirten und deren Abnehmern erhoben. Hier wurde au{\ss}erdem in Anlehnung an den von Colquitt (2001) ma{\ss}geblich gepr{\"a}gten Organizational Justice Ansatz ein Messinstrument zur Analyse von Fairness in landwirtschaftlichen Abnehmer-Lieferantenbeziehungen entwickelt. Daraus wurde anschlie{\ss}end ein auf die konkrete Initiative der Bio Suisse zugeschnittener Erhebungsanasatz abgeleitet, der als begleitende empirische Untersuchung in regelm{\"a}{\ss}igen Abst{\"a}nden durchgef{\"u}hrt werden soll.
In diesem Beitrag wird der Frage nachgegangen, inwieweit sich standardisierte Befragungen zur Begleitung eines kontinuierlichen Weiterentwicklungsprozesses von Fairnessinitiativen eignen, die auf einem vertrauensbasierten Verhaltenskodex basieren. Au{\ss}erdem wird im Zeitablauf vergleichend beleuchtet, inwieweit die Handelspartner im Schweizer Bio-Markt mit ihren Gesch{\"a}ftsbeziehungen zufrieden sind und wie sie die Umsetzung der Aspekte des Verhaltenskodex durch die Marktpartner wahrnehmen.},

        abstract = {Sustainable soil management requires that the structural degradation is balanced or exceeded by regeneration. Our objective was to investigate the vulnerability of topsoil structure to stress exerted by intensive tillage or traffic. The study addressed the short-term stability to disturbance as well as the recovery (resilience) within a year. A field experiment was conducted in a randomized block design on a humid sandy loam in 1997-1999. Each year, either compaction from a heavy tractor (PAC) or puddling by intensive rotary cultivation (PUD) produced a severe impact on topsoil structure. The PAC and PUD treatments were carried out on wet soil in early spring. The mechanical treatments were referenced by plots (REF), which were left undisturbed until the soil had dried to a friable condition and ready for seedbed preparation. The PAC and PUD treatments were prepared for sowing at the same time as the reference plots. Penetration resistance was recorded in the spring of 1998 and 1999 to a depth of 200 mm. Soil was sampled from the 0-40 mm layer in May 1998 and in March, May and November 1999. The soil was air-dried and separated into four aggregate size fractions. The aggregates were subjected to tensile strength and density measurements. The penetration resistance in the 0-200 mm layer ranked in the order PAC{\ensuremath{>}}{\ensuremath{>}}PUD{\ensuremath{>}}REF. Both mechanical treatments significantly increased the density of 4-8 mm aggregates. One or two months after the mechanical treatments, they had increased tensile strength relative to REF by 44\% and 33\% in 1998 and by 13\% and 33\% in 1999 for the PAC and PUD treatments, respectively. Thus, our result showed substantial topsoil degradation when exposed to the PAC and PUD treatments, i.e. the sandy loam showed low stability. In November 1999, the PUD-treated aggregates were still markedly stronger than those found in the REF soil. Hence, the PUD-treated soil showed little resilience within a six-month summer period. There was no significant difference in aggregate tensile strength between the treatments in March 1999 after a winter with cycles of freezing and thawing and a mouldboard ploughing operation in early spring. Our results thus imply that soil degradation induced by soil compaction or intensive rotary cultivation early spring may reduce the ease of tillage in the following autumn whereas little residual effect can be expected in the following spring.}

Case Study 1 compared a diversely cropped organically farmed soil (DFG(1)) with a conventionally farmed soil predominantly growing annual crops (DFA), both receiving animal manure.  In Case Study 2, a diversely cropped organically managed soil DFG(2)) receiving animal manure was compared with an almost exclusively cereal cropped conventionally farmed soil receiving no animal manure (CCC). A multi-level experimental strategy was followed to compare integrating field methods with specialized laboratory methods. Ease of tillage was described in the field and characterized using a drop shatter field test and by measuring aggregate tensile strength. Fitness as a seedbed was characterised visually in the field and from the drop shatter test. Impedance to seedling emergence and root penetration was evaluated by measuring bulk soil shear strength. For Case Study 1, soil tilth was better for the DFA soil than for the DFG(1) soil (i.e. lower soil strength and higher ease of fragmentation and friability index for DFA). However, a crumbly structure and a moderate bulk density suggested that the DFG(1) soil was also a favourable medium for plant growth. For Case Study 2, the CCC soil had a lower organic matter content, higher bulk density, higher soil strength, and lower ease of fragmentation in comparison with the DFG(2) soil.},

Farm sizes were 9.3 {$\pm$} 6.7 acres in tethering system and 4.3 {$\pm$} 2.6 acres in zero-grazing. Fifty-four percent of the zero-grazing herds had animal housing facilities. All farmers in tethering system kept cows on earthen floors and calves without bedding. Hygiene level in existing farms was low. Majority of calves were fed once a day by restricted suckling (77 \%). Seventy-four percent of tethered cows were only fed on natural grass, while cows under zero-grazing system had a more diversified diet but with 82 \% feeding mainly Napier grass. Most farms (87 \%) used bulls for breeding. Milk production was higher (P {\ensuremath{<}} 0.05) in zero-grazing (6.5 L/cow/day) than tethering system, and higher (P {\ensuremath{<}} 0.05) for Holstein-Friesian crossbred cows (5.2 L/cow/day) than local breed cows (2.6 L/cow/day). Less than 1 L of milk per farm per day on average was sold. Disease treatments were exclusively for helminths, East Coast fever, and trypanasomiasis. Spraying of ticks and deworming were important control measures of vector-borne diseases. There is potential to develop alternative feed resources for dairy cattle and biorational pesticides for control and treatment of vector-borne diseases.},

        abstract = {In Kenya, there are more than 200,000 farmers who have been trained on organic farming technologies and systems. Currently certified land under organic management in Kenya stands at 104,211 ha while the organic sub sector employs 12,647 farmers who are directly involved in production of different organic products. Although there are many documented reasons that make farmers to adopt organic farming system, economic benefits present one of the major motivations. These benefits however are not well documented in Africa. The study was conducted to evaluate the determinants of adoption and profitability of smallholder organic vegetable production system in Kajiado and Kiambu counties of Kenya. It also aimed at evaluating the impact of organic production system on profitability of smallholder vegetable production systems in the two counties so as to appraise its contribution to improvement of rural livelihoods. The study collected data on costs, returns, social economic characteristics, farmer characteristics and market characteristics for a sample of 215 smallholder vegetable farmers who were composed of 71 organic and 144 conventional farmers. The whole population of smallholder organic farmers growing vegetables was sampled while conventional farmers sample was made up of clusters established using Stratified sampling method. A logit regression model was used to evaluate the factors affecting adoption of organic production system among smallholder vegetable farmers. Factors associated with profitability of smallholder organic production system were evaluated using an OLS regression model while the impact of organic production system was evaluated using propensity score matching. Organic vegetable production system was found to have a positive significant impact of increasing farm gross margin by 45.16\% among smallholder producers in Kiambu and Kajiado Counties of Kenya. The organic vegetable prices were found to be higher than conventional vegetable prices for all the vegetables. Additionally, organic production system was found to have higher production cost but higher gross margin as compared to conventional production system. Age, farming experience, irrigation, land ownership and County of residence were found to be associated with adoption of organic vegetable production system. Furthermore age, farming experience, number of trainings attended availability of irrigation, target market selected, production per acre, cost of production and price per unit had a bearing on the profitability of an organic smallholder vegetable farm. The study recommended wide adoption of organic production system as a tool to improve farm incomes of smallholder vegetable farmers in Kiambu and Kajiado counties of Kenya. Furthermore, the study recommended that organizations involved in promotion of organic farming in the two counties should design strategies that take cognizance of the important role of social economic, farm and market factors in determining profitability and adoption of smallholder organic vegetable production systems. The study concluded by recommending that further similar studies should incorporate the health and environmental benefits and the effect of conversion period while evaluating the economic benefits of organic production system.},

Baggrund og form{\r a}l
Foreliggende rapport belyser {\o}kologisk oksek{\o}dsproduktion baseret p{\r a} tyrekalve fra malkekv{\ae}gsbedrifter og best{\r a}r dels af en analyse af interview og sp{\o}rgeskemaunders{\o}gelse blandt {\o}kologiske landm{\ae}nd og dels af et litteraturstudie og modelberegninger. Tyrekalve fra {\o}kologiske malkekv{\ae}gsbedrifter s{\ae}lges ofte til konventionelle bedrifter, men indtil nu har der ikke foreligget  konkrete data om, hvor mange og hvorfor {\o}kologiske tyrekalve s{\ae}lges. Salget af {\o}kologiske tyrekalve kan anses som et etisk problem, idet {\o}kologisk jordbrug skal tilstr{\ae}be en produktion baseret p{\r a} et helhedssyn. Det overordnede form{\r a}l med rapporten er, at bidrage med viden omkring {\o}kologisk oksek{\o}dsproduktion baseret p{\r a} tyrekalve samt at belyse faktorer, der p{\r a}virker direkte og indirekte salget af tyrekalve fra de {\o}kologiske bes{\ae}tninger. Det er gjort ved at belyse, (1) i hvilket omfang {\o}kologiske tyrekalve s{\ae}lges fra bedriften og (2) at belyse faktorer, der for nuv{\ae}rende virker begr{\ae}nsende for produktionen af kalve, ungtyre og stude, herunder holdnings- og driftsm{\ae}ssige faktorer. For at belyse perspektiverne for at fremme {\o}kologisk oksek{\o}dsproduktion baseret p{\r a} tyrekalve er det desuden form{\r a}let med rapporten (3) at analysere drifts- og markedsm{\ae}ssige forhold af oksek{\o}dsproduktion i praksis samt udfra modeller suppleret med et omfattende litteraturstudie af udvalgte produktionsm{\ae}ssige forhold.

Metode
10 {\o}kologiske m{\ae}lkeproducenter deltog i en interviewunders{\o}gelse (februar 1999), og en sp{\o}rgeskemaunders{\o}gelse omfattede alle {\o}kologiske m{\ae}lkeproducenter i Danmark (n=671) samt 168 {\o}kologiske planteavlere (oktober 1999). 394 skemaer blev returneret (svarprocent: 48\%). Interviewet og sp{\o}rgeskemaet omfattede generelle bedriftsoplysninger, holdningssp{\o}rgsm{\r a}l vedr{\o}rende salget af tyrekalvene samt sp{\o}rgsm{\r a}l om produktionen af slagtekalve, ungtyre og/eller stude. P{\r a} baggrund af litteraturen er der opstillet modeller for {\o}kologisk studeproduktion baseret p{\r a} afgr{\ae}sning p{\r a} hhv. kl{\o}vergr{\ae}s og vedvarende gr{\ae}s og relevante problemstillinger som afgr{\ae}sningsstrategi, kastration og slutfedning er diskuteret. Modeller anvendes til en beregning af d{\ae}kningsbidraget af {\o}kologisk stude- og ungtyreproduktion p{\r a} 6 malkekv{\ae}gsbes{\ae}tninger, som inkluderer bedriftsdata vedr{\o}rende bl.a. foderomkostninger (kapitel 3).

Status over salget af tyrekalve
Resultaterne fra sp{\o}rgeskemaunders{\o}gelsen viser, at 71\% af de {\o}kologiske m{\ae}lkeproducenter enten s{\ae}lger alle tyrekalve til videre opfedning eller afliver kalvene mens 29\% opfeder nogle eller alle tyrekalve p{\r a} deres bedrift. Opgjort i antal kalve s{\ae}lges 66\% af alle {\o}kologiske tyrekalve til konventionelle bedrifter, 6\% s{\ae}lges til andre {\o}kologiske bedrifter,  8\% aflives og 20\% opfedes p{\r a} {\o}kologiske m{\ae}lkebedrifter. Tyrekalvene blev typisk solgt til konventionel opfedning ved en alder p{\r a} 5 uger og i en alder af 12 uger s{\ae}lges de til {\o}kologisk opfedning. De prim{\ae}re {\r a}rsager til salget af tyrekalvene er manglende staldplads, forventet d{\r a}rlig {\o}konomi i {\o}kologisk oksek{\o}dsproduktion samt mangel p{\r a} eget foder, men 59\% af landm{\ae}ndene, der s{\ae}lger alle tyrekalvene, udtrykker et {\o}nske om, at beholde kalvene p{\r a} egen bedrift. Generelt syntes de adspurgte landm{\ae}nd, at det er et problem for dansk {\o}kologisk jordbrug, at tyrekalvene ikke opfedes p{\r a} {\o}kologiske bedrifter.  

Bedrifter, der beholder tyrekalve	
Ud af en r{\ae}kke {\r a}rsager angives et {\o}nske om en helhedsorienteret produktion som den prim{\ae}re {\r a}rsag til at tyrekalvene beholdes p{\r a} bedriften. En typisk malkekv{\ae}gsbedrift med opfedning af tyrekalvene har en lavere bel{\ae}gningsgrad (0.73 {\r a}rsk{\o}er/ha) end de {\o}vrige malkekv{\ae}gsbedrifter (0.81 {\r a}rsk{\o}er/ha) samt st{\o}rre arealer med vedvarende gr{\ae}s. Hver 2. malkekv{\ae}gsbedrift med Jerseyk{\o}er opfeder tyrekalve, hvorimod det kun er hver 4-5 bedrift med SDM og RDM, der opfeder tyrekalve. 

Beskrivelse af oksek{\o}dsproduktion p{\r a} malkekv{\ae}gsbedrifterne
P{\r a} de 96 malkekv{\ae}gsbedrifter med oksek{\o}dsproduktion baseret p{\r a} tyrekalve, som besvarede skemaet, er produktionen baseret p{\r a} stude p{\r a} 61\% af bedrifterne, ungtyre p{\r a} 5\% og kalve p{\r a} 19\% af bedrifterne. P{\r a} de resterende bedrifter var der en blanding af de tre typer. Der var gns. 27 {$\pm$} 25 stude og/eller 14 {$\pm$} 13 ungtyre p{\r a} bedrifterne. Tyrekalvene beholdes p{\r a} bedrifterne, fordi de er en del af produktionen. Mulighed for anvendelse af store m{\ae}ngder grovfoder og afgr{\ae}sning p{\r a} vedvarende gr{\ae}s angives som v{\ae}sentligste {\r a}rsag til at studeproduktion foretr{\ae}kkes, mens ungtyre afvises prim{\ae}rt pga. problemer med at have ungtyre i n{\ae}rheden af kvierne. 

Studeproduktion
P{\r a} 89 bedrifter blev der produceret stude med en gns. forventet afs{\ae}tning p{\r a} 18 {$\pm$} 15 pr. bedrift i 2000. Udfra sp{\o}rgeskemaet angives, at der anvendes klemning p{\r a} 59\% og blodig kastration p{\r a} 37\% af bedrifterne ved en gns. alder p{\r a} knap 4 {$\pm$} 1.5 m{\r a}neder. Marginale gr{\ae}sningsarealer anvendes p{\r a} 75\% af alle bedrifterne, prim{\ae}rt til 2.{\r a}rs dyr. Slutfedning gennemf{\o}res p{\r a} 69\% af bedrifterne med gns. 3.6 {$\pm$} 1.2 kg korn og varer i gns. 2.7 {$\pm$} 0.9 m{\r a}neder. Levende v{\ae}gt ved slagtning for stude ligger p{\r a} gns. 539 {$\pm$} 114 kg ved en alder af 24.6 {$\pm$} 3.5 m{\r a}neder. Der er ingen n{\ae}vnev{\ae}rdige sundhedsm{\ae}ssige problemer, dog n{\ae}vnes parasitproblemer i forbindelse med studeproduktion. 

Oksek{\o}dsproduktion p{\r a} planteavlsbedrifter
P{\r a} de 43 plantebedrifter blev der produceret ungtyre p{\r a} 36\% af bedrifterne og stude p{\r a} 38\%.P{\r a} 49\% af de 43 planteavlsbedrifter med oksek{\o}dsproduktion var produktionen baseret p{\r a} ungtyre af malkerace. Produktionen findes prim{\ae}rt hos deltidslandm{\ae}nd, som ofte kombinerer studeproduktionen med andre dyrehold. De prim{\ae}re {\r a}rsager til at have en oksek{\o}dsproduktion er et {\o}nske om at have dyr p{\r a} bedriften, for at udnytte kl{\o}vergr{\ae}sarealer samt for at udnytte staldkapacitet.     

Beskrivelse af {\o}kologisk studeproduktion ud fra modeller og litteraturstudie
Stude slagtes typisk 16-30 m{\r a}neder gamle ved en levende v{\ae}gt p{\r a} 500-650 kg. En sammenligning af blodig kastration og klemning ved et litteraturstudie tyder p{\r a}, at klemning er den mest sk{\r a}nsomme metode, men der er stadig tvivl p{\r a} omr{\r a}det. Generelt giver en kastration tidligt i dyrets liv den bedste tilv{\ae}kst efter indgrebet og det laveste stressniveau. Litteraturstudiet tyder p{\r a}, at en slutfedning p{\r a} 2-4 m{\r a}neder med en daglig tilv{\ae}kst p{\r a} minimum 900 g er tilstr{\ae}kkelig til at opn{\r a} en form-klassificering p{\r a} 4 (EUROP-skala). Slagtev{\ae}gten er ogs{\r a} afg{\o}rende for formklassificeringen og fedningsgraden, idet begge klassificeringer {\o}ges med stigende slagtev{\ae}gt.

Produktionssystemer med afgr{\ae}sning p{\r a} s{\ae}dskiftearealer kontra vedvarende gr{\ae}s sammenlignes mht. foderforbrug og {\o}konomi. Ved en afgr{\ae}sning p{\r a} s{\ae}dskiftearealer kan der opn{\r a}s en optagelse i gr{\ae}s p{\r a} 54\% af den samlede energioptagelse, mens det kun er 30\% ved afgr{\ae}sning p{\r a} vedvarende gr{\ae}s. Det er en v{\ae}sentlig {\r a}rsag til at afgr{\ae}sning p{\r a} s{\ae}dskiftegr{\ae}s {\o}ger d{\ae}kningsbidraget med 600 kr./stud i forhold til afgr{\ae}sning af vedv. gr{\ae}s beregnet udfra modeller med stykomkostninger p{\r a} eget foder.  D{\ae}kningsbidraget med alternativ v{\ae}rdi p{\r a} s{\ae}dskifteareal (lerjord) er p{\r a} 1200 kr./stud uanset afgr{\ae}sning p{\r a} s{\ae}dskifteareal eller vedv. gr{\ae}s. P{\r a} sandjord er d{\ae}kningsbidraget p{\r a} 2350 og 2700 kr/stud ved afgr{\ae}sning p{\r a} hhv. vedv. gr{\ae}s og s{\ae}dskiftegr{\ae}s. D{\ae}kningsbidraget pr. ha s{\ae}dskiftejord er 5900 kr. ved afgr{\ae}sning p{\r a} vedv. gr{\ae}s, hvilket er 300 kr. h{\o}jere end ved afgr{\ae}sning p{\r a} s{\ae}dskiftegr{\ae}s. En sammenligning med andre driftsgrene viser, at d{\ae}kningsbidraget pr. ha er 30\% h{\o}jere ved dyrkning af v{\r a}rbyg og 130\% h{\o}jere ved m{\ae}lkeproduktion end ved studeproduktion. 
	
Muligheder for at fremme produktionen af {\o}kologisk oksek{\o}d baseret p{\r a} tyrekalve
En d{\r a}rlig {\o}konomi i {\o}kologisk oksek{\o}dsproduktion anses for et generelt problem blandt landm{\ae}ndene. Faktorer, der kan forbedre {\o}konomien vil derfor muligvis kunne fremme produktionen af {\o}kologisk oksek{\o}d. Beregningerne bekr{\ae}fter, at det er stude frem for ungtyre, der pt. kan give det bedste {\o}konomiske afkast under de givne foruds{\ae}tninger. Pr{\ae}mier (28\%) og den {\o}kologiske merpris (18\%) udg{\o}r en stor del af bruttoudbyttet. En tilrettel{\ae}ggelse af produktionen, som udnytter pr{\ae}mier og merpris optimalt er s{\r a}ledes v{\ae}sentligt. Produktion af krydsningsdyr med k{\o}drace er en af mulighederne for at {\o}ge indt{\ae}gten. {\O}kologisk oksek{\o}dsproduktion kan givetvis {\o}ges ved en bedre dokumentation af studeproduktion, b{\r a}de ved modelberegninger samt ved g{\r a}rdstudier, samt en udvikling af produktionssystemet og den biologiske viden til optimering heraf.

A baseline scenario describing the current spring barley cultivation in Denmark was defined, and the expected main deviations were identified (differences in pesticide treatment index, modifications in nitrate leaching and change in crop yield). The main input data originate from experiments, where spring barley cultivars were cultivated in a climate phytotron under controlled and manipulated treatments. Effects of changed climate on both crop productivity and crop quality were represented, as well as impacts of predicted extreme events, simulated through a long heat-wave. LCA results showed that the changed climatic conditions will likely increase the negative impacts on the environment from Danish spring barley cultivation, since all environmental impact categories experienced increased impact for all investigated scenarios, except under the very optimistic assumption that the pace of yield improvement by breeding in the future will be the same as it was in the last decades. The main driver of the increased environmental impact was identified as the reduction in crop yield. Therefore, potential adaptation strategies should mainly focus on maintaining or improving crop productivity. The LCA also showed that selection of proper cultivars for future climate conditions including the challenge from extreme events is one of the most effective ways to reduce future environmental impacts of spring barley. Finally, if yield measurements are based on relative protein content, the negative effects of the future climate seem to be reduced.}

        abstract = {When Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is used to provide insights on how to pursue future food demand, it faces the challenge to describe scenarios of the future in which the environmental impacts occur. In the case of future crop production, the effects of climate change should be considered. In this context, the objectives of this paper are two-fold: (i) to recommend an approach to deal with uncertainty in scenario analysis for LCA of crop production in a changed climate, when the goal of  the study is to suggest strategies for adaptation of crop cultivation practices towards low environmental impacts, and (ii) to implement the suggested approach to spring barley cultivation in Denmark. First, the main implications of climate change for future crop cultivation are analyzed, and the factors which should be included when modeling the climate change effects on crops through LCA are introduced, namely climate, soil, water loss and production parameters. Secondly, the handling of these factors in the inventory modeling is discussed and finally implemented in the case study. Our approach follows a 3-step procedure consisting of: (1) definition of a baseline scenario at the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) level for the selected crop and performance of Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) including normalization and contribution analysis, in order to identify the focus points in terms of impact categories, unit processes and substances; (2) identification of the main deviations from the baseline scenario for these key parameters in alternative future scenarios; (3) comparison of the different scenarios including quantification of the uncertainty at inventory level.
The procedure presented was successfully implemented to assess the consequences of the changed climate on Danish spring barley cultivated under future climate conditions. The LCA results, obtained using mainly primary data from phytotron experiments mimicking a future Danish climate, emphasized that adaptation strategies should prioritize the development of resilient and stable cultivars, i.e. robust to the expected extremes of the future climate and offering a reasonable yield under different climatic conditions.}

        abstract = {Perennial weed infestations are putting severe constraints on organic and conventional farming. Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop. and Tussilago farfara L. have high vegetative regeneration capacity from underground organs. These organs can reach deep soil layers, which prevent them from being easily uprooted. In our research, we primarily addressed the importance of the source-sink dynamics of carbohydrates at different phenological stages and related results to eventual management strategies. 
Experimental work was carried out under greenhouse and/or growth chamber conditions. The first study spanned from roots/rhizomes planting to shoot establishment. The second study began after establishment and included the rosette to the flowering stages. The third study was about the storage of carbohydrates in the underground parts. And finally, a fourth study aimed at unraveling the effect of drought on new shoots of these perennials. 
To determine the depletion of carbohydrate storage associated with shoot development, we destructively sampled roots of C. arvense and rhizomes of T. farfara from which nonstructural carbohydrates were measured using HPLC. We found that fructan was highest at the planting time, but it decreased by releasing fructose as shooting growth progressed. However, before the released fructose was depleted, carbohydrates were reloaded by photo-assimilates. This was demonstrated by 14C labelling to track the commencement of the basipetal translocation of photo-assimilates. The conclusion was that appreciable basipetal translocation starts at 6 and 8 fully developed leaves for T. farfara and C. arvense, respectively. This falls between 500 and 600 degree days or around 21 to 23 days after emergence under our experimental conditions. 
After shoot establishment we measured the maximum net photosynthesis of disturbed and undisturbed clones over a period of 3 weeks, from the rosette stage to the flowering stage. Maximum net photosynthesis decreased over time, but there were no differences between disturbed and undisturbed clones. Our conclusion was that the physiological integration found in other clonal species seems to be absent in C. arvense and T. farfara, suggesting that shoots are autonomous.
To understand carbohydrate storage, juvenile and mature plants were grown at different temperatures. The results showed that the polymerization of fructans was associated with low temperatures for C. arvense but not for T. farfara. Polymerization of fructans in roots/rhizomes was not significantly different between juvenile and mature plants. Only the dry weight of shoots from juvenile plants reflected the differences found in carbohydrate content. The conclusion is that the continuous growth of underground propagules facilitates the survival of these two perennials and thus complicates their control. 
Gradient soil water content during the establishment period of shoots of C. arvense, T. farfara and Elytrigia repens showed that E. repens is more tolerant to water stress than broadleaf T. farfara and C. arvense. T. farfara is more prone to water stress compared to C. arvense if we consider the relationship between the soil water content and shoot biomass. This susceptibility might give an opportunity window for managing broadleaf perennial weeds.

Cirsium arvense infests both conventional and organic crops, while T. farfara is more common in organic cropping systems. Mechanical control used in organic farming often leaves intact shoots within crop rows. It is unknown whether shoots and rhizomes are affected by cutting adjacent interconnected shoots. In glasshouse experiments, comparison of net photosynthesis, chlorophyll a fluorescence and quantum efficiency (Fv/Fm) of disturbed and undisturbed clones, did not show any disturbance effect. Maximum net photosynthesis decreased over time in both disturbed and undisturbed clones, depending on environmental conditions. Maximum net photosynthesis was not affected by the size of removed shoots and the Fv/Fm did not change much from the theoretical value of 0.83. These results imply that there were no source/sink relations in established shoots acting as feedback control for photosynthesis. The resource sharing via horizontal roots/rhizomes did not exist at the rosette growth stage in homogeneous environments. Therefore, both species do not benefit from their clonal interconnectedness as perennial weeds to cope with disturbances, as compared with annual weeds. Further studies are required to investigate this in heterogeneous environments.},

Our thesis is that a transdisciplinary approach needs to build on a working ontology that goes beyond the epistemology of each discipline and that is not just pieced together of the ontologies connected to these different epistemologies. Based on a review of three prevailing theoretical frameworks within the field of agro-sociology: The farming styles approach, the Bawden approach, and Conway?s agroecosystem approach, we argue that these existing theories do not offer such a theoretical framework. The claim of this paper is that a new concept of a farm enterprise as a self-organizing social system, which combines ideas from Actor-Network theory (ANT) and Luhmann?s theory of social systems, can serve as a useful ontological platform for understanding a farm-enterprise as an entity independent of a scientific observer. 
 
In this framework, each farm is understood as a self-organizing node in a complex of heterogeneous socio-technical networks of food, supply, knowledge, technology, etc. This implies that a farm has to be understood as the way in which these network relationships are organised by the farm as a self-organizing social system. Among all the different possible ways in which to interact with the surrounding world, the system has to select a coherent strategy in order to make the farming processes possible at all. 
 
It will be discussed how this framework may add to the understanding of the continuous development of a heterogeneity of farm strategies and contribute to a more comprehensive view of the fields of regulation and extension.}

Among all the different possible ways in which to interact with the surrounding world, the system has to select a coherent strategy in order to make the farming processes possible at all. 
 
It will be discussed how this framework may add to the understanding of the continuous development of a heterogeneity of farm strategies and contribute to a more comprehensive view of the fields of regulation and extension.},

        abstract = {From a rural, sociological point of view no really satisfying social theories suggested have been able to grasp the complexity and special character of a farm entity. The contention of this paper is that a combination of Luhmann?s theory of social systems and the Actor-network Theory of Latour, Callon, and Law offers a fruitful binocular perspective of a farm as a framework for understanding a farm as a self-organizing entity and for studying the social, economic, technical, and biological aspects. The two approaches build on two different ontologies and cannot readily be merged into one theory.

Luhmann?s theory offers an approach to understand a farm as a self-organizing system (operating in meaning) that has to produce and reproduce itself through demarcation from the surrounding world by selection of meaning. The meaning of the system is expressed through the goals, values, and the logic of the farming processes. His theory, however, gets weak on studying the material's heterogeneous character of a farm as a mixture of biology, sociology, technology, and economy.
 
The Actor-network theory offers an approach to focus on the heterogeneous network of interactions of human and non-human actors such as knowledge, technology, money, farmland, animals, plants etc., and as to how these interactions depend on both the quality of the actors and the network context of interaction, but the theory is weak when it comes to explaining the self-organizing character of a farm enterprise.},

        abstract = {As a response to the increasing public focus on the externalities of intensive farming and the resulting pres-sure to strengthen public regulation for farming practices, Danish farmers, within their own farming organi-sations, have begun to formulate their own goals and intentions for the development of environmentally friendly farming. Moreover, the number of organic farms is increasing all over Europe and the EU is pres-ently trying to harmonise the organic rules. However, this coupling of a still more centralised formulation of organic rules and a broader group of farmers not involved in the original value debates in the organic movement might threaten to reduce the potential environmental benefits of conversion to organic farming. For these reasons, there seems to be a need for tools facilitating both conventional and organic farmers to reflect on their current practices and values in the light of society?s demands for environmental goods and nature values.
With the overall aim to facilitate a learning process for farm families, the ethical accounting consists of group dialogues (to help the family clarify its own values and goals in the light of interests existing in soci-ety), a yearly accounting with indicators of resource use, environmental impact and animal welfare, and so on, and a MODS procedure (?multi-objective decisions support?) for strategic planning on the farm in?cluding the new criteria on which the family might want to focus. On the basis of an evaluation of the 20 participating farmers' attitudes toward ethical accounting, a theoretical understanding of the important fac-tors influencing the farmers' involvement in the reflection and farm development process was developed. This approach was subsequently used to structure a questionnaire concerning farmers' interests in decision aids, resource use and the environmental impact of farming. The questionnaire was mailed to about 1000 organic farmers. Results from this analysis will be presented and discussed in the light of the overall theme of possibilities for involving farmers in the development of farming practices in relation to local environ-mental goals. Finally, this topic will be discussed using preliminary results from a project using a social network theory to research 40 neighbouring farmers? possibilities of and motivation for developing envi-ronmentally friendly practices in a small region with sensitive groundwater resources.
With this background, the goal of this chapter is to present an empirical and theoretical reflection on how interactive decision tools can contribute to the involvement of farmers in developing more environmentally friendly farming practices.}

        abstract = {European farmers are encouraged to participate in conserving national biodiversity on farms especially remnant old, undisturbed small biotopes, forests and permanent grassland. It is foreseen that this objective cannot rely on regulation solely, and to succeed, farmers need to understand the goals behind it. A set of indicators have been developed and tested on eight organic farms as part of a ?green-account? based dialogue to explore whether the farmers were able and willing to include such indicators in their decision making. ?Weed cover in cereal fields,? ?was used as an indicator of floral and faunal biodiversity in the cultivated land, and ?uncultivated biotope area? on the farm was used as an unspecific measure of wildlife habitats. In uncultivated biotopes, herbal plants divided into functional groups  - inspired by Grime?s stress tolerant plants - and low mobility butterflies were used as indicators of conservation value. The functional grouping, discriminating between ?high conservation value? plant species on one hand and ?competitive? and ?ruderal? species on the other, proved to be a useful tool for developing the often used indiscriminate species richness measures into indicators focusing on the few sites left with considerable remnant conservation value. At biotope scale the high conservation value species contributed almost 50\% of the average species richness per biotope (9.5 out of 20.3 species), and between-biotope and between-farm variation increased when only conservation value species was considered. The reproducibility of the indicators was fairly good. The reactions of the organic farmers revealed that the ideas and goals of conservation of wildlife quality are not necessarily the same for biologists as for farmers (even organic) and the farmers expressed very different opinions on the idea that conservation of wildlife quality is a question of the absence of modern agricultural impact. However, farmers also stated that the information given by the indicators and especially the dialogue with the advisors had influenced their perception and awareness of wildlife. We conclude that mapping of wildlife quality combined with a dialogue process should be a key component of a farm wildlife management advisory tool at farm level.},

        abstract = {Artiklen analyserer udviklingen i landbruget med udgangspunkt i Luhmanns systemteori og med s{\ae}rlig fokus p{\r a} begreberne om afkobling og strukturelle koblinger. I et stadigt mere komplekst samfund er reduktion (eller rettere udgr{\ae}nsning) af kompleksitet en n{\o}dvendig men kontingent udvikling. I landbruget ser vi denne udvikling b{\r a}de i form af en uddifferentiering af semantikker og tilh{\o}rende funktionssystemer og i form af horisontale og vertikale specialiseringer og uddifferentieringer. De logiske konsekvenser heraf er for det f{\o}rste at de enkelte organisations- og funktionssystemers omverden (dvs. den verden de kan lade sig irritere af) bliver forenklet, og dermed sker der en r{\ae}kke afkoblinger. For det andet, og som kompensation for denne udvikling, er det n{\o}dvendigt at udvikle nye strukturelle koblinger mellem disse systemer for at kompensere for uddifferentieringen.  
En yderligere konsekvens af denne udvikling er, at der sker en r{\ae}kke reaktioner i omgivelserne som begynder at irritere tilbage i andre former, og der opst{\r a}r endnu flere specialiserede semantikker.  De semantikker der er uddifferentieret som egentlige funktioner, s{\o}ger at genintroducere irritationen af landbrugsbedrifterne via f.eks. lovgivne restriktioner eller i form af skatter og afgifter. I artiklen fokuserer vi analysen p{\r a} andre og nye muligheder for strukturelle (gen)koblinger, med udgangspunkt i en r{\ae}kke aktuelle tiltag og bev{\ae}gelser; koblinger der kan bidrage til at genintroducere omgivelsernes irritation til systemerne. Vi skelner mellem tre former for strukturelle koblinger: 1) De strukturelle koblinger som landbrugsvirksomheden producerer for at genintroducere omgivelser til omverden, dog i reduceret form via de generaliserede medier som funktionssystemerne tilbyder. 2) Strukturelle koblinger mellem organisationer der kan h{\r a}ndtere andre dimensioner end blot pris og kvantitet. Her skelner vi mellem de medierede koblingsmuligheder som de generaliserede medier, som f.eks. {\O}-m{\ae}rket, tilbyder, og koblingsmuligheder i bindende men dynamiske samarbejdsaftaler i netv{\ae}rket, som afh{\ae}nger af og giver mulighed for ko-evolution. 3) Anden ordens semantiske strukturelle koblinger af iagttagelser af iagttagelser, som f.eks. knytter sig til b{\ae}redygtighedssemantikken; semantikker der netop har deres styrke og udfordring ved at de forbliver ubestemte i deres form. 
Analysen viser at Luhmanns begreb om strukturelle koblinger ikke kun er st{\ae}rkt n{\r a}r det g{\ae}lder om at analysere og forst{\r a} udviklingsprocesserne i jordbruget, men at dette begrebsapparat ogs{\r a} kan danne grundlag for at arbejde konstruktivt med de udfordringer som uddifferentieringen producerer.

But even though farmers know these principles, they have not implemented them in practice. This paper aims to improve our understanding of this ?knowledge gap? using the theory of knowledge asymmetries, and discusses the implications for research, extension and practice. The paper is based on interviews with 10 organic arable farms focused on how to understand the barriers from the perspective and context of the farming system. The findings show that some barriers are due to lack of knowledge of suggested actions, calling for more ordinary dissemination. But this cannot at all explain all the barriers. The farming systems face paradoxes of fragmented knowledge; if they try to improve one problem, this creates other problems. More scientific knowledge produces more paradoxes, and the farming systems lack tools to handle this. Systems research is meant to counteract this fragmentation, but has difficulties dealing with the plurality of practical contexts. And science has to deal with the dilemma of being superior and minor to practice at the same time. A perspectival understanding of science could be a step in that direction. },

This paper describes the approaches and preliminary results of a study that is designed to provide a large amount of data at a range of scales in order to investigate the potential factors influencing biodiversity on arable farmland on comparable organic and conventional farms. In particular, the study examines the role of non-crop habitats within the different farming systems and how the extent and management of non-crop habitats differs between them. A detailed description of the methodologies being employed to establish differences in non-crop habitat, plant, invertebrate and bird diversity is given. The study remains in its early stages as a result of the impact of Foot and Mouth disease on the fieldwork schedule during 2001. The process of setting up the study revealed that the numbers of farmers growing cereals organically are low as a proportion of the organic sector as a whole, despite recent large increases in numbers of farmers converting to organic production. Preliminary results from the first year of fieldwork on plants reveal significant differences between organic and conventional farms in terms of the numbers of weed species on fields and non-significant differences in numbers of species found on non-crop habitats.},

The foundation was facilitated by the government of Indonesia, in collaboration with the German agency for technical cooperation (Deutsche Gesellschaft f{\"u}r Technische Zusammenarbeit, GTZ), under the ?Organic and Fairtrade Cacao in Aceh? Program. Through the GTZ program, the farmers received training on sustainable cacao cultivation system, which spans the land preparation through to post-harvest processing. The program supported the construction of cooperative?s office and processing unit buildings. It also supported the certification of organic cacao, in collaboration with an international certification agency, the Institute for Marketecology (IMO) of Switzerland.

Some cacao farmers had previously heard of organic farming, but they had not understood how to perform organic farming correctly. To support the organic standard conformance by the farmers, the cooperative developed an internal control system (ICS). The cooperative also promotes the organic cacao program to its farmer members. }

        abstract = {Tomato is an important vegetable crop grown worldwide. In Tanzania, it is grown by small and medium scale farmers as a source of income and consumption. Tanzanian Tomato production reported dropping by 50\% due to several factors mainly pests and diseases. The devastating pest threatening tomato production is the South American native tomato leaf miner, Tuta Absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) 
The aim of this study was to provide a contribution to the understanding of the pest problem caused by T. absoluta, farmer?s decision to management and test insecticides use alternatives to minimise losses caused by the pest and other pests of tomatoes amongst smallholder farmers in Morogoro.  
The study involved two parts, interviews and surveys on tomato production practices and a field experiment testing the efficacy of the management practices on tomato productivity. It involved 75 questionnaires from 25 responded in each of the three study areas Doma, Wami-Dakawa and Kipera respectively. The field experiment was a randomised complete block design (RCBD) with four treatments, neem extract, netting, an insecticide flubendiamine 480g/l and a no treatment control with five replications. The experiment included two sites(Kipera and Wami-Dakawa.  
The results showed that farmers understand T. absoluta as a problem to tomato production and use insecticides to manage the pest with less understanding on the proper insecticide to use. Results from the field experiment showed that the insecticides use alternatives (neem, and netting) treatment significantly increased yield in comparison to the control. There were no significantly different between the alternatives to the insecticides flubendiamine 480 g/l suggesting that the alternative can be included in the IPM program to manage the pest as they have the less side effect to health and environment as compared to an insecticide.  Regarding pest population, the treatments significantly reduced the population of T. absoluta, noctuid, whiteflies and aphids compared to the control. Although, the netting was not effective in the control of spider mites. The spider mites population was high in the netting and not significantly different to the control. Further investigation should be performed by integrating other methods to reduce the population of spidermites in the netting.}

In the ongoing field experiment (1999-2002) staggered sowing of red clover seed was tested to regulate the clover content of the mixed sward. Sowing strategy did not have clear effect on the clover content or the yield of the sward. However the seeding rate affected the clover density of the field (plants/m?) in the first year. After two years the differences were equated. The best strategy to control the clover amount in the mixed swards seems sowing of 2 or 3 kg/ha (100 or 150 seeds/m?) clover seeds in establishment and then oversow on a first second ley year 1 or 2 kg/ha (50 or 100 seeds/m?).},

The ley yield and clover content of one-, two- and three-year-old leys were determined on eight organic farms in 1998. Two-year-old leys produced the highest (6500 kg/ha dm) and three-year-old leys (4900 kg/ha dm) the lowest yields, with no significant differences between one- and two-year-old leys. The clover content (20-80 \% of dm) diminished to the same extent as the yields. 

Because the ley samples from the organic farms gave strong evidence of decreasing yield level and clover content in the 3-year-old leys, we started to develop a technique to maintain the ley productivity in older swards. This technique includes oversowing of clover in the spring of the second ley year and utilization of lime-pelleted, pre-inoculated seed. Lime-pelleted, pre-inoculated clover seed oversown at different times in spring were compared with the aim of developing an oversowing method for Finnish conditions. The preliminary results do not show any differences, but studies are ongoing.},

There are two strategies to follow and they can be combined. One is to utilize by-products, and explore new protein sources or refine already existing products. The other is to feed the animals less intensively and for this strategy slow-growing breeds will be useful due to a lower nutrient requirement. However, the possibilities for combinations of regionally grown feed, slow-growing breeds with different feeding strategies are many and they need to be explored.}

In the first section of the trial the performance of two different bird strains (ISA 257 and colourpac) was investigated during the summer season, and in the second section the per-formance of a ISA 257 strain was investigated during the winter season.  Agronomic and welfare factors as well as production traits were considered. The first section of the trial revealed no overall health, growth or welfare concerns or increases in production costs when comparing the two rations. Some minor differ-ences were identified between the two strains of bird.  The second section of the investigation is still on going, but there are early indications of a increase in cost and larger differential in performance for birds on the one hundred per cent ration, when compared to the spring/summer trial.}

Soil sam-ples from 0 to 20 cm depth were taken in spring, between 1993 to 1996 every year and after 1998 every second year. The samples were analysed for soil microbial biomass (substrate induced respiration SIR and since 2002 chloroform fumigation extraction CFE), soil respiration and nitrogen mineralisation. All parameters showed clear and stable differences between plots, depending on soil characteristics. Although significant differences between farming systems in single plots or for single parame-ters occurred, there could not be found any overall significant differences between the three farming systems. Although this result is contradictory to findings in the literature, it is confirmed by other investigations in Switzerland. It may be explained by the fact that both IP as well as the organic farming system had the same crop rotations and both got organic manure, as it is common agricultural practice in Switzerland.},

        abstract = {Organic livestock production can be considered as a system of production that better fulfills animal needs, promotes use of organic and biodegradable input for production and reduce the use of conventional veterinary treatments. As demand for organic dairy products increases in Kenya, especially in Nairobi, so does the need to supply the growing demand. Increased diversification of organic production is needed to meet the growing demand. The objective of this study was therefore to investigate the potential, challenges and feasibility of integrating organic milk production in smallholder crop-livestock farms in Kiambu and Kajiado counties of Kenya and validate the efficacy of Tephrosia vogelii Hook., Tephrosia villosa Pers., and Carica papaya Linn. leaves and  Carica papaya Linn. against gastrointestinal nematodes. Data was obtained through purposive cross-sectional survey of 55 certified organic crop producers with dairy cattle. It was complemented with additional information from longitudinal and targeted semi-structured interviews from 24 farmers randomly selected from previous cross-sectional survey. A laboratory experiment was also conducted to validate the efficacy of crude aqueous plant extracts (Tephrosia vogelii Hook., Tephrosia villosa Pers., and Carica papaya Linn. leaves and  Carica papaya Linn.). Result from the study showed that lack of organic inputs to control pest and diseases (78\%) and lack of organic feed (64\%) were the most important constraints for farmers to integrate organic dairy production. The average herd size was 3.53 with all the dairy cows were zero-grazed. Most of the cubicles were less than 2.50M2 (75\%) and majority of the farmers used acaricides on a weekly basis to control ticks (47\%), while all incidences of diseases were treated by a veterinarian. Dried and poultice paste of T. vogelii leaves and C. papaya seeds had more than 95.8\% and 98\% reduction in egg hatch and larval development inhibition at concentration of 500 mg/ml respectively.

Egg hatch assay revealed more than 95.8\% reduction in egg hatch at concentration of 500 mg/ml for dried and poultice paste of T. vogelii leaves and C.papaya seeds. Larval development inhibition assay results showed that both dried and poultice paste of T. vogelii leaves and C.papaya seeds extract yielded more than 98\% inhibition at a concentrations of 500mg/ml. Based on the LD50 dried extract of C. papaya seeds was most potent extracts for the inhibition of both egg hatching (49.94mg/ml) and larval development (49.32mg/ml). From the fore going results it is observed that integration of organic dairy production in smallholder farms is constrained by inadequate organic feeds, lack of organic inputs to control pests and diseases, inadequate space for structures and outdoor runs to meet the welfare needs of the cows. Thus, solutions to the constraints to integration must concurrently involve financial, technical and institutional support for converting farmers.},

        abstract = {Genetically modified (GM) crops (e.g. maize, soybean, oilseed rape and cotton) have been produced commercially since 1996. In 2016, 185 million hectares of GM crops were grown globally corresponding to 3.4\% of the worldwide utilised agricultural area (UAA). Compared to Canada or the US, cultivation of GM crops in the EU agriculture is limited and decreased by 4.2\% from136,338 ha UAA in 2016 to 130,571 ha UAA in 2017. Indeed, GM crops, are mainly grown in Spain and Portugal. The EU coexistence strategy seeks to ensure the choice of consumers and farmers between conventional, organic and GM crop production. As adventitious presence of GM crops in non-GM crops cannot be excluded, suitable measures are needed during cultivation, harvest, transport, storage and processing to ensure coexistence. So far, most coexistence studies focus on costs for GM producers even though coexistence involves cost for both the GM and the non-GM producer. Furthermore, there is a lack of studies from cases where coexistence is a real issue such as in Spain. Therefore, there is the need to analyse the socio-economic impacts of GM production on the actors of organic or non-GM supply chains.}

        abstract = {Efter en uge med meget t{\o}rt og bl{\ae}sende vejr var det sk{\o}nt at f{\r a} lidt regn. P{\r a} sandjorden p{\r a} Jyndevad k{\o}rte vandingen for fuld kraft og selv p{\r a} den lerblandede sandjord p{\r a} Foulum var nogle af de kraftigere afgr{\o}der begyndt at vise tegn p{\r a} vandmangel. Det er ganske tydeligt, at en g{\o}det afgr{\o}de efter en god forfrugt bruger mere vand end en spinkel ug{\o}det afgr{\o}de.

S{\r a}tidspunkt i vinterhvede

De sidste to {\r a}r har vi fors{\o}gt os med tidlig s{\r a}ning af vinters{\ae}den p{\r a} Jyndevad og Foulum. P{\r a} Jyndevad dyrker vi vinterrug, og her klarer en tidlig s{\r a}ning sig fint. Rugen vokser godt til i efter{\r a}ret og kan med lidt hj{\ae}lp af ukrudtsstriglen sagtens konkurrere med ukrudtet.

P{\r a} Foulum dyrker vi vinterhvede, som er langt mindre konkurrencedygtig mod ukrudtet. Is{\ae}r vokser vinterhvede betydeligt langsommere om efter{\r a}ret, og den yder kun ringe konkurrence mod ukrudtet. I de f{\o}rste fire {\r a}r blev vinterhveden p{\r a} Foulum s{\r a}et omkring 1 oktober. Det gav en lille ukrudtsfremspiring og sm{\r a} ukrudtsplanter, som forholdsvis let kunne klares med harvninger om for{\r a}ret.

Den sene s{\r a}ning gav dog en svagt etableret hvede, og vi har derfor i de seneste to {\r a}r fors{\o}gt med s{\r a}ning af vinterhvede i begyndelsen af september. Vi valgte samtidigt at fordoble r{\ae}kkeafstanden, s{\r a} vi kunne bruge radrenseren til at kontrollere ukrudtet. Det er ikke g{\r a}et s{\r a} godt. Hveden stod betydeligt bedre i efter{\r a}ret, men er ikke v{\ae}sentligt kraftigere her i juni  end den var tidligere. Dette skyldes nok en generel mangel p{\r a} kv{\ae}lstof. Til geng{\ae}ld har vi nu en betydeligt kraftigere bestand af ukrudt, is{\ae}r kamille, hvilket ogs{\r a} bliver at m{\ae}rke p{\r a} udbyttet. Dette til trods for en meget intensiv ukrudtsbek{\ae}mpelse med to harvninger og en radrensning i efter{\r a}ret, og den samme behandling i for{\r a}ret.

Lupin p{\r a} sand- og lerjord

I {\r a}r dyrker vi lupin sammen med v{\r a}rbyg, p{\r a} Jyndevad dog ogs{\r a} i blanding med hesteb{\o}nner. Dette er gjort for at {\o}ge udbyttestabiliteten i b{\ae}lgs{\ae}dsafgr{\o}den samt for at {\o}ge konkurrenceevnen mod ukrudt. Sidste {\r a}r var der store udbyttetab i lupin p{\r a} Jyndevad som f{\o}lge af gr{\r a}skimmel, og p{\r a} Holeby og Flakkebjerg var lupinen meget beskidt med ukrudt, p{\r a} Flakkebjerg is{\ae}r kvik. Det skyldtes en d{\r a}rligere etablering p{\r a} lerjordene og at lupin smider bladene sidst p{\r a} s{\ae}sonen. Herved bliver afgr{\o}den meget {\r a}ben og inviterer ligefrem kvikken til at stikke hovedet frem.

I {\r a}r st{\r a}r lupinen betydeligt bedre p{\r a} Jyndevad og Foulum sammenlignet med Flakkebjerg og Holeby. Det h{\ae}nger formentlig sammen med s{\r a}vel jord- som klimaforhold. Det virker som om lupin er noget f{\o}lsom over for d{\r a}rlig jordstruktur i etableringsfasen. Derimod er lupin tilsyneladende nogenlunde ligeglad med forhistorien. Det samme er ikke tilf{\ae}ldet med hesteb{\o}nner, som dyrkes i blandingen p{\r a} Jyndevad. Her st{\r a}r hesteb{\o}nnerne 10-15 cm lavere i de parceller, hvor der ikke har v{\ae}ret givet g{\o}dning i de foreg{\r a}ende {\r a}r. Der g{\o}des ikke i selve b{\ae}lgs{\ae}dsafgr{\o}den.

        abstract = {Nu er sommeren snart ved at v{\ae}re g{\r a}et. Det blev en sommer med meget variabelt vejr. P{\r a} alle fors{\o}gssteder er der kommet passende med regn til at etableret udl{\ae}gget godt i s{\ae}dskiftefors{\o}get. Det varme vejr har dog kostet lidt ekstra vanding i {\r a}r p{\r a} sandjorden p{\r a} Jyndevad. Nu h{\r a}ber vi bare p{\r a}, at vejret ogs{\r a} kan holde t{\o}rt i h{\o}sten.

Etablering af udl{\ae}g
Der har tidligere is{\ae}r v{\ae}ret problemer med at etablere et godt kl{\o}verudl{\ae}g p{\r a} Foulum. Det skyldes ikke alene konkurrence fra den g{\o}dede d{\ae}ks{\ae}d, men ogs{\r a} at der forekom meget ukrudt, der ogs{\r a} konkurrerede med kl{\o}veren i bunden af afgr{\o}den. Ukrudtet har tidligere v{\ae}ret fremmet af at g{\o}dningen er nedharvet i s{\r a}bedet. Desuden blev der ikke er gennemf{\o}rt ukrudtsbek{\ae}mpelse, fordi udl{\ae}gget er uds{\r a}et omtrent samtidigt med d{\ae}ks{\ae}den. I {\r a}r har vi valgt at nedf{\ae}lde gyllen, og samtidigt er der gennemf{\o}rt b{\r a}de en blindstrigling og en efterf{\o}lgende ukrudtsharvning. Det har resulteret i betydeligt mindre ukrudt end i tidligere {\r a}r.
	P{\r a} Foulum er halvdelen af kl{\o}vergr{\ae}s-udl{\ae}gget uds{\r a}et sammen med kornet. B{\r a}de gr{\ae}s og kl{\o}ver spirede p{\ae}nt frem i kornr{\ae}kkerne, men kun noget af gr{\ae}sset og enkelte r{\o}dkl{\o}ver-planter har overlevet ukrudtsharvningen. Den resterende halvdel af udl{\ae}gget blev uds{\r a}et efter ukrudtsharvningen, og en regnbyge dagen efter sikrede en god fremspiring.

Efterafgr{\o}der
Der begynder nu at v{\ae}re gode effekter af efterafgr{\o}der i de fleste af s{\ae}dskifterne. Det er bl.a. tilf{\ae}ldet i s{\ae}dskiftet uden kl{\o}vergr{\ae}s, hvor efterafgr{\o}den af hvidkl{\o}ver har givet et rigtigt godt grundlag for v{\r a}rbyggen.
	De gode effekter af efterafgr{\o}derne skyldes nok b{\r a}de en effekt p{\r a} afgr{\o}dernes kv{\ae}lstofforsyning, men ogs{\r a} gunstige effekter p{\r a} andre n{\ae}ringsstoffer og p{\r a} jordstrukturen. At efterafgr{\o}der ogs{\r a} kan spille en rolle for afgr{\o}dernes kaliumforsyning kan ses p{\r a} Jyndevad. Her er der n{\ae}rmest misv{\ae}kst af kl{\o}ver i kl{\o}vergr{\ae}smarker uden g{\o}dningstilf{\o}rsel, men kun i systemerne uden efterafgr{\o}der. I systemerne med efterafgr{\o}der er der tydelige symptomer p{\r a} kaliummangel, men kl{\o}veren gror dog alligevel nogenlunde fornuftigt.
	P{\r a} b{\r a}de Foulum og Flakkebjerg dyrkes i {\r a}r lupin. Begge steder vokser denne afgr{\o}de tydeligt bedst, hvor der er efterafgr{\o}der i systemet. Dette skyldes formentlig en gunstig virkning af efterafgr{\o}derne p{\r a} jordstrukturen, som fremmer rodudvikling og dannelse de rodknolde, der er grundlaget for kv{\ae}lstoffikseringen. Der er nogen ukrudt i lupinen p{\r a} begge fors{\o}gssteder. V{\ae}rst st{\r a}r det til p{\r a} Flakkebjerg i parceller med efterafgr{\o}der, hvor der ikke blev foretaget ukrudtsbek{\ae}mpelse. P{\r a} Foulum er der lidt mindre ukrudt i parceller med efterafgr{\o}der, fordi lupinerne her har groet lidt bedre til og fordi der her er foretaget ukrudtsbek{\ae}mpelse.

Det er derfor tid at g{\o}re en forel{\o}big status for b{\r a}de {\r a}ret og for de f{\o}rste fire {\r a}r samlet. Forel{\o}bige tal for {\r a}rets udbytter foreligger nu fra alle fors{\o}gssteder.

Udbytter
	I {\r a}r har vinterhveden efter kl{\o}vergr{\ae}s klaret sig fint p{\r a} lerjordene med udbytter p{\r a} ca. 80 hkg/ha ved Holeby og 70 hkg/ha ved Flakkebjerg. Udbyttet i s{\r a}vel vinterhvede som v{\r a}rhvede p{\r a} sandjorden ved Jyndevad ligger derimod som de tidligere {\r a}r p{\r a} omkring 40 hkg/ha.
	V{\r a}rs{\ae}den har generelt klaret sig fint alle steder. Det g{\ae}lder dog ikke {\ae}rt/byg til modenhed. Her er udbytterne helt i orden p{\r a} Jyndevad og Foulum, men meget d{\r a}rlige i {\ae}rt p{\r a} Flakkebjerg og Holeby. Her ligger {\ae}rteandelen p{\r a} under 10\%, selv i de tilf{\ae}lde hvor byggen ikke konkurrerer v{\ae}sentligt med {\ae}rterne. Det samme billede har vi ogs{\r a} set i tidligere {\r a}r, og havde en mistanke til at det kunne skyldes d{\r a}rlig etablering p{\r a} grund af for ringe s{\r a}dybde for {\ae}rternes vedkommende. I {\r a}r blev s{\r a}dybden {\o}get, hvilket gav en god etablering, men stadigv{\ae}k al for ringe v{\ae}kst i {\ae}rterne.
	Lupinen p{\r a} Jyndevad har i {\r a}r givet et alt for lavt udbytte (ca. 26 hkg/ha) p{\r a} grund af angreb af gr{\r a}skimmel. Angrebet har v{\ae}ret v{\ae}rst i parceller med fangafgr{\o}der. Det kan m{\r a}ske skyldes, at rajgr{\ae}sset n{\r a}r at vokse godt til i l{\o}bet af sensommeren, n{\r a}r lupinafgr{\o}den taber nogle af bladene. Muligvis er rajgr{\ae}sset med til at skabe et ekstra fugtigt klima til gavn for svampesygdommen og til skade for udbyttet.

Vinters{\ae}d
	I skrivende stund (midt september) er der meget stor forskel i vinters{\ae}den mellem fors{\o}gsstederne. Vi er nemlig delvis startet p{\r a} n{\ae}ste rotation, og har i den sammenh{\ae}ng {\ae}ndret en del p{\r a} etablering af vinters{\ae}den.
	P{\r a} Jyndevad er vinterhvede skiftet ud med rug, som er s{\r a}et midt i august. Den groede meget hurtigt til, men det gjorde ukrudtet ogs{\r a}.  Der er lavet to gode ukrudtsharvninger, og rugen har busket sig godt og lukker godt for ukrudtet nu. Rugen er dog meget angrebet af meldug.
	P{\r a} Foulum blev vinters{\ae}den (rug og hvede) s{\r a}et den 6 september. Rugen har nu 1? blade og hvede 1 blad. Desv{\ae}rre har den meget regn bevirket, at der ikke kunne blindstrigles. Ukrudtet er derfor ogs{\r a} spiret godt frem. Vi afventer, at afgr{\o}den bliver lidt kraftigere inden der bek{\ae}mpes ukrudt. Afgr{\o}derne er s{\r a}et p{\r a} dobbelt r{\ae}kkeafstand, s{\r a}ledes at der kan radrenses.
	P{\r a} Flakkebjerg og Holeby vil vinterhvede blive s{\r a}et sidst i september.

Nyt s{\ae}dskifte
	Smertens barn i fors{\o}get har v{\ae}ret s{\ae}dskiftet uden kl{\o}vergr{\ae}s, som i de sidste fire {\r a}r har v{\ae}ret: havre, vinterhvede, vinters{\ae}d, {\ae}rt/byg. I systemet uden fangafgr{\o}der er {\ae}rt/byg den eneste kv{\ae}lstoffikserende afgr{\o}de i s{\ae}dskiftet. I systemet med fangafgr{\o}der etableres et kl{\o}verudl{\ae}g i havren, og vinters{\ae}den samdyrkes de to efterf{\o}lgende {\r a}r med kl{\o}veren. Denne samdyrkning har givet alt for lave kornudbytter ved Foulum, og kun m{\r a}delige resultater ved Flakkebjerg.
	S{\ae}dskiftet vil derfor fra n{\ae}ste {\r a}r blive {\ae}ndret til: vinterhvede, havre, v{\r a}rbyg, lupin. Her er det tanken i systemet med fangafgr{\o}de at etablere kl{\o}veren som udl{\ae}g i vinterhvede. Havren vil blive samdyrket med kl{\o}veren, idet der findes gode erfaringer fra fors{\o}g med dette. Havren er generelt mere konkurrencedygtig end hvede og derfor formentlig ogs{\r a} bedre i stand til at klare konkurrencen med kl{\o}veren. Efter havren bliver kl{\o}veren liggende til det f{\o}lgende for{\r a}r, hvor det pl{\o}jes op forud for v{\r a}rbyg. Denne kl{\o}verpels b{\o}r v{\ae}re i stand til at give et v{\ae}sentligt bidrag til kv{\ae}lstofforsyningen i v{\r a}rbyggen.

	Sidst i maj kom der endelig regn oven p{\r a} en ellers meget t{\o}r m{\r a}ned. Det var noget, som is{\ae}r udl{\ae}gget og vinters{\ae}den tr{\ae}ngte til. Der er allerede vandet flere gange i vinters{\ae}den p{\r a} sandjorden p{\r a} Jyndevad.

Kl{\o}vergr{\ae}smarker
	Kl{\o}vergr{\ae}sset er kv{\ae}lstof-motoren i flere af s{\ae}dskifterne i fors{\o}get. En god kl{\o}verbestand er derfor afg{\o}rende for et godt produktionsresultat. Virkningerne af g{\o}dskning begynder nu for alvor at sl{\r a} igennem p{\r a} kl{\o}vergr{\ae}sset, men effekten varierer meget mellem fors{\o}gsstederne. Det skal understreges, at der ikke g{\o}des i kl{\o}vergr{\ae}sset, s{\r a} det er effekter af g{\o}dning i de foreg{\r a}ende {\r a}r.
	P{\r a} Jyndevad lider ug{\o}dede parceller af kaliummangel. Sidste {\r a}r blev der tilf{\o}rt kaliumg{\o}dning i disse parceller, men vi undlod kaliumg{\o}dskning i en af underparcellerne. Her er der n{\ae}sten intet kl{\o}ver tilbage, og de overlevende kl{\o}verplanter har alle typiske symptomer p{\r a} kaliummangel. Gr{\ae}s og kornafgr{\o}der reagerer ikke helt s{\r a} kraftigt p{\r a} kaliummangel.
	P{\r a} Foulum og Holeby er der mangel p{\r a} kl{\o}ver i de g{\o}dede parceller. Det samme har vi set i de foreg{\r a}ende {\r a}r. Det skyldes, at kl{\o}veren h{\ae}mmes af konkurrence af den g{\o}dede d{\ae}ks{\ae}d. Kl{\o}veren kan dog n{\r a} at brede sig i l{\o}bet af sommeren, hvis kl{\o}vergr{\ae}sset afsl{\r a}s tilpas ofte. Sidste {\r a}r blev kl{\o}vergr{\ae}sset kun afsl{\r a}et to gange, og det var ikke tilstr{\ae}kkeligt. I {\r a}r vil vi pr{\o}ve med tre gange.
	P{\r a} Flakkebjerg er der den meget p{\ae}n bestand af kl{\o}ver i alle parceller med kl{\o}vergr{\ae}s, men gr{\ae}sset st{\r a}r mest kraftigt i de parceller, der tidligere er blevet g{\o}det. Det skyldes n{\ae}ppe etableringen af kl{\o}veren, men m{\r a}ske snarere eftervirkninger af kv{\ae}lstofg{\o}dning fra forudg{\r a}ende {\r a}r.

Rodukrudt
	Rodukrudtet i form af tidsler og kvik forekommer nu p{\r a} b{\r a}de alle fors{\o}gssteder. Dog i varierende m{\ae}ngder. P{\r a} Jyndevad er kvik det st{\o}rste problem. Her vil vi igen i {\r a}r bek{\ae}mpe kvikken i kl{\o}vergr{\ae}smarken. Efter det f{\o}rste eller andet sl{\ae}t foretages en sk{\ae}lpl{\o}jning, og kvikken bek{\ae}mpes ved gentagne harvninger. Der sluttes af med en dyb pl{\o}jning, hvorefter der s{\r a}s en hurtigtvoksende efterafgr{\o}de eller vinters{\ae}den s{\r a}s tidligt.
	Sidste {\r a}r viste denne metode sig vanskeligere end vi troede. Det skyldes is{\ae}r, at vejret gav gode betingelser for genv{\ae}kst af kvikken. Det var vanskeligt at udsulte kvikken og n{\ae}sten umuligt at udt{\o}rre den. Effekten blev dog ganske god, og vi har endnu ikke set kvik i disse parceller i {\r a}r. Vi h{\r a}ber p{\r a} endnu bedre resultater i {\r a}r.

        abstract = {I juni m{\r a}ned sidste {\r a}r samledes fyrre forskere fra Europa og USA p{\r a} Landbrugsskolen i Borris i tre dage. M{\o}det var arrangeret af Forskningscenter for {\O}kologisk Jordbrug (F{\O}JO) og havde til form{\r a}l at diskutere status og fremtidig retning for forskning i {\o}kologiske s{\ae}dskifter.

Form{\r a}let med forskning i s{\ae}dskifter er at {\o}ge forst{\r a}elsen af {\r a}rsagerne til de fordele, som gode s{\ae}dskifter indeb{\ae}rer. Dette sker med henblik p{\r a} at forbedre r{\r a}dgivningen vedr{\o}rende den praktiske h{\r a}ndtering af s{\ae}dskifter, afgr{\o}der og jord. Problemstillingerne unders{\o}ges med en bred vifte af metoder, som bl.a. omfatter langvarige s{\ae}dskiftefors{\o}g, g{\r a}rdstudier og matematiske modeller.

Der er en r{\ae}kke igangv{\ae}rende langvarige fors{\o}g i Europa med forskellige s{\ae}dskifter under {\o}kologisk dyrkning. P{\r a} m{\o}det blev resultater fra 10 s{\r a}danne fors{\o}g pr{\ae}senteret. Nogle af fors{\o}gene omfatter ogs{\r a} sammenligninger med konventionel dyrkning, flere g{\o}dningsniveauer eller forskellig h{\r a}ndtering af efterafgr{\o}der.

B{\r a}de klima og jordtype varierer betydeligt i Europa. Dette afspejler sig i de s{\ae}dskifter, der indg{\r a}r i fors{\o}gene. Under de k{\o}lige og forholdsvis fugtige klimaforhold i Norge og Skotland domineres s{\ae}dskifterne af kl{\o}vergr{\ae}s, foder- og v{\r a}rs{\ae}dsafgr{\o}der. Klimaet i de baltiske lande er mere kontinentalt og derfor koldere om vinteren og varmere om sommeren, og generelt lidt t{\o}rre. Disse klimaforhold muligg{\o}r en r{\ae}kke forskellige afgr{\o}der, men den t{\o}rre sommer og tidlig kulde om efter{\r a}ret vanskeligg{\o}r etablering af efterafgr{\o}der. Central- og {\O}steuropa er ogs{\r a} pr{\ae}get af det kontinentale klima, som dog generelt er varmere. Det muligg{\o}r dyrkning af majs til modenhed, hvilket indg{\r a}r i mange af s{\ae}dskifterne. I Middelhavslandene er sommert{\o}rke ofte et stort problem. Her indg{\r a}r ofte majs, solsikke, durum-hvede og {\ae}rter i s{\ae}dskifterne. P{\r a} grund af den tidlige h{\o}st er der her store muligheder for at udnytte efter{\r a}rs- og vinters{\ae}sonen til dyrkning af kv{\ae}lstoffikserende efterafgr{\o}der.

I den {\o}vrige del af Vesteuropa, som omfatter bl.a. Danmark, England og Tyskland, er der en stor variation i de afgr{\o}der, der indg{\r a}r i s{\ae}dskifterne. Her er de klimatiske begr{\ae}sninger ikke helt s{\r a} afg{\o}rende som i visse af de {\o}vrige regioner. Til geng{\ae}ld kan forskelle i jordtypen spille en stor rolle.

M{\o}det viste, at der p{\r a} trods af de store regionale forskelle, ogs{\r a} er en r{\ae}kke f{\ae}lles problemstillinger, der vedr{\o}rer s{\ae}dskiftet. Det drejer sig is{\ae}r om s{\ae}dskiftets virkning p{\r a} jordens frugtbarhed, forsyning af afgr{\o}derne med n{\ae}ringsstoffer og betydning for forekomst af ukrudt, sygdomme og skadedyr. Der er et stort behov for en bedre koordinering af de igangv{\ae}rende aktiviteter i Europa. Dette kan EU's forskningsprogrammer forh{\r a}bentlig v{\ae}re medvirkende til at sikre.

Alle indl{\ae}ggene og konklusionerne fra m{\o}det er samlet i en rapport, som kan k{\o}bes ved henvendelse til F{\O}JO. Rapporten er p{\r a} engelsk.

	I de tidligere {\r a}r har vi benytte g{\ae}ngs praksis med at vande op til fuld markkapacitet. Nyere forskningsresultater viser dog, at det p{\r a} sandjord er meget vanskeligt at fugte jorden op igen efter en t{\o}r periode. Vandet vil have en tendens til at str{\o}mme ned i nogle enkelte "fingre" i jorden. Her kan der samtidigt ske udvaskning af is{\ae}r kv{\ae}lstof.
	Vi har derfor i {\r a}r valgt kun at vande med ca. 15 mm ved et vandunderskud p{\r a} 30 mm. Erfaringer fra andre fors{\o}g p{\r a} Jyndevad viser, at det totalt set vil kunne spare vand, uden at det g{\r a}r ud over udbyttet. Det er vores h{\r a}b, at det ogs{\r a} vil kunne medvirke til at hindre nitratudvasking i v{\ae}ksts{\ae}sonen. Denne nitratudvaskning er en af {\r a}rsagerne til at udnyttelsen af kv{\ae}lstof i husdyrg{\o}dningen her er betydeligt lavere end p{\r a} de {\o}vrige fors{\o}gssteder.

Ukrudtsbek{\ae}mpelse

Regnvejret har drillet lidt p{\r a} lerjorden p{\r a} Holeby. Her er roerne ved udgangen af maj endnu ikke radrenset. Jorden er simpelt hen for v{\r a}d. S{\r a} roerne er heller ikke blevet tyndet ud endnu. Vi har uds{\r a}et dobbelt plantetal, s{\r a} vi kan t{\r a}le at miste nogle planter, f.eks. ved skadedyrsangreb.
	P{\r a} Foulum er der meget ukrudt i v{\r a}rs{\ae}d med udl{\ae}g. Her er der ikke foretaget mekanisk ukrudtsbek{\ae}mpelse, fordi vi valgte at s{\r a} udl{\ae}gget samtidigt med kornet. Sidste {\r a}r blev udl{\ae}gget p{\r a} grund af vejret f{\o}rst s{\r a}et noget senere. Det gav en meget svag etablering af is{\ae}r kl{\o}ver, som blev udsat for h{\r a}rd konkurrence fra b{\r a}de ukrudt og afgr{\o}de. Udl{\ae}gget er i {\r a}r etableret betydeligt bedre. Der vil dog stadig v{\ae}re en del konkurrence fra ukrudtet.
	P{\r a} Jyndevad er udl{\ae}gget f{\o}rst s{\r a}et den 2. maj efter en blindstrigling og to efterf{\o}lgende ukrudtsharvninger. Her er udl{\ae}gget dog ogs{\r a} spiret godt frem, og afgr{\o}derne p{\r a} Jyndevad er generelt ikke helt s{\r a} konkurrencest{\ae}rke som p{\r a} Foulum, s{\r a} her f{\r a}r udl{\ae}gget alligevel en chance. Ogs{\r a} p{\r a} Flakkebjerg er udl{\ae}gget etableret godt og har taget ordentligt fat efter, at der er kommet regn.
	P{\r a} Jyndevad dyrkes vinterhvede og v{\r a}rhvede p{\r a} dobbelt r{\ae}kkeafstand for at g{\o}re det muligt at radrense. Det er ogs{\r a} lykkedes godt nok i vinterhveden, men i v{\r a}rhveden st{\r a}r der stadig en del hvidmelet g{\r a}sefod i kornr{\ae}kkerne. Hvor der er givet g{\o}dning ser det ud til at dette ukrudt vil have gode muligheder for at overvokse kornet. Husdyrg{\o}dningen er udbragt i s{\r a}bedet inden s{\r a}ningen. Det har desv{\ae}rre den effekt, at det g{\o}der ukrudtet mindst lige s{\r a} meget som afgr{\o}den.

Virkning af efterafgr{\o}der

Sidste {\r a}r var der alle steder en god virkning af efterafgr{\o}der p{\r a} udbytterne i v{\r a}rbyg. Merudbyttet for efterafgr{\o}der varierede fra 9 til 11 hkg/ha. P{\r a} sandjorden i Jyndevad ser der igen i {\r a}r ud til at blive en god virkning af efterafgr{\o}den. Derimod synes der at v{\ae}re en mindre effekt p{\r a} Foulum end sidste {\r a}r. Det kan h{\ae}nge sammen med, at gr{\ae}sset sidste {\r a}r blev fr{\ae}set inden pl{\o}jningen. I {\r a}r har vi sparet denne behandling og pl{\o}jet gr{\ae}sset ned direkte.
	Fr{\ae}sningen kan have haft en positiv effekt p{\r a} mineraliseringen af kv{\ae}lstof i gr{\ae}sset. Dermed kan tidspunktet for kv{\ae}lstoffets tilg{\ae}ngelighed have passet bedre til afgr{\o}dens behov. Fors{\o}g p{\r a} Foulum har vist, at fr{\ae}sning af afgr{\ae}sningsmarker forud for pl{\o}jning om for{\r a}ret kan {\o}ge udbytte og kv{\ae}lstofoptagelse i v{\r a}rbyg. Derimod har fors{\o}g med tilsvarende behandlinger p{\r a} Jyndevad ikke givet forskel. Her er m{\r a}ske igen et sted, hvor jordtypen spiller en rolle.

Two four-course rotations were compared. They had one year of grass-clover as a green manure crop, either followed by spring wheat or by winter wheat. The nitrate leaching was measured using ceramic suction cells. The nitrate leaching did not differ between the rotations, as a change in leaching following the grass-clover was compensated by a reverse effect in the grain crops. Use of cover crops reduced N leaching by 23 to 38\% at crop rotation level with the highest reduction on the coarse sandy soil. Simulation of N leaching using the FASSET model showed that a practice of using part of the summer period in the grass-clover as a bare fallow to control couch grass could increase leaching substantially, in particular on the sandy soil.},

Disse aspekter unders{\o}ges i et fors{\o}g med forskellige s{\ae}dskifter p{\r a} fire forskellige jordtyper. S{\ae}dskifterne repr{\ae}senterer systemer med forskellige andele af korn og kv{\ae}lstoffikserende afgr{\o}der. S{\ae}dskifterne afpr{\o}ves p{\r a} fire forskellige m{\r a}der, henholdsvis med og uden brug af efterafgr{\o}der og med og uden brug af husdyrg{\o}dning.

Det mest stabile og h{\o}jeste udbytter opn{\r a}edes i systemet med fangafgr{\o}de, og is{\ae}r hvor der ogs{\r a} anvendtes g{\o}dning. Udvaskningen af b{\r a}de kv{\ae}lstof og kalium viste store forskelle mellem fors{\o}gsstederne. Udvaskningen af kv{\ae}lstof var beskeden og kaliumudvaskningen kunne ignoreres p{\r a} den sandblandende lerjord p{\r a} Sj{\ae}lland og lerjorden p{\r a} Lolland. Derimod forekom der stor udvaskning af b{\r a}de kv{\ae}lstof og kalium p{\r a} den grovsandede jord p{\r a} Jyndevad og nogen udvaskning p{\r a} den lerblandede sandjord ved Foulum. Udvaskningen af kv{\ae}lstof kan begr{\ae}nses ved anvendelse af efterafgr{\o}der og kompenseres gennem dyrkning af kv{\ae}lstoffikserende afgr{\o}der. Der vil derimod v{\ae}re behov for yderligere g{\o}dskning med godkendte kaliumg{\o}dninger p{\r a} den grovsandede jord p{\r a} Jyndevad. Det er endnu for tidligt at afg{\o}re om der ogs{\r a} vil v{\ae}re et yderligere behov for g{\o}dskning med kalium p{\r a} Foulum.

Der var betydelig variation mellem fors{\o}gssteder og {\r a}r i de opn{\r a}ede udnyttelsesprocenter af kv{\ae}lstof i den tilf{\o}rte gylle. Dette kan h{\ae}nge sammen med at gyllen blev udlagt med sl{\ae}beslanger om for{\r a}ret, og ikke nedf{\ae}ldet eller nedpl{\o}jet. En s{\r a}dan nedf{\ae}ldning eller nedpl{\o}jning vil muligvis ogs{\r a} kunne medvirke til at {\o}ge afgr{\o}dens konkurrenceevne over for ukrudtet.

        abstract = {The possibilities for increasing total grain yield in organic cereal production through manipulation of crop rotation design were investigated in a field experiment on different soil types in Denmark from 1997 to 2000. Three experimental factors were included in the experiment in a factorial design: 1) proportion of grass-clover and pulses in the rotation, 2) catch crop (with and without), and 3) manure (with and without). Three four-course rotations were compared. Two of the rotations had one year of grass-clover as a green manure crop, either followed by spring wheat or by winter wheat. The grass-clover was replaced by winter cereals in the third rotation. Animal manure was applied as slurry in rates corresponding to 40\% of the nitrogen (N) demand of the cereal crops.
	Rotational grain yields of the cereal and pulse crops were calculated by summing yields for each plot over the four years in the rotation. The rotational yields were affected by all experimental factors (rotation, manure and catch crop). However, the largest effects on both dry matter and N yields were caused by differences between sites caused by differences in soils, climate and cropping history. The rotation without a green manure crop produced the greatest total yield. Dry matter and N yields in this rotation were about 10\% higher than in the rotation with a grass-clover ley in one year of four. Therefore, the yield benefits from the grass-clover ley could not compensate for the yield reduction as a result of leaving 25\% of the rotation out of production. There were no differences in dry matter and N yields in grains between the rotations, where either spring or winter cereals followed the grass-clover ley. The N use efficiency for ammonium-N in the applied manure corresponded to that obtained from N in commercial fertilizer. There were only very small yield benefits from the use of catch crops. However, this may change over time as fertility builds up in the system with catch crops.

        abstract = {The effect of nitrogen (N) supply and weeds on grain yield of spring barley was investigated in an organic farming crop rotation experiment on three different soil types in Denmark from 1997 to 2001. Three experimental factors were included in the experiment in a factorial design: 1) crop rotation (lupin or pea/barley as previous crop to barley), 2) cover crop (with and without), and 3) manure (with and without). The crop rotations included grass-clover as a green manure crop. Animal manure was applied as slurry in rates corresponding to 40\% of the N demand of the cereal crops.
	Application of 50 kg NH4-N ha-1 in manure (slurry) increased barley grain DM yield by 1.0 to 1.3 Mg DM ha-1, whereas the use of cover crops (primarily perennial ryegrass) increased grain DM yield by 0.4 to 0.7 Mg DM ha-1 with the smallest effect on the sandy loam soil and the highest effect on the coarse sandy soil. Model estimations showed that the yield reduction from weeds varied from 0.3 to 1.6 Mg DM ha-1 depending on weed species and density. The yield effects of N supply were thus more predictable and less variable than the effects of weed infestation.
	The N use efficiency of NH4-N in applied manure varied from 25 to 39\% corresponding to N use efficiencies obtained with mineral N fertilisers. The N use efficiency of above-ground weeds and cover crops sampled in November prior to the spring barley varied from 13 to 57\%. Pea/barley and lupin increased grain yield by 0.2 and 0.8 Mg DM ha-1 over winter wheat as a previous crop. This could not be explained by N in the above-ground residues of the previous crop. Grass-clover as a green manure crop three years prior to the spring barley increased grain yield by about 0.5 Mg DM ha-1 at Flakkebjerg. Cropping history was thus equally important for grain yield as manure application.

Uma forma de ressarci-los seria implementando uma pol{\'i}tica de estabiliza{\c c}{\~a}o de renda que asseguraria rentabilidade est{\'a}vel aos produtores. O objetivo deste artigo {\'e} determinar os benef{\'i}cios de uma pol{\'i}tica de estabiliza{\c c}{\~a}o de renda implementada na agricultura familiar para agricultores e consumidores de arroz, feij{\~a}o, milho e mandioca, e os custos para agricultores comerciais nesses mercados. Utilizou-se o modelo de Newbery e Stiglitz, que considera a redu{\c c}{\~a}o do risco com a pol{\'i}tica de estabiliza{\c c}{\~a}o de renda. A pol{\'i}tica implicaria aumento de receita para produtores familiares. Os benef{\'i}cios de transfer{\^e}ncia superariam os de efici{\^e}ncia para produtores familiares e consumidores. Os benef{\'i}cios para a agricultura familiar superariam os custos da agricultura comercial com a pol{\'i}tica nos mercados de feij{\~a}o, mandioca e milho, e os benef{\'i}cios totais superariam os custos totais nos mercados de feij{\~a}o e milho, ao contr{\'a}rio ocorreria nos mercados de arroz e mandioca, embora neste fosse pequena a diferen{\c c}a. Conclui-se que a implementa{\c c}{\~a}o da pol{\'i}tica seria vi{\'a}vel nos mercados onde a participa{\c c}{\~a}o da agricultura familiar fosse maior que a da comercial e naqueles importadores.}

The renaissance of rural values and food quality-related issues has brought many urban people to again approach rural areas and actors, sometimes with the intermediation of other more or less professional actors. In an EU share cost project TRUC (EU-QoL:QLAM-2001-00025; 2001-2003), several cases of regional and rural development throughout Europe have been analysed on the topic of transforming rural communication.
We present three of these cases in northern Germany: the Model Region Luebeck Bay, Organic Milk and Nature Protection. All of these projects are located in an area where urbanization and the multifunctionality of rural action and development is highly developed. 
The general objective of the project was to consolidate a transdisciplinary and transsectoral approach to the problem of communication in rural areas, to raise awareness among practitioners and academics of the specificities of rural communication and of the principles of ?progressive rural communication? and to build a core network of academics and practitioners around this topic. 
The project has an essentially exploratory function, so its achievements will be the basis for further research agendas and projects. The general objective is articulated into three specific objectives:
- Accumulating information on rural communication
- Creating new knowledge on rural communication
- Turning new knowledge into practice
The fulfilment of this objective will allow all actors involved in rural development to make decisions with more awareness of the importance of rural communication and to embody this awareness into rural development projects and practices.}

growth, nutrient composition of leaves and variation of soil nutrient element composition in the province of Erzurum, Turkey. The results showed
that Bacillus M3 treatment stimulated plant growth and resulted in significant yield increase. Inoculation of raspberry plant roots and rhizosphere

raspberry leaves with OSU-142 + M3 treatment, and Fe and Mn contents of the leaves of raspberry with M3 and OSU-142 + M3 applications
significantly improved under organic growing conditions. Bacterial applications also significantly effected soil total N, available P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe,

The assessment is made in close relation to the stakeholders that have been determined. This assessment is based on current available knowledge which does not differentiate between organic and conventional management.Net farm income on conventional dairy farms introducing AMS does not increase significantly,neither is this expected for organic AMS farms. The time saving effect results in social but not economic advantages. Introduction of AMS on conventional farms in combination with grazing,results in a small increase in fossil energy use per kg milk, and an increase in eutrophication perha farm area due to less efficient use of total grazing area. Similar results are to be expected fororganic AMS dairy farms. Introduction of AMS does not result in animal health problems forconventional farms, and is not expected to result in problems for organic farms. Concerning cowwelfare, the relation between use of AMS and grazing required in organic production is essential.
Milk quality decreases due to the introduction of AMS at conventional farms, and might have asimilar effect at organic farms. Farmers?, consumers? and other defined stakeholders? perceptions of the selected sustainability aspects have hardly been investigated. Conventional farmers express satisfaction when asked after having invested in AMS. It is crucial to communicate with stakeholders about the different aspects of innovative technology and even more important to organic consumers that show major concern for product quality, ecology and animal welfare.},

contribution of an Automatic Milking System (AMS) to sustainable development of
organic dairy production in Denmark and the Netherlands. In addition, reasons for
the current difference in AMS use on organic dairy farms between both countries
were explored. To answer above mentioned aims, farmers and advisors in both
countries were interviewed using a focus group approach. Questions of the interviews
were based on a literature review on sustainability issues affected by introduction of
AMS. Participants expressed no moral problems regarding AMS use. They, however,
pointed out uncertainty about the economic gain, difficulties with grazing,
adaptation problems to technology, and image problems towards consumers. The
latter results from a reduction in grazing time affecting both animal welfare and
product quality. The participants did not recognize eutrophication, as result of high
stocking density on farmstead lots, as a problem caused by AMS. The milk quality
problem related to AMS use, although acknowledged as crucial towards consumers,
was not prioritized very highly, especially not by the farmers in both countries. All
groups were, however, unanimous in their perception of how important image was as
far as the consumers are concerned. The perception analysis revealed that Dutch
participants were more concerned about the economic payoff of AMS use, and
showed more reluctance towards enlargement than Danish ones. In addition, they
acknowledged the small-scale naturalness of organic production. These differences in
perception could possibly explain observed differences in AMS use in organic dairy
production between Denmark and the Netherlands.},

The theme included sessions in related to the ongoing revision of the EU regulation. The sessions for this theme were the 2nd stakeholder workshop of the Organic Revision Project.

This report contains a short summary of all sessions that are directly relevant to the theme. Annex 1 includes the programme of the sessions in this theme. The first session (Session A 1-2-3) was the opening sub-plenary for the broader Topic 1 of Sustainable Rural Development, which included the Theme 3. In this session, a representative from the Organic Farming Unit in DG Agriculture of the European Commission introduced the proposal for a new European regulation for organic farming. The second session (B3) had the main purpose of proving a forum for discussion of the Commission proposal for total revision of 2092/91 from December 2005 with presentation of two different stakeholders and ongoing work in the Organic Revision Project. The third session (C3) presented ongoing work in WP 2 of the Organic Revision project in relation to the case study of the question of local food and regionality, alongside work from other researchers on the same themes. Session D3 focused on flexibility and regional variation in the standards and included one presentation with a first analysis of entries in the organic the Organic Rules Database, conclusions from the SAFO network about livestock standards in relation to regional diversity and a presentation from DG Agriculture of the European commission about flexibility in organic standards, regional differences. The final session on intensification and conventionalisation of the organic food and farming sector also is relevant to ongoing work in WP2 and included one presentation on the IFOAM process of formulating its principles of organic agriculture and two papers examining whether or not there are any indications of conventionalisation of organic producers in Europe.},

How can (or does) farmers? learning help to make such changes? What support measures can (or do) facilitate such learning? To answer such questions, a UK study identified farmers undergoing an agroecological transition and compared their practices with two prevalent models. As regards the Efficiency ? Substitution ? Redesign (ESR) model, our case-study farms had all three changes, but they were rarely sequential; agroecosystem redesign did not follow from Efficiency or Substitution measures, which readily provide endpoints rather than transitional stages. As regards the ?trigger events? model ? Trigger, Active Assessment and Implementation ? the three stages were often overlapping; triggers arose only when farmers? interpreted difficulties or opportunities as grounds to implement changes, which they had generally considered beforehand. More fundamentally, case-study farmers were unlearning conventional expectations by undergoing cognitive and affective shifts. Together those two models (ESR and trigger events) can provide heuristic devices for identifying farmers? agroecological trajectories in their diverse forms. Going further, better models of farmers? learning and action will be necessary for facilitating agroecological transitions and guiding relevant support measures.}

        abstract = {The term agroecology is used mainly to describe an approach ?emphasising ecological principles and practices in the design and management of agroecosystems, one that
integrates the long-term protection of natural resources as an element of food, fuel and fibre production? (Lampkin et al., 2015, P9). Agroecological approaches in farming can make a major contribution to the sustainable intensification of agriculture in the UK but there is no specific policy framework for ?agroecology? in the UK. 
Building on a previous builds on the LUPG report by Lampkin et al. (2015) on the contribution of agroecology to sustainable intensification the report present a short background section, the approach, results and conclusion.}

(i) identify motivations, challenges and opportunities encountered, together with the perceived benefits and disadvantages associated with the transition and 
(ii) gain an understanding of individuals? trajectories in context, including social, economic, biophysical, cultural and psychological dimensions. 
Fourteen farmers in England, Scotland and Wales that had undergone an agroecological transition were interviewed in early 2017 using a semi-structured interview case study approach. Answers were analysed, considering mainly two theoretical models of farmers? decision-making.
Key triggers were farmers newly taking over a business or feeling inspired by meeting agroecological farmers. Farmers? biggest challenges included issues related to people, technical issues, financial and organic regulations. State support measures were often mis-matched to the farmer?s approach which deterred some farmers from submitting applications.}

The results show  a wide variation in support rates and policies  between EU member states that these have the potential to influence significantly the competitive position of producers within the European organic market. The development of the organic sector is influenced by external factors and by the effective combination of various support policies. },

Este trabalho resgata o significado do termo desenvolvimento sustent{\'a}vel e salienta as diferentes ideologias impl{\'i}citas em duas correntes de pensamento, a ecotecnocr{\'a}tica e a ecossocial. A partir da an{\'a}lise destes enfoques de desenvolvimento, observa-se a insustentabilidade da agricultura convencional e destacam-se os princ{\'i}pios da Agroecologia no processo de constru{\c c}{\~a}o de estilos de agricultura sustent{\'a}vel. Nessa perspectiva, aborda-se a utiliza{\c c}{\~a}o de sistemas agroflorestais como estrat{\'e}gia para a promo{\c c}{\~a}o do desenvolvimento rural sustent{\'a}vel. Com base na revis{\~a}o bibliogr{\'a}fica s{\~a}o analisados tr{\^e}s projetos de sistemas agroflorestais na agricultura familiar em distintos biomas brasileiros. Conclui-se que estes projetos possuem caracter{\'i}sticas que podem ser potencializadas enquanto alternativas de desenvolvimento, apresentando resultados positivos n{\~a}o apenas em rela{\c c}{\~a}o a prote{\c c}{\~a}o ambiental, mas tamb{\'e}m no que diz respeito a ganhos econ{\^o}mico e melhorias sociais da popula{\c c}{\~a}o envolvida.}

We focused on grain samples of common wheat and durum wheat grown using synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, animal manures, or green manures from nitrogen-fixing legumes. The
measurement of amino acid {\ensuremath{\delta}}15N and {\ensuremath{\delta}}13C values, after protein hydrolysis and derivatization, was carried out using gas chromatography?combustion?isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS). Our results demonstrated that {\ensuremath{\delta}}13C of glutamic acid and glutamine in particular, but also the combination of {\ensuremath{\delta}}15N and {\ensuremath{\delta}}13C of 10 amino acids, can improve the discrimination between conventional and organic wheat compared to stable isotope bulk tissue analysis. We concluded that compound-specific stable isotope analysis of amino acids represents a novel analytical tool with the potential to support and improve the certification
and control procedures in the organic sector.},

        abstract = {Animal welfare has attracted widespread attention worldwide in recent times including within the conventional systems of intensive production in industrialized countries. It can be assessed in a number of ways, also, the yardstick of welfare may differ from people to people and region to region since OIE is only now considering development of more science-based internationally acceptable criteria for animal welfare. In this study, the organic livestock production standards, developed inter alia, the Government of India (GOI) under its National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP), were used to assess the practices being followed at farmers' level in India. Organic production standards are supposed to keep animal welfare as one of the top most requirements with no compromise on welfare issues. A micro-level study was conducted in Bankura district (22038?N-23038?N and 86036?E-87046?E) in India with 50 tribal and 50 non-tribal farmers practicing mixed crop-livestock farming. The farmers (average landholding 1.02 ha, average herd size 4.02 cattle equivalent), were asked about several animal welfare criteria including those for draft animals. It was found that almost all farmers, either, tribal or non-tribal provide shelter to animals against extreme weather conditions. Ninety percent of the farmers provided immediate treatment to sick animals and none of the farmers used sick animals at work. However, 26.46\% of non tribals beat their animals at work. Nine point eighty-five percent of farmers confessed that they sometimes overload their animals. The average duration of work in summer, rainy season and winter was found to be 5.27 h, 7.09 h and 5 h, respectively. In the study, it was found that the welfare standards were well cared of though farmers were not organic per se, nor they have had any specific training or programme on animal welfare measures. It is recommended that the organic animal standards may be used as the yardstick to measure animal welfare even in conventional non-organic forms of livestock production systems as is demonstrated in the current study.}

        abstract = {The 2nd edition (1929) was arguably the most influential edition of Rudolf Steiner?s ?Agriculture Course?. It was issued to members of the Experimental Circle of Anthroposophical Farmers and Gardeners under a non disclosure agreement (NDA). It appears that the original print run of the 2nd edition was not exhausted until c. 1948. This presentation is a preliminary report and the first public disclosure of a singular document. These notes of Guenther Wachsmuth (1893-1963), the editor of the ?Agriculture Course?, have recently been discovered. Bound into a single volume are the editor?s copyedits (c. 310; including insertions, deletions \& substitutions) of the 1st edition, fresh material for the 2nd edition including handwritten front matter (n=8 pp, ss), handwritten end matter (n=20 pp, ss), original drawings in colour (n=8 pp, ss), and typed index for the 2nd edition (n=20 pp, ds). This bespoke ?1.5? edition of the ?Agriculture Course? (between the first undated edition, circa 1926, and the 2nd edition, dated 1929) reveals Wachsmuth?s intentions for the second edition of the ?Agriculture Course?.

        abstract = {Historically, Europe has been the locus of key developments in the founding and growth of organic agriculture. A century ago, in 1924, the Austrian New Age philosopher Dr. Rudolf Steiner called for an agriculture differentiated from the prevailing direction of agriculture and one reliant on natural biological processes rather than synthetic chemicals. The European Union (EU) has set the goal to be of 25\% organic by 2030. Organic agriculture presently accounts for 9.6\% of EU agriculture (cf. the world figure is 1.6\%).
For the past two decades, the tally of EU organic agriculture hectares has grown at 6.7\% pa to reach 15,639,063 ha (cf. the world total of 76,403,777 ha). At this historic rate of growth (of 6.7\% pa), organics will account for 17.5\% by 2030 (c. 28.2 m ha), which is well short of the goal. To reach 25\% by 2030, the growth rate needs to be ramped up to 10.7\% pa growth (and reach a total of 40.6 m ha). About half (n = 15) of the 31 countries committed to the 25\% goal, comprising the EU, EEA, and EFTA, have more than 10\% organic agriculture. That offers a good foundation on which to build to the goal. The other half (n = 16) each have less than 10\% organic agriculture; they offer opportunities for substantial uptake of organics. The EU has a ?Farm to Fork? strategy (F2F) with an ?Action Plan? comprising three ?Axes? and 54 ?Actions? to achieve the 25\% organic goal by 2030; however, milestones and waypoints are lacking. The EU goal is bold, but not as bold as the 100\% organic goals of Sikkim, which has achieved its 100\% goal, and Bhutan, which has not, and is stalled at 1\% organic.},

        abstract = {A century ago the New Age philosopher Dr Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) called for the development of a differentiated. agriculture, one focussed on biology rather than chemistry. At his Agriculture Course at Koberwitz (now Kobierzyce), in the summer of 1924, Steiner founded the Experimental Circle of Anthroposophical Farmers and Gardeners. The Experimental Circle members each signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). Their task was to test Steiner?s ideas, establish what worked, and to publish the results. That injunction was arguably satisfied by the publication of Ehrenfried Pfeiffer?s book ?Bio-Dynamic Farming and Gardening? in 1938. The results reported in the present paper are Experimental Circle results that were subject to the secrecy provisions of the NDA at that time (1936), and are now finally revealed. Immanuel Voegele (1897-1959) recorded yields for five crops under Biodynamic (BD) management in the years 1931-1933, comparing these results to yields in the pre-BD years 1920-1926. He reported yield increases for potatoes to 55\%, rye up to 48\%, oats to 31\%, wheat to 14\%, and barley to 9\%. Voegele was well credentialed and grounded to report on Biodynamics. He had studied agriculture at Stuttgart, he attended the Agricultural Course of Rudolf Steiner at Koberwitz, and he was an inaugural member of the Experimental Circle. Voegele had served as a farm manager at the Koberwitz estate of Count Carl Keyserlingk (1869-1928) (until 1925). He subsequently worked at the Biodynamic farm of Ernst Stegemann (1882-1943) at Marienstein. The present paper reports longitudinal yield results for five crops at Voegele?s farm at Pilgramshain, Silesia, Germany, before and after the conversion to BD. These early BD yield data were shared amongst ?the faithful? at the time, and only now publicly. From the high point of his reported successes with BD, life and prospects for Voegele would rapidly deteriorate. The Nazi regime was hostile to Rudolf Steiner, Anthroposophy, and Anthroposophic ventures (of which Biodynamics was one). All books by Rudolf Steiner were banned by the Nazis in 1935 (including the Agriculture Course). Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and slaughtered millions of Polish civilians, before eventually in 1945 the Russian Army routed the Nazi army. The Russians marched on ?Fortress Breslau? and on to Berlin, sparking a mass westward exodus of Germans, including Immanuel Voegele. Territory, including Pilgramshain, was relinquished to Poland at the Potsdam Conference of 1945. Immanuel Voegele?s legacy of reported successes with Biodynamics at a time when secrecy prevailed is now shared.},

        abstract = {Bhutan is a poor country with 51\% of the population employed in agriculture, and little manufacturing. Forests accounts for 71\% of Bhutan, and agriculture 8\%. The average landholding is 1.4 hectares per household. Many farmers practice ?traditional? farming using forest litter and farm yard manure. The inputs for chemical agriculture (synthetic fertilisers and pesticides) are generally imported and expensive. Bhutan announced a goal of 100\% organic agriculture in 2006. Looking after the environment and animal welfare, and not poisoning insects and other living things are precepts congruent with Buddhism, the national religion of Bhutan. So, organic agriculture appears to be a ?good fit? for Bhutan. Yet, nearly two decades after declaring the 100\% goal, there appears to have been near zero progress based on the parameter of certified organic agriculture. Longitudinal data of organic agriculture hectares for the past two decades reveal that the goal of 100\% appears to be wishful thinking, with the reality of 1.09\% organic agriculture. In the meantime, a neighbouring Indian state of India, Sikkim, with many geographic, climatic and demographic comparables, has achieved its goal of 100\% organic. Sikkim is a blueprint of how to achieve 100\% organic, while Bhutan is a blueprint for how not to (so far).},

He was an Anthroposophist with a 375 acre (150 hectares) mixed farm at Marienstein, midway between Frankfurt and Hamburg, Germany. Stegemann attended the Agriculture Course at Koberwitz (now Kobierzyce, Poland) in June 1924 at which the New Age philosopher, Dr Rudolf Steiner (1861?1925), laid the historical foundations for biodynamic and organic farming. Stegemann was a founding member of the Experimental Circle of Anthroposophical Farmers and Gardeners which was founded by Steiner during the Koberwitz course. Prior to the Course, Steiner gave Stegemann some preliminary insights on agricultural practice. Steiner?s injunction to the farmers and gardeners of the Experimental Circle was to test his ?hints? for a new and then un-named agriculture, to establish what works, and then to publish the results, and thereby bring the ?era of secrecy? to a close. Until that point, members of the Circle were to maintain confidentiality of the Course and experiments. The present paper reveals some of the earliest results of putting Steiner?s indications to the test. For Stegemann, over eight years, the annual yield for sugar beet show increases using Biodynamics of up to 26\% (compared to the base year of 1923). The annual yield for ?cereals? show increases using Biodynamics of up to 42\% (compared to the base year of 1923). Stegemann?s longitudinal yield data were presented in June 1931 to Experimental Circle members, under constraints of confidentiality, at his farm at Marienstein (in the then Province of Hanover; now in the German state of Lower Saxony), and now appear unbridled from those constraints of confidentiality.},

        abstract = {Kent was ground-zero for the concept of organic farming. Amidst the pandemonium of World War II, Kent farmer and estate owner, Lord Northbourne (Walter James) (1896-1982) published ?Look to the Land? (30 May, 1940). The book introduced to the world, the term ?organic farming? along with the philosophy and rationale of practice. Northbourne?s terminology and philosophy were rapidly adopted and championed globally, notably in the USA by the publishing entrepreneur Jerome Rodale (1898-1971) and in Australia by the grazier Colonel Harold (Bill) White (1883-1971) and the Australian Organic Farming \& Gardening Society. Organic agriculture is now a worldwide phenomenon which is reported from 186 countries, and globally accounts for 71 million hectares of farmland and GBP86 billion of retail sales per annum. A multinational sequence of events led to Northbourne's 1940 manifesto of organic agriculture. In 1924 the Austrian New Age philosopher Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) presented his Agriculture Course at Koberwitz (now Kobierzyce, Poland). In 1938 the German chemist and acolyte of Steiner, Ehrenfried Pfeiffer (1899-1961), working in Switzerland, published his ?Biodynamic Farming and Gardening?. Northbourne was keen to introduce these ideas to a British audience. He visited Pfeiffer in Switzerland in January 1939 to recruit him to present a conference on Biodynamics at Northbourne?s farm in Kent. The outcome was the Betteshanger Biodynamics Conference (1-9 July, 1939), with lecturers from Switzerland and Holland, and attendees from Britain and New Zealand. Northbourne recalled ?the spirit of friendliness, happiness and unity which prevailed ? for nine days the possibility of war was scarcely alluded to; things more real and more constructive absorbed attention?. With the outbreak of war (1 September, 1939), the appetite of the British public for Germanic ideas was extinguished. Northbourne?s response was to create his manifesto of organic agriculture where he pitted a contest between ?organic and chemical farming?. He stripped out the esoterica and arcane Anthroposophical language of Steiner and Pfeiffer?s biodynamics and presented a compelling case for what he termed ?organic agriculture?. Northbourne was described by a colleague as ?a man of great vision, decisiveness, quiet humour and kindly authority ? who brought to every facet of his widely ranging life a rare sense of harmony and balanced purpose ? he was a widely read man of very considerable scholarship with deep philosophical understanding?. Northbourne?s agricultural ideas have stood the test of time.}

Most  of the synthetic nitrogenous fertilizer of the past century, and right up to the present, has been manufactured using the Haber-Bosch process. The use of synthetic fertilizers has led to significant negative environmental outcomes. Rudolf Steiner was an early voice against chemical agriculture. Steiner's Agriculture Course of 1924 led to the development and world-wide proliferation of Bio-dynamic Agriculture, a farming system which has always championed the biological fixation of nitrogen by soil micro-organisms. This paper identifies ten key differences between biological and Haber-Bosch chemical fixation of nitrogen. },

The essence of Trophiobiosis theory is that pests shun healthy plants, pesticides weaken plants, and weakened plants are more open to pests and disease, and hence pesticides precipitate pest attack and disease susceptibility and thus induce a cycle of further pesticide use. }

        abstract = {Readers of narratives of the history of organic farming in Australia will be familiar with such accounts beginning in the "1980s". In questing after the earliest organic farming society, and more particularly in pursuing the spread of the "organic" meme  from its 1940 birth in Britain, it was therefore a great surprise to uncover the Australian Organic Faming and Gardening Society (AOFGS) founded in October 1944. This appears to be the world's first "organic farming" association. It also resets the organic clock for Australia back by four decades. Here was an association, pre-dating the UK Soil Association by two years, formed half a world away from the birthplace of "organic", in a country at war, under food rationing, and with its workforce under Manpower regulations. Yet organic farming principles were clearly articulated by this Society, perhaps as clearly articulated as they have ever been, and particularised for Australia. The Society was constrained from publishing their journal due to wartime constraints on paper. The first appearance of the Organic Farming Digest (OFD) was in April 1946. Thereafter, for nearly a decade, the Society regularly published a journal, with the last issue appearing in 1954. This paper explores the Society; its principles; its journals; its people; its interactions with key organic figures of the time including Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, Eve Balfour, Albert Howard, and Jerome Rodale; its Australian contributors from five  states,  including Colonel Harold White and Professor Sir Stanton Hicks; its progress and ultimately its demise; and touch on how this history became lost.}

This is the essence of Trophobiosis Theory, a thesis presented by Francis Chaboussou, an agronomist of the France?s National Institute of Agricultural Research (INRA), in ?Healthy Crops: A New Agricultural Revolution?. After two decades, this important book is finally available in English.

Plant pathologist Chaboussou (b.1908 - d.1985) saw with a clear eye that just as there are iatrogenic, doctor-caused, medical problems, likewise there are agrogenic, farmer-caused, agricultural problems. Chaboussou offers a lifetime?s insight into his vision for an agriculture without pesticides, and in so doing he offers a scientific underpinning for organic and bio-dynamic agriculture.

        abstract = {Fifty Nordic pioneers of biodynamic (BD) agriculture, and hence of organic agriculture, are identified. These individuals, from Norway (n = 23), Sweden (n = 12), Denmark  (n = 10), and Finland (n = 5), joined the Experimental Circle of Anthroposophical Farmers and Gardeners in the years 1924?1946. These pioneers comprised both men (n = 35) and women (n = 14), with one member of undetermined gender. The Experimental Circle was headquartered at the Goetheanum, Dornach, Switzerland. One of these pioneers (Anna Wager Gunnarson) attended the foundational course of biodynamic and organic agriculture, presented by Dr Rudolf Steiner (1861?1925), in eight lectures at Koberwitz (now Kobierzyce, Poland) in June 1924. The core element of the course was that agriculture was properly a biological rather than a chemical pursuit. The ?Agriculture Course? was subsequently issued (in German from 1926) as a subscriber-only published book to members (of the Anthroposophical Society) who joined the Experimental Circle. Each Circle member signed a non disclosure agreement (NDA) and committed to testing the ideas of the course. A milestone was the 1938 book by Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, ?Bio-Dynamic Farming and Gardening,? which arguably released Experimental Circle members from their NDA. Nordic members joined progressively over the two decades following the Koberwitz course, with new memberships peaking in 1932 (n = 7), and continuing through the years of World War II (WWII). Biodynamic agriculture is still practiced in the Nordic countries of these pioneers, with Denmark presently accounting for 2,998 hectares, Sweden 873 ha, Norway 548 ha, and Finland 384 ha. The Nordic countries have developed strong organic sectors, with Sweden accounting for 610 543 ha of certified organic agriculture (which is 20.2\% of its agricultural land), Finland 315 112 ha (14.4\%), Denmark 299 998 (11.4\%), and Norway 45 181 ha (4.6\%). Iceland has no identified BD pioneers, presently no BD hectars, and 6 440 ha of organic agriculture (0.4\% of total agriculture land). The identification of the 50 Nordic pioneers of the present paper provides recognition as early-adopters and invites further research on their life, legacy, and role in founding BD and organic agriculture in the region.},

The Austrian New Age philosopher, Dr Rudolf Steiner, presented his Agriculture Course in the village of Koberwitz, Germany (now Kobierzyce, Poland) in the summer of 1924. The course of eight lectures laid the foundations for the emergence, over the following two decades, of biodynamic farming and organic agriculture. There were 111 attendees at the course at Koberwitz, many were farmers, all were Anthroposophists. The Agriculture Course was presented in German. It was one of the final lecture series that Rudolf Steiner conducted in his lifetime. It was a course of what Rudolf Steiner called ?hints?, to be put to the test, not prescriptions nor dogmas. The Agriculture Course appeared in print in German in 1926. It was initially available only to members of the Experimental Circle of Anthroposophic Farmers and Gardeners (until some time after WW2). Members of the Experimental Circle agreed to test Rudolf Steiner?s ideas with the view to the publication of the results. The first translation of the Agriculture Course appeared in English in 1929. That translation was by George Kaufmann (later known as George Adams) who brought to the task his years of masterfully and extemporaneously rendering into English Rudolf Steiner?s lectures in German for audiences. The Agriculture Course has been translated into a further 14 (at least) other languages: French (1943); Swedish (1966); Italian (1973); Danish (1976); Dutch (1977); Spanish (1988); Hebrew (1989); Norwegian (1992); Romanian (1997); Russian (1997); Serbian (2004); Portuguese (2005); Polish (2007); and Esperanto (2009).

The present paper identifies for the first time the 111 attendees of that course. The list reveals that ?Koberwitzers?, as they called themselves, were a well credentialed and capable group of individuals, some of whom went on to champion and develop Rudolf Steiner?s ideas about agriculture and other fields. The present paper revises a prior analysis of the Koberwitzers. For each Koberwitzer, the list reveals, the name, hometown, occupation, and accommodation during the course. Thirty one percent of Koberwitzers were women. Thirty eight percent were associated directly with agriculture (including farmer, estate manager, and estate owner), 6\% of attendees were creatives (including writer, author, artist and editor), and a further 6\% were priests. These three occupational categories, viz. Agriculture, Creative and Priest, together account for 50\% of Koberwitzer occupations (and 72\% of the known occupations). There remains for further scholarship to populate gaps in the listing: the gender of one Koberwitzer remains unidentified; one hometown (and country) remains unidentified; 33 occupations remain unidentified; and 51 accommodations remain unidentified. At the time of the Koberwitz course, Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) was mortally ill. The course was never repeated,. It was up to the Koberwitzers to progress Rudolf Steiner?s call for the development of a differentiated natural agriculture without synthetic chemicals. The Koberwitzers met the call. There are now 251,842 certified biodynamic hectares in 55 countries, included in the 71,514,583 certified organic hectares in 186 countries.},

There is a battle raging in South Australia for the integrity of its agricultural sector. SA is a world leader in organic agriculture. It accounts for 20\% of the world?s certified organic agriculture hectares - SA is Australia?s leading state for organics. It capital, Adelaide, hosts the world?s largest organics certifier (NASAA). There are no genetically modified crops grown in SA. There has been a GMO (genetically modified organisms) Moratorium in SA for the past two decades (beginning in 2003). While Australia is a giant in organics (accounting for 51\% of world certified organic hectares), it is a minnow in the world of GMOs (accounting for 0.4\% of the world?s GMO hectares). Despite the natural advantages of SA for producing clean and green and natural food, the incumbent government appears ?hell bent? on dismantling the successful and popular SA GMO Moratorium. Most Australians (90\%) do not regard GMOs as ?safe?, and they may be right. But, whether they are right or wrong, or just right to be cautious, in the market place consumers will vote with their dollars. Globally, consumers avoid purchasing GMOs. The SA GMO Moratorium is in place due to an Act of Parliament. There are two ways to dismantle it, by Regulation or by an Act of Parliament. Regulations can be interposed to subvert the intention of the Act. This can be regarded as shoddy governance since there is no mandatory Parliamentary oversight nor debate (Gazetted Regulations are only debated if there is a disallowance motion tabled). Alternatively, an Act can be changed by Parliament. The incumbent Liberal (i.e. conservative) government of SA, led by Steven Marshall, appears to have a very tenuous grasp on the concept of ?democracy?. There is no mandate to dismantle the SA GMO Moratorium, but that is what they are trying for. There was a review of the GMO Moratorium and the majority (78\%) of submissions supported the continuance of the Moratorium.}

General Motors recently wielded the axe on the Holden brand in Australia. Sovereignty for Holden had long ago been ceded to Detroit, USA, and, the company in Australia had persisted in ignoring consumer sentiment by promoting sedans (Commodores) long after consumer demand had moved on to SUVs (sports utility vehicles). With a GMO Moratorium, SA maintains sovereignty of its foodscape. Without a GMO Moratorium, the shots are ceded to Dusseldorf (Bayer \& Monsanto), Basel and Beijing (Syngenta \& ChemChina). Global consumer surveys reveal that consumers do not want GMOs on their plate (e.g. 60\% of Chinese consumers say no to GMOs). Germany, Switzerland and China exclude their own GMO companies from selling and growing their own GMO products in their home countries. So, these GMO/pesticide companies seek far away ?mindless jurisdictions? which will allow their products. Australia has 51\% of the world?s certified organic agriculture hectares, and just 0.4\% of the world?s GMO hectares. SA is a world leader in Organics and accounts for 40\% of the certified organic agriculture hectares of Australia. The SA GMO Moratorium safeguards this important premium sector. GMO crops are ?bargain basement? crops that sell at a price penalty (e.g. 7.2\% price penalty for WA GM canola). There is no way of containing or recalling GMOs. Once released into the environment they knit themselves into the genetic fabric of the foodscape, without any mechanism for recall. Most Australian consumers think that GMO foods are unsafe (90\% in a recent survey survey), they may be right. There is at present a point of difference that Australia has from USA, also a major food exporter. Food in Australian supermarkets is non-GMO - mandated GMO labelling means that Australian food manufacturers and retailers exclude GMOs. There is no means for effectively segregating GMO crops and nor for avoiding contaminating non-GMO farms. The sensible decision for the Parliament of South Australia is to leave the SA GMO Moratorium in place.},

Despite the veneer of social validity that regulators cast, the GMO sector has failed to gain a social licence. Where GM labelling is required, food manufacturers avoid GM ingredients. GMOs have failed to gain price parity with their non-GM counterparts, and they attract price penalties. Segregation of GMOs and non-GMOs has failed (with a tolerance of 0.9\% GM contamination in so-called non-GM canola). GM has failed the coexistence test with a GMO growers contaminating neighbouring farms. GMOs are a biosecurity fail, with test plots of GM canola planted in the late 1990s still monitored two decades later for rogue canola plants. Most GMO crops are glyphosate dependent. Glyphosate is globally subject to massive litigation claims and awards, and is implicated in the causation of multiple cancers. Mechanisms for compensating farms contaminated by GMOs are lacking. The GMO industry has taken no responsibility for contaminations. GMOs are a threat to the organic sector and the maintenance of certification and price premiums. Most countries (88\%) do not grow GMO crops. This paper considers the global experience of GMOs and the Australian experience as a microcosm of the global experience and as a case study.},

It has only two rooms but it must be fairly comfortable, as Ernesto invited [Alfred] Meebold [1863-1952] to lodge with him for his future visit for the Melbourne group?. Ernesto Genoni had spent 1924 at the Goetheanum under the tutelage of Rudolf Steiner in both art and spiritual science. Ernesto recalled: I started in a small way to work a farm on Dr Steiner?s bio-dynamic methods in association with Fred Genoni?. Ernesto was the first Australian to join Rudolf Steiner?s Experimental Circle of Anthroposophic Farmers and Gardeners (in 1928). Ernesto subsequently embarked on an extensive study tour of Experimental Circle farms in Europe, visiting the leading practitioners of biodynamics: ?In 1930 I went to Dornach again to become acquainted with the BD farming. [Ehrenfried] Pfeiffer ? [Erika] Riese ? Count Lerchenfeld ? [Ernst] Stegemann at Marienh{\"o}he ? [Erhard] Bartsch near Berlin, [Max] Schwarz near Bremen ? London [Carl] Mirbt ? Pfeiffer farm at Rosendahl [Netherlands]?. The fate of the 80 acre Dalmore Farm was settled by the floods of 1934 which extinguished the hopes for this first BD venture in Victoria. The December 1934 flood was the ?largest flood on record?. Ernesto went on to establish another biodynamic farm, Demeter Farm (1934-1954).}

A scholarly work on the life and times of Alfred Howard would be welcome, but this is not that book either. The author writes of Howard ?gaining his PhD from Cambridge University?. This is incorrect. Howard graduated with a BA from Cambridge University in 1899. He did not write a dissertation. He claimed an MA because BA graduates of Cambridge are entitled to an MA after the lapse of some years after matriculation, without any further study (cam.ac.uk). In the Bibliography, Barton incorrectly cites: ?Howard, Albert. The Waste Products of Agriculture: Their Utilization as Humus. Oxford, 1931?. There is a co-author of this book, Yeshwant D. Wad (1931). In the Bibliography, Barton cites a non-existent title: ?Howard, Albert. The Soil and Health: A Study of Organic Agriculture. London, 1947?. Barton?s book is not what the title purports it to be. In addition, it is riddled with errors, some of omission, some of commission. As for Albert Howard, he was, in his later life, a champion of composting, but composting is not a metonym for organic farming.}

The proposed regulations, if they are not disallowed by the Australian Parliament, will water down the definition of GMOs in Australia, will have Australia applying definitions of GMOs that are different from major trading partners, and they risk damaging the clean and green export reputation of Australia's food and agriculture sectors. The GM proposed deregulation would be bad science and bad deregulation. Australia is a minnow in the world of GMOs, accounting for just 0.4\% of the global GMO agricultural hectares (Australian organic agriculture accounts for 51\% of global organic agriculture). GMOs account for just 0.2\% of Australia?s agricultural hectares (organic accounts for 8.8\%). Food shoppers of the world reject GM food, led by Chinese consumers of whom 60\% reject GM food. OGTR figures reveal that only 10\% of Australians agree with the proposition that GMOs are ?safe?. GMOs require labelling in Australia, and a direct consequence is that there are no GM food products on Australian supermarket shelves. The global GMO industry is founded on the lie of ?substantial equivalence? where GM proponents insist to regulators that their GMO is the ?same? as the organism from which it is derived, but to the Patent Office that their GMO is ?novel, unique, different, and a real invention? and that it thereby warrants patent protection. Recent failures of deregulation, including London?s Grenfell Tower, Melbourne?s Lacrosse Apartments, and Sydney?s Opal Tower, highlight the follies of deregulation, and the reality that deregulation privatises profits and socialises costs. The case has not been made for deregulating of GMO in Australia, and there are substantial uncalibrated costs, risks and downsides for Australia?s food and agriculture exports industry. The proposed regulations ought to be disallowed.},

        abstract = {TThe latest statistics reveal that Australia now has more certified organic agriculture hectares than the rest of the world put together. Organics is a major success story for Australia and the achievement of global majority (51\%) is an important organics milestone. Organic agriculture is reported from 181 countries. Australia reported 35,645,038 certified organic hectares and the world total is 69,845,243 hectares. Australia has been the world leader in organics, based on certified organic hectares, since global statistics of organics were first collated and published in 2000. In the two decades since then, global organics has grown at 12\% per annum (pa), year on year, while Australian organics has grown at 16\% pa. This growth in Australia has ramped up to 22\% for the past five years. In Australia this has been achieved without government support and without institutional support. Australia is at no risk of being ?knocked off the perch? anytime soon. In second position is Argentina with 3,385,827 hectares, less than 10\% of Australia?s tally. Third is China with 3,023,000 hectares, then comes Spain with 2,082,173 ha, then USA with 2,031,318 ha. Of eight states and territories in Australia, all report some organics. The states in the lead are South Australia and Queensland. Of the country?s agricultural land, 8.8\% is certified organic, so there is still plenty of room for improvement. Organic agriculture produces premium products that attract a price premium in the market, whether at home or abroad. At the present rate of growth Australia can be expected to shortly join the ?10\% Club?, along with the leaders Liechtenstein (37.9\%), Samoa (37.6\%), Austria (24.0\%), Estonia (20.5\%), and ten others. The market for Australian organic produce is mostly driven by the world?s appetite for clean and nutritious food, ultimately that means by discerning consumers with the wherewithal to pay the organic premium. Meanwhile, the world?s consumers are becoming more informed, more discerning, more health conscious, and more wealthy. No one would eat glyphosated food if they had a choice, which is to say, an informed choice. The prospects for global and Australian organics are good.}

Crop Moratorium (Anderson, 2019) reveals that the so-called Independent Review is not independent at all and thus it falls at the first hurdle. Kym Anderson is a long term vocal advocate of genetically modified crops and has expressed such views regularly over the past two decades. The Independent Review was commissioned by the South Australian Minister for Primary Industries and Regional Development. There were 216 public submissions, of these, 78\% (n=168) were for retaining the existing Moratorium, 18\% (n=39) were for scrapping the Moratorium, and 4\% (n=8) were undecided. 100\% of the food available in Australian supermarkets is GM-free which mirrors the sentiments of Australian consumers, which are against GM-food; and Australian supermarkets are all aware of such sentiments. South Australia (SA) has a ?clean and green? image. This image serves SA well for food production, trade, tourism, education and migration. GMOs would damage SA?s clean and green and smart image and can thereby be economically detrimental to the state. The Independent Review proposes that GM canola is the sole candidate for uptake were the GM Moratorium to be scrapped. The GM canolas (Round-up ready, TT) proposed for SA are herbicide-dependent crops relying on regimes of multiple toxic herbicide applications. Glyphosate is a carcinogen and triazine is banned in Europe. These are chemicals that are dangerous to the health and wellbeing of animals, including humans, and the environment, and prescribing their use can be expected to increase SA?s health costs and future environmental clean-up costs. GM agriculture is an example of privatising the profits and socialising the costs. Australia is the world leader in organic agriculture and accounts for 51\% of the world?s certified organic hectares, and, of this, South Australia is the leading organics state in Australia accounting for 40\% of Australia?s certified organic hectares (and 20\% of the world?s certified organic hectares). Organic produce sells at a price premium - usually in the range of 10\% and 110\% (compared to non-organic). This contrasts with GM canola which sells at a price penalty of 7\%. These price premiums and price penalties reflect market sentiment - what the market wants and what the market does not want. The GM Moratorium has a social licence and is serving SA well and should be maintained on economic and social grounds. The Independent Review should be rejected.},

        abstract = {Organic agriculture in Australia is a success story. Certified organic agriculture in Australia accounts for 35.6 million hectares which is 8.8\% of Australia?s agricultural land. The rate of growth of organics in Australia has been16.5\% per annum for the past two decades. Based on certified hectares, Australia is now the world leader in organics, and now accounts for more than fifty percent of the world?s certified organic hectares.

The development of organic agriculture throughout Australia has been somewhat uneven. The map of organic agriculture in Australia, reveals that South Australia and Queensland are the standout leaders based on certified hectares. Western Australia is underperforming on this metric (as are also Victoria and Tasmania). The map of organic producers reveals good prospects for growth in organics hectares for Victoria and Tasmania (and the opportunity for growth in WA).

The prospects for organics are very favourable, with most adults agreeing with the proposition that it is unsafe to eat food grown with pesticides. Globally, substantial numbers of shoppers seek organic foods and avoid genetically modified (GM) foods.

Western Australia has 4.70 million hectares of certified organic land. This compares to 0.96 million hectares of GM crops (canola and cotton). There is a price premium for organic. In contrast, GM canola sells at a discount of about 10\% compared to non-GM canola.

Western Australia has a long history of engagement with organics dating from 1928 when members of the Genoni family, including those who farmed near Broomehill and Kojonup, took up Rudolf Steiner?s biodynamic farming ideas.

The state of Sikkim in India has recently achieved the distinction of becoming the world?s first state to be 100\% organic, with all farmers and all agricultural land now certified. Other states in India are following Sikkim?s lead. The Dominican Republic has taken an alternative path to growing organics, and it accounts for 55\% of the world?s organic bananas. 

The prospects for the growth of organics in WA are good. A new dedicated organics advocacy entity with a passion, a mission, a plan and a view to succession could well serve the cause of organics in WA, grow the sector, and enhance the perception of WA as a source of premium food and crops.},

        abstract = {This paper frames genetically modified organisms (GMOs) as invasive species. This offers a way of considering the reception, diffusion and management of GMOs in the foodscape. ?An invasive non-native species is any non-native animal or plant that has the ability to spread causing damage to the environment, the economy, our health and the way we live? (NNSS, 2017). Without any social licence, pesticide companies have thrust GMOs into the foodscape. The release of GMOs has generally been unwelcome, there has been no ?pull? factor from consumers and there has been vocal resistance from many. The apologists for GMOs have argued the self-contradictory conceit that GMOs are ?same but different?. Under this logically untenable stance, GMOs are to be excluded from specific regulation because they are the ?same? as existing organisms, while simultaneously they are ?different? and so open to patenting. GMOs are patented and this demonstrates that, prima facie, these are novel organisms which are non-native to the foodscape. GMO apologists have campaigned intensively, and successfully in USA, to ensure that consumers are kept in the dark and that GMOs remain unlabelled - as a consequence GMOs are ubiquitous in US consumer foods. In contrast, in Australia GMOs are required to be labelled if present in consumer products and, in consequence, Australian food manufacturers do not use them. The release of a GMO calls for biosecurity measures. After trial plots of Monsanto GM canola in Tasmania in the 1990s, the sites continue to be biosecurity monitored for GMO escape, and volunteer canola plants continue to appear two decades later. In Western Australia the escape of GMO canola into a neighbouring organic farm resulted in the loss of organic certification and the monetary loss of the organic premium for produce. GMO produce sells for a 10\% discount because of market forces and the consumer aversion to GMOs. Where non-GM product is accidentally contaminated with some GM grain, the whole batch is discounted and is sold as GMO. There is a lack of evidence that GMOs can be contained and many jurisdictions have banned the introduction of GMOs. GMOs have the potential and the propensity to contaminate non-GMO crops and thereby devalue them. The evidence is that GMOs are invasive species, they are unwelcome by consumers, peaceful coexistence with non-GM varieties is a fiction, and GMOs are appropriately managed as a biosecurity issue.}

Australia is a global pygmy in the world of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and a giant in the global world of organics. Western Australia (WA) has a GMO moratorium in place with certain exemptions. GM produce sells at a discount compared to non-GM produce and organic produce. GM crops put non-GM growers and organic growers at risk of contamination and this can lead to economic losses. Non-GM produce contaminated with GM is discounted in the market place as GM produce. Such contamination causes economic harm to non-GM farmers and particularly to organic farmers. In the case of Marsh v Baxter, a WA farmer harmed by GM contamination (to the extent of \$85,000) went through the courts (with combined legal costs of approximately \$2 million) and the law failed to provide any remedy to the harmed party (Marsh). The simplest fix is to revert to the WA GM moratorium without exemptions. In the absence of that, a compulsory third party (CTP) GMO incident insurance is proposed. CTP works successfully in other areas of potential harm (e.g. motor accidents). CTP is an insurance and hence it deals with risk. CTP decouples the premium-payer (the potential source of harm) of the CTP from the claimant (the potential victim of harm) with an independent arbiter. No fault CTP is recommended.}

Four further exclusions in organic production are: genetically modified organisms (GMOs), irradiation, prophylactic antibiotics, and engineered nanoparticles. These six exclusions differentiate organic agriculture from chemical agriculture. Agriculture and food harvesting and production date back millennia, and until about a century ago that history is de facto organic. The Industrial Revolution ushered in an era of novel production strategies. Agriculture was not immune to new views of industrialization and reductionism. Advances in chemistry enabled some implementation of such views. Early in the diffusion of chemical farming practices, the Austrian mystic Rudolf Steiner (1865?1924) called for a differentiated agriculture free of these new synthetic chemical inputs. The terminology, theory, and practices of biodynamic agriculture evolved (in the 1920s and 1930s) from Steiner?s Agriculture Course of 1924. It was a guided evolution, coordinated by Ehrenfried Pfeiffer (1899?1961) in Switzerland. The UK agriculturist, Lord Northbourne (1896?1982), invited Pfeiffer to lead a conference on biodynamics at his farm in Kent (in 1939). The following year Northbourne published his manifesto of organic farming, ?Look to the Land.? In that book, he coined the term ?organic farming? and wrote of a contest of ?organic versus chemical farming?.The ideas and ideals of organic farming quickly proliferated internationally off the back of Northbourne?s  1940 book. Organic farming is now practiced in at least 179 countries, accounts for 50.9 million agricultural hectares, and a market value of US\$ 81.6 billion (?75 billion).}

Globally there are 51 million hectares of certified organic agriculture land and a further 39 million hectares of wild culture land. For the past two decades organic agriculture has been growing at 11.9\% per annum, thereby doubling the size of the sector every six years. Nevertheless, despite ten decades of advocacy for organics, only 1.1\% of the world?s agricultural land is certified organic. From the outset, the strategy has been to advance the sector ?one farm at a time?. This strategy has left the organics sector well short of the vision of the pioneers of organics who saw organic farming as a universal solution and a practice suited for all farmers and all agriculture. Successful exemplars of marketing strategies of converting ?one consumer at a time? remain elusive. Recent years have seen the development of new strategies for growth of the organics sector. The strategy of ?one crop at a time? has proved successful for the Dominican Republic which now produces 55\% of the world?s certified organic bananas. The strategy of ?one state at a time? has seen the state of Sikkim (in India) declare itself as the first Indian organic state. Meanwhile, other Indian states are working towards all-organic status, including Mizoram, Goa, Rajasthan and Meghalaya. The strategy of ?one island at a time? has seen the Pacific islands of Cicia (in Fiji) and Abaiang (in Kiribati) commit to 100\% organic farming. The strategy of ?one country at a time? sees Bhutan with the stated goal of being the world?s first organic nation. These new strategies rely for success on the tripartite cooperation of government, community and commerce. In the meantime, as these new strategies play out, only 11 countries report that 10\% or more of their agriculture land is organic, while 111 countries report that less than 1\% of their land is certified organic, which reveals great potential for new growth strategies.},

        abstract = {On a hunch, I travelled from Oxford to the Swiss village of Dornach. Could it be that there were Australians who joined the world?s earliest organic agriculture research organisation back in the 1920s or 1930s? Then, I had never heard of Ileen Macpherson. I discovered in the archives of the Goetheanum that twelve Australians had joined Rudolf Steiner?s Experimental Circle. This is the story of one of those pioneers of organic farming, Ileen Macpherson (1898-1984). Ileen Macpherson was the daughter of a farming family. They farmed large pastoral properties in the south of New South Wales (NSW); Paika Station (250,000 acres) and later Goonambil Station, in the Murrumbidgee Valley. In 1934, Ileen, along with her partner Ernesto Genoni (1885-1974), founded ?Demeter Biological Farm? in Dandenong, Victoria, Australia.  The Invisible Farmer Project {\ensuremath{<}}www.invisible farmer.net.au{\ensuremath{>}} aims to make the invisible visible. Here we scratch off some of the invisibility that has settled on an Australian pioneer of organic agriculture. Beginning more than eight decades ago, Ileen Macpherson, with her Demeter Farm and her partner Ernesto Genoni, blazed a trail for the development of biodynamics and organics. Australia is now a world leader in organic farming. Australian organics has been growing at 16\% annually for the past two decades. And Australia now accounts for a massive 45\% of the world?s certified organic agriculture hectares. But, in the beginning were just a few pioneers - so nearly invisible now - who took the vision of an Austrian philosopher to heart and set out to make it real.},

This was a dispute between two farmer neighbours at Kojonup, Western Australia. When the GMO moratorium was lifted in WA, Baxter promptly planted Monsanto GM canola along his border with his organic neighbour. Marsh had previously warned Baxter that the organic certification of the Marsh farm was at risk if it was contaminated by an incursion of GM canola. The foreseen incursion eventuated and the certifier (NASAA) withdrew the organic certification. Marsh sued Baxter. The parties agreed that the Marsh loss was \$85,000. The case (for nuisance and negligence) was lost in the Supreme Court of Western Australia, the WA Court of Appeals, and eventually the High Court of Australia. The cumulative costs of this litigation will exceed \$2 million. Monsanto indemnified the GM farmer, whereas the costs put the livelihood of the organic farmer at risk. The case offers no evidence that organic/GM co-existence is viable, and no confidence that current law provides any protection for organic farming from GM contamination or predatory planting.},

        abstract = {Just four years elapsed between the coining of the term ?organic farming? and the founding of an association devoted to the advocacy of organic farming. The world?s first association devoted to the promotion and proliferation of organic agriculture, the Australian Organic Farming and Gardening Society (AOFGS), was founded in Sydney, Australia, in October 1944. It is a geographically surprising sequel to the coining of the term ?organic farming? by Lord Northbourne and its first appearance in war-time Britain. Northbourne?s manifesto of organic farming, Look to the Land, was published in London in May 1940. When the AOFGS published a periodical, the Organic Farming Digest, it was the first association to publish an organics advocacy journal. The present paper addresses the question of how the ?organic farming? meme arrived in Australia. Candidates for influencing the founders of the AOFGS were (a) Lord Northbourne?s 1940 book, and/or (b) perhaps the derivative periodical Organic Farming and Gardening published in the USA by Jerome Rodale with its first issue dated May 1942, and (c) perhaps also the earlier book, Biodynamic Farming and Gardening by Dr Ehrenfried Pfeiffer which was published in 1938 in multiple editions (in London, New York, Italy, Switzerland and the Netherlands) which set out to introduce biodynamic agriculture to a broad audience. The archives and records of the AOFGS have not been located, and, in their absence, newspapers of the period 1938 to October 1944 (and through the period of the AOFGS, i.e. October 1944 to January 1955) were searched for references to these hree potential sources of influence. Pfeiffer and/or his book received two mentions in the Australian press in the pre-AOFGS period (in 1939 and 1942). Rodale and/or his periodical were not reported in the Australian press in the pre-AOFGS period. Northbourne and/or his book were reported in the Australian press as early as July 1940, and up the founding of the AOFGS, there were 14 Northbourne mentions in the Australian press (all of them favourable or neutral) across four states: South Australia (SA) (n=6); New South Wales (NSW) (n=4); Western Australia (WA) (n=3); and Queensland (QLD) (n=1). The conclusion drawn is that in adopting the term ?organic farming?, the AOFGS was informed primarily, and perhaps exclusively, by Northbourne?s book Look to the Land. The successful advocacy of organics by the AOFGS is clearly evidenced by the 353 mentions of Organic Farming in the Australian press during the course of the life of the AOFGS (1944-1952) and is contrasted by the zero mentions of Organic Farming prior to the founding of the AOFGS },

In a public review, over 400 submissions were received by the government with over ninety percent arguing for retaining the ban on GM crops, while Monsanto, Dow Agrosciences and the Grain Research and Development Corporation argued for lifting the moratorium. Many submissions argued that segregation of GM and non-GM crops would fail and that the doctrine of ?mutual co-existence? was unsafe. In the first year of GM canola in WA, the certified organic mixed farm of Steve Marsh was contaminated with GM canola seed which was allegedly dispersed from a neighbouring farm which planted GM canola in 2010. Marsh lost his organic certification due to GM contamination. Marsh has sought redress by consensus and via the courts.},

        abstract = {A landmark case against the planting of GMO crops in Australia has delivered a big win for GMO farmers and produced no protection for organic farmers. The case pitted farmer against farmer. An organic farmer, Steve Walsh, initiated the legal action against his GMO growing neighbour, Michael Baxter in the Supreme Court of Western Australia.
The Marsh and Baxter farms (477 hectares and 900 ha. respectively) are adjacent to each other and located in Kojonup, 260 km south east of the capital city of Perth in the wheat belt of Western Australia (WA) - and coincidentally nearby Broomhill was one of the earliest sites in the development of the organic movement in Australia (from 1930). Just before Baxter's first crop of Monsanto?s genetically modified (GM) Roundup Ready (RR) canola (a variety of rape) was harvested, the standing crop was sprayed with herbicide (glyphosate), and rather than being direct harvested, the crop was swathed, i.e. the stalks were mown off at their base, dropped in situ and windrowed, and left in the field (exposed to the elements) for collection in two or three weeks. GMO swathes, seeds and plant material were subsequently found dispersed over much of Marsh's farm. As a consequence 70\% of Marsh's farm lost its organic certification (from 29 December 2010 until it was restored in October 2013).
Marsh sued Baxter for economic loss (agreed between the parties as \$85,000), on the basis of common law negligence or private nuisance, and sought a permanent injunction, initially to stop Baxter in future planting GM canola in paddocks adjacent to Marsh's organic fields and finally lessened to stopping Baxter harvesting GM canola by swathing in adjacent paddocks. The case ran over three weeks, and was then dismissed in its entirety; so no nuisance, no negligence, no injunction, and no damages.},

Over the past decade, Australia and China have converted more land to organic agriculture than any other of the 160 countries reporting organic agriculture statistics (for Australia, 4.3 m newly converted hectares, and for China, 1.8 m hectares). Australia accounts for about a third of the world?s certified organic agriculture hectares. China?s ?economic miracle? has been at the great cost of environmental degradation. There is a role for the development of organic agriculture in China to help achieve a clean green future. Added to this, consumers want safe food and they attribute a premium price to certified organic food. This paper presents a spectrum of indices of organics leadership and reveals great opportunities for growth in the organics sector. There are opportunities for the development of organic aquaculture, organic wildculture, organic forestry, for growing the domestic market and per capita organic consumption, and for publishing organics research. Organic accounts for 0.86\% of global agricultural land, Australia?s agricultural land is 2.93\% certified organic, and for China the figure is 0.36\% which offers plenty of room for improvement. China?s prevailing levels of pollution call for massive remediation action, and the uptake of organic agriculture can be one component of the solution to restoring China?s environment to a healthy state and to providing safe food for consumers.}

When we use chemicals they don't stay where we use them, they impact the water and plants. We say that we need to consider all the environment. Most of our farm practices are traditional farming, so we are largely organic anyway". The Bhutan Minister added that "we are Buddhists, too, and we believe in living in harmony with nature. Animals have the right to live, we like to to see plants happy and insects happy". Gyamtsho admitted that "Going organic will take time" adding that "We have set no deadline. We can not do it tomorrow. Instead we will achieve it region by region and crop by crop". As well as being a member of cabinet, Gyamtsho is a farmer in the Himalayan kingdom, and he has studied farming methods in New Zealand and Switzerland.

Also in conversion to organic is the community grower group, Sanma Community Coconuts, with its 216 growers and 408 hectares. According to BFA: ?In Vanuatu coconuts are generally already grown organically with no synthetic fertilisers because the soil is very fertile; however organic certification will require farmers to keep more records of farm practices?. Organic certification is aimed at achieving a 20\% increase in farmer incomes and products will include organic coconut oil and organic copra. The processor Vanuatu Virgin Coconut Oil is already certified organic and Coconut Oil Production Santo is underway with certification. Bernie Glaser, CEO of Coconut Oil Production Santo, says that ?Organic certification could have a positive impact on the 60 per cent of the rural population that produce coconuts?.

Biodynamic agriculture is based on Rudolf Steiner?s agricultural lectures which were delivered, in German, in the small village of Koberwitz (Kobierzyce, Poland) in 1924. Steiner indicated that this was an agriculture for all farmers. Demeter-International report the figures from all the biodynamic farms covered by their own certification. This underestimates the total world biodynamic activity since some countries, for example Australia, are not covered by Demeter-International certification, and some biodynamic farmers are certified ?organic? (rather than ?biodynamic?) while some others are not certified at all.}

The museum caters for a variety of ages, from youngsters to oldsters, and for a variety of interests, from casual, to practical, to scholarly. Screen-based techno-interactive exhibits are an obvious hit with children. The Namyangju Organic Museum was launched to coincide with the 17th IFOAM Organic World Congress  (September - October 2011), the first such event to be held in Asia.This museum can serve as a focus for the continuing uptake and proliferation of organic food and agriculture in Korea and beyond. },

        abstract = {It has been claimed that organic agriculture is the fastest growing agriculture based industry in the world. The land devoted to organic agriculture worldwide has increased over the past decade from 15.8 million hectares to 37.2 million hectares exhibiting a compounding rate of growth of 8.9\% per annum. This paper disaggregates the global growth in organic agriculture land over the past decade using country as the unit of analysis. For each country, two indices of organics sector growth are derived, firstly, the actual hectares increase, and secondly, the hectares-multiplier, that is the factor by which the organic hectares have changed over the decade. Growth over the past decade is presented for 71 countries which taken together account for 35.3 million organic agricultural hectares, that is 94.8\% of the total global organic agriculture area and 58.2\% of the total global agriculture area. The analysis reveals that, underlying what appears at the global level to be steady incremental growth over the decade, the growth appears very uneven when disaggregated by country. The decadal increase in organic hectares ranges from Australia?s gain of 4.3 million organic hectares and China?s gain of 1.9 million organic hectares through to Costa Rica?s decrease of 1549 organic hectares. Globally, the organic hectares total has multiplied by 2.3 in the decade from 2001 to 2011, but this has varied greatly by country. Uruguay increased its organic hectares dramatically with a hectares-multiplier of 716.1, and India with a multiplier of 689.7. In contrast, Denmark has barely increased with a hectares-multiplier of 1.07, while Suriname exhibited the greatest shrinkage with a multiplier of 0.03. China and India are the only countries that rank in the top ten countries for both of the indices of organics growth, namely, the decadal organic hectares increase and the decadal organic hectares-multiplier.},

King?s book Farmers of Forty Centuries or Permanent Agriculture in China, Korea and Japan was privately published in Wisconsin, USA, in 1911. The book had an in-auspicious start, and the longevity and acclaim that this book has since achieved must have been, then, barely conceivable. The author was dead, the book was incomplete, and there was no commercial publisher. Yet through a combination of perhaps luck and circumstance the book was ?resurrected? in 1927 by a London publisher, Jonathan Cape, who then kept it in print for more than two decades. The London issue of King?s book was favorably cited in the 1930s and 1940s by leading agriculture and organic agriculture writers including: Lord Northbourne, Eve Balfour, Viscount Lymington, Albert and Louise Howard in Britain; Ehrenfried Pfeiffer in Switzerland; Jerome Rodale in the USA; and Stanton Hicks in Australia. These endorsements served to entrench King?s book as a ?classic?. Jerome Rodale reintroduced the book to a US audience with an edition published by his Organic Gardening Press, c.1949. King?s book arose out of his discontent with the views promulgated by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), he differentiated the Asian agriculture he encountered as ?permanent agricul-ture?, he provided a detailed account of the ancien r{\'e}gime organic agriculture of China, Korea and Japan, he called for a ?world movement? for agricultural reform, and his book was been taken as a validation of the principles of organic agriculture. At least twenty six impressions of Farmers of Forty Centuries have been published in the past century; ten of these appeared dur-ing the first nine decades, while 16 have appeared in the past decade.}

        abstract = {Biodynamic agriculture and organic farming have been regarded as having different provenances and having arisen independently. The present account introduces the ?missing link? between the two. In 1938 Ehrenfried Pfeiffer published the milestone book on biodynamics: Bio-Dynamic Farming and Gardening. In 1940 Lord Northbourne published Look to the Land, the work that introduced the term ?organic farming?. In the summer of the intervening year, Pfeiffer travelled from Switzerland to Northbourne?s estate in Kent, UK, and presented for British farmers a nine day course on biodynamics, the Betteshanger Summer School and Conference on Bio-Dynamic Farming, 1-9 July 1939. Pfeiffer was supported by the pre-eminent biodynamic scholar-practitioners, Otto Eckstein and Hans Heinze. Dr Scott Williamson of the Peckham Experiment was the sole British lecturer at the Betteshanger Summer School. For the UK Bio-Dynamic Association, the Betteshanger Summer School was the highlight of the year. Northbourne and Pfeiffer had collaborated on the Farleigh Experiment in 1938, and Northbourne had travelled to Switzerland in January 1939 to arrange Pfeiffer?s visit. War broke out less than eight weeks after the Betteshanger Summer School. Northbourne?s manifesto on organic agriculture, Look to the Land, was published in May of the following year. The book took the Steinerian and biodynamic view of ?the farm as an organism? as its central tenet and adopted it as the nominative motif for ?organic? farming. The book offered to the Anglophone world an account that was secular and distanced from any Anthroposophic or Germanic roots. Subsequently, Northbourne sought to bring Pfeiffer to the UK but Pfeiffer?s next and final visit was in 1950. The Betteshanger Summer School and Conference on biodynamics has been otherwise unreported. As this account demonstrates, Betteshanger was a stepping stone from biodynamics to organics. Northbourne sponsored Pfeiffer?s visit and the Betteshanger biodynamics conference in 1939, and the following year he introduced his term ?organic farming? and its philosophy in his book Look to the Land.},

Biodynamic farming is the progenitor of organic agriculture. Ground-zero for biodynamics and organics is the Agriculture Course presented in the summer of 1924 by Dr Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) to a group of 111 farmers and others at Koberwitz, Germany (now Kobierzyce, Poland). Rudolf Steiner called for a natural agriculture rejecting the prevailing thrust for the chemicalization of agriculture, evidenced, at the time, particularly by the uptake of synthetic fertilisers. Steiner?s ?hints? have evolved into a suite of farming practices now called ?biodynamic? (BD) agriculture. One BD practitioner, Lord Northbourne, coined the term ?organic farming? (in 1940) and presented his manifesto of organic agriculture, Look to the Land, which has spawned the international alternative agriculture movement of organic farming. Germany leads the world with 84,426 BD hectares, followed by Australia with 49,797 BD ha, and France with 14,629 BD ha. Steiner?s particularised form of organic agriculture, viz. biodynamic farming, is a subset (of 30.0\% and 0.35\% respectively) of the 186 countries which account for a global total of 71,514,583 certified organic hectares. A table of countries and associated BD hectares is included. All hectare data reported in the present paper are for certified operations. The map presented is an area cartogram. The size and scope of the uncertified biodynamics and organics sectors remain undetermined.},

States and territories are resized according to their measure for each attribute. The base-map for Australia, with states and territories coloured according to their state colours (or a variation thereof), is the standard cartographic representation of the country. The three organics maps are density-equalising cartograms (area cartograms) where equal areas on the map represent equal measures (densities) of the parameter under consideration. This mapping protocol creates distorted yet recognisable new maps that reveal where there is a high presence of the parameter under consideration (and the state or territory is ?fat?), or a low presence (and the state or territory is ?skinny?). These three maps visually reveal the uneven distribution of the metrics of organics across Australia, and, on a state by state basis, they suggest unrealised opportunities and potentials.}

Crantz (camelina or false flax) and its mixtures with Brassica napus (rape) SVO as fuel in adapted diesel engines are described with chemical parameters, measurements in a test engine and a field test in a tractor. Camelina as a crop is attracting attention in organic farming and is often used in mixed cropping systems with low competition to food production area. Camelina SVO has low oxidation stability. Its polymerization affinity limits the storage time and increase the risk of coking at hot motor components and of thickening processes in the lubricant oil of the engine. In mixtures with rape and camelina SVO, threshold limits for Conradson Carbon Residues and for oxidation resistance were exceeded. The oxidation resistance could be prolonged by the addition of commercial antioxidants. Camelina and rape SVO showed very similar burning characteristics at full-to-medium partial engine loads. Under low partial loads and idle load, the burning function of the various fuels was increasingly delayed, beginning with diesel fuel over pure rape SVO, then a mixture containing 700 dm3 m!3 rape SVO, and 300 dm3 m!3 camelina SVO, through to pure camelina SVO. The exhaust emissions of NOx-, CO-, particles and HC of rape SVO, camelina SVO and their described mixture were not significantly different. The typically higher NOx- and lower HC-emissions of SVO compared to diesel fuel were apparent. The results principally reveal the usability of a cold pressed, non-refined camelina-rape SVO mixture in adapted diesel engines.},

We reviewed the evidence for a large range of agroecological practices and made a close comparison between conventional agricultural systems and integrated agriculture, organic farming and agroforestry, comparing on a range of factors.
Overall, the study found that agroecological approaches can and should make a substantial contribution to sustainable intensification. However, there is a need for better information and knowledge exchange systems on agroecological approaches.}

        abstract = {Long-term effects of organic and conventional farming systems in parallel on the microbiota of boreal arable soil from forage and cereal crop fields were investigated. Microbial activity was measured as basal respiration and microbial biomass C and N were determined by fumigation extraction. Microbial abundance was determined by gene copy numbers from bacterial and archaeal specific 16S rRNA genes and the fungal ITS2 region with quantitative PCR. Microbial community composition for soil bacteria and fungi, including arbuscular mycorrhiza, were conducted by amplicon sequencing with richness assessed from OTU reads. We detected changes in both bacterial and fungal community composition between the farming systems. Microbial activity and biomass C and N were higher in the organic system for cereal crop rotation compared to the respective conventional system. In the autumn, organic systems had higher microbial richness. As fungi were more abundant in the autumn, they may be responsible for both higher microbial activity and C sequestration in their biomass after harvesting, especially in the organic system for cereal crop rotation. Also, crop type and cow manure explained changes in fungal community composition. The typical bacterial community of the organic system for cereal crop rotation included many soil and plant health promoting bacterial groups. Fungi benefiting from organic farming practices, other than manure, may include endophytic taxa with a variety of functions as well as pathogenic and mycotoxin producing species. Overall, the results suggest that farming practices typical of organic farming, such as use of green manure and continuous plant cover have induced changes in the soil microbiome.},

In Experiment (Exp.) 1, stabled calves were fed chicory silage (CHI1; n = 9) or ryegrass/clover hay (CTL1; n = 6) with balanced protein/energy intakes between groups. After 16 days, all calves received 10 000 Ostertagia ostertagi and 66 000 Cooperia oncophora third-stage larvae (L3) [day (D) 0 post-infection (p.i.)]. In Exp. 2, calves were assigned to pure chicory (CHI2; n=10) or ryegrass/clover (CTL2; n = 10) pastures. After 7 days, animals received 20 000 O. ostertagi L3/calf (D0 p.i.) and were moved regularly preventing pasture-borne infections. Due to poor regrowth of the chicory pasture, CHI2 was supplemented with chicory silage. At D40 p.i. (Exp. 1) and D35 p.i. (Exp. 2) calves were slaughtered for worm recovery. In Exp.1, fecal egg counts (FEC) were similar between groups. However, O. ostertagi counts were significantly reduced in CHI1 by 60\% (geometric mean; P {\ensuremath{<}} 0?01), whereas C. oncophora burdens were unaffected (P = 0?12). In Exp. 2, FEC were markedly lowered in CHI2 from D22 p.i onwards (P {\ensuremath{<}} 0?01). Ostertagia ostertagi adult burdens were significantly reduced in CHI2 by 66\% (P {\ensuremath{<}} 0?001). Sesquiterpene lactones were identified only in chicory (fresh/silage). Chicory shows promise as an anti-Ostertagia feed for cattle and further studies should investigate its on-farm use.},

Moreover, private marketers could refuse, in the future, products (e.g. milk) from organic farms using conventional straw. In this context, a crucial question is ?What alternative to the use of conventional straw in organic farming system?? This question, assessed by a farmer association (Agrobio35), was studied by a group of students. A bibliographic review was done of i) the existing alternatives of conventional straw in organic farming, ii) the feasibility (technic, economic, implementation) of theses alternative by the farmers. This review was completed by a survey of height farmers to collect their feedbacks about the relevance of the alternatives tools they apply (wooden chips, sand, wheat flour). The survey results were used to build a leaflet dedicated for advisors and farmers looking for alternatives.},

the aim was to consider, if increasing duration of the organic farming period also increases diversity.
Finally, ecological interpretations of the data were given by comparing different agricultural practises
in terms of general vegetation community patterns.
The results documented that diversity of plant species was significantly higher within the organic field
boundaries. Furthermore, there was a tendency towards higher diversity of plant species in the field
boundaries that had been managed organically longest. Finally, analysis of community patterns
revealed that Ruderal plant species are indicators of intensive or conventional farming. Altogether this
study supports previous conclusions on low-intensive or organic farming as a method of enhancing the

Thirdly, ecological interpretations of the data were given by comparing organic and conventional field boundaries in terms of general vegetation community patterns. 

The results documented that diversity of plant species was significantly higher within the organic field boundaries. Analysis of community patterns revealed that Ruderal species and species with affinity to nutrient rich conditions were most common in conventional field borders, whereas Stress-tolerators were indicators of organic farming. These differences occurred only 3 ? 4 years after conversion to organic farming indicating that herbicide cessation is a major explanatory variable. Furthermore, there was a tendency towards higher diversity of plant species in the field boundaries that had been managed organically longest.

Altogether this study supports previous conclusions on extensive, organic farming as a method of enhancing the integrity of nature within the agricultural landscape.},

        abstract = {Within organic farming there is a continued effort to close nutrient cycles in order to improve nutrient use efficiency for crop production while also minimizing environmental impacts. In Denmark a long-term crop rotation experiment on three soil types, i.e., Jyndevad (4.5\% clay, 2.0\% C), Foulum (8.8\% clay, 3.8\% C) and Flakkebjerg (15.5\% clay, 1.7\% C), provides a platform for studies of agronomic and environmental aspects of organic farming. Selected results from investigations at these sites are presented.
   In 2007 and 2008 one study determined soil microbial biomass N and mineralizable N on all three locations during the growing season in four selected rotations, three organic and one conventional; the objective was to evaluate the role of soil organic N dynamics for crop N supply. Consistent effects of crop rotation were observed across the three sites, but there were dramatic differences between soils in the ability to store N in labile organic pools. 
   The greenhouse gas balance of organic farming systems has become an important indicator of sustainability, and strategies to mitigate emissions are investigated. Nitrous oxide emissions were monitored in the field between October 2007 and September 2008 at Foulum and Flakkebjerg in the winter wheat crop included in all four rotations, which differed in manure strategy (livestock slurry, grass-clover  green manure, or mineral N) and use of catch crops. At both sites fluxes were measured concurrently at least twice per month. Also, a second monitoring program of N2O emissions was conducted between March 2008 and May 2009 to investigate grass-clover co-digestion as a strategy to improve N use efficiency and reduce N2O emissions per unit product. Here, all crops in the rotation were represented in the monitoring program. Both studies indicate that N input rather than cropping system or soil management control the extent of N2O emissions. 
   Our limited ability to control N2O emissions may be due to the fact that N2O production is caused by complex interactions between C/N transformations and soil properties, including moisture. This has been investigated using intact and repacked soil from Foulum and Flakkebjerg sites. Adjusting the soil to well-defined soil water potentials with or without amendments serve to illustrate these interactions and the microbial response to nutrient supply and soil aeration.
   Ammonia volatilization after livestock slurry application should be avoided as NH3 is an indirect source of N2O, and NH3 losses will reduce crop yields in N limited cropping systems. Livestock slurry treatment (anaerobic digestion, separation) and application methods (trailhose, direct injection) can influence the potential for NH3 volatilization by reducing the slurry-air contact, but with a possible trade-off with direct N2O emissions. Some results from a two-year field study, and their implications for manure management, are discussed.

Their composition with regard to cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, extractives and ash was evaluated, as well as their potential as raw materials for ethanol and biogas production. The materials were pretreated by wet oxidation using parameters previously found to be optimal for pretreatment of corn stover (195 1C, 15 min, 2 g l\_1 Na2CO3 and 12 bar oxygen). It was shown that pretreatment was necessary for ethanol production from all raw materials and gave increased biogas yield from winter rye straw. Neither biogas productivity nor yield from oilseed rape straw or faba bean straw was significantly affected by pretreatment. Ethanol was produced by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae during simultaneous enzymatic hydrolysis of the solid material after wet oxidation with yields of 66\%, 70\% and 52\% of theoretical for winter rye, oilseed rape and faba bean straw, respectively. Methane was produced with yields of 0.36, 0.42 and 0.44 l g\_1 volatile solids for winter rye, oilseed rape and faba bean straw, respectively, without pretreatment of the materials. However, biogas productivity was low and it took over 50 days to reach the final yield. It could be concluded that all three materials are possible raw materials for either biogas or ethanol production; however, improvement of biogas productivity or ethanol yield is necessary before an economical process can be achieved. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This is simultaneously a big opportunity in terms of poverty reduction and a significant threat to the environment. The objective of this paper is to present an approach to co-create a set of viable and acceptable development pathways for the livestock sector that maximizes benefits from increased production, exploits the synergies between livestock and the environment, while minimizing the negative effects. It engages local stakeholders and actors into a computer-assisted participatory process, through which local trade-offs and synergies between livestock production, livelihood benefits and environmental impacts can be explored. Scenarios reached by consensus among local stakeholders challenge the dominant discourse of livestock intensification. They suggest that combining extensive and intensive modes enables increased production of animal sourced food with lower additional pressure on the environment than current production modes. The right combination of extensive and intensive production allows for an efficient use of the local biomass and feed resources, and offers opportunities to improve livelihoods for all stakeholders despite their differing economic circumstances, values and traditions.},

Because conventional production of chickens has gone further than any other animal production system towards complete control of the animal?s brief lives, development of effective silvo-poultry systems seems particularly necessary for these essentially woodland birds. The objective is to develop a production system that closely matches the physiological and behavioural needs of the animals being reared. For the example of chickens, this means trying to mimic a woodland/forest-clearing environment. By providing a wide range of trees, shrubs and herbs, it should be possible to provide shelter, nutrition and medicinal benefits for the birds. At the same time, the system needs to fulfil other functions in terms of biodiversity and community assets for the farm, together with profitable organic chicken production.},

Three experiments compared the late blight severity and progress in mixtures with that in pure stands. Disease on susceptible or moderately resistant varieties typical of those in commercial use was similar in mixtures and pure stands. In 2 of 3 years, there were slight reductions on cv. Sante, which is moderately susceptible, in mixture with cv. Cara, which is moderately resistant. Cara was unaffected by this mixture. Mixtures of an immune or near-immune partner with Cara or Sante substantially reduced disease on the latter.
The effect of the size of plots of individual varieties or mixtures on blight severity was compared in two experiments. Larger plots had a greater area under the disease progress curve, but the average rate of disease progress was greater in smaller plots;
this may be because most disease progress took place later, under more favourable conditions, in the smaller plots. In one experiment, two planting densities were used.
Density had no effect on disease and did not interact with mixture effects. The overall conclusion is that, while mixtures of potato varieties may be desirable for other reasons, they do not offer any improvement on the average of the disease resistance
of the components.}

        abstract = {Agroecology uses natural processes and local resources rather than chemical inputs to ensure production while limiting the environmental footprint of livestock and crop production systems. Selecting to achieve a maximization of target production criteria has long proved detrimental to fitness traits. However, since the 1990s, developments in animal breeding have also focussed on animal robustness by balancing production and functional traits within overall breeding goals. We discuss here how an agroecological perspective should further shift breeding goals towards functional traits rather than production traits. Breeding for robustness aims to promote individual adaptive capacities by considering diverse selection criteria which include reproduction, animal health and welfare, and adaptation to rough feed resources, a warm climate or fluctuating environmental conditions. It requires the consideration of genotype{$\times$}environment interactions in the prediction of breeding values. Animal performance must be evaluated in low-input systems in order to select those animals that are adapted to limiting conditions, including feed and water availability, climate variations and diseases. Finally, we argue that there is no single agroecological animal type, but animals with a variety of profiles that can meet the expectations of agroecology. The standardization of both animals and breeding conditions indeed appears contradictory to the agroecological paradigm that calls for an adaptation of animals to local opportunities and constraints in weakly artificialized systems tied to their physical environment.}

        abstract = {Agroecology uses ecological processes and local resources rather than chemical inputs to develop productive and resilient livestock and crop production systems. In this context, breeding innovations are necessary to obtain animals that are both productive and adapted to a broad range of local contexts and diversity of systems. Breeding strategies to promote agroecological systems are similar for different animal species. However, current practices differ regarding the breeding of ruminants, pigs and poultry. Ruminant breeding is still an open system where farmers continue to choose their own breeds and strategies. Conversely, pig and poultry breeding is more or less the exclusive domain of international breeding companies which supply farmers with hybrid animals. Innovations in breeding strategies must therefore be adapted to the different species. In developed countries, reorienting current breeding programmes seems to be more effective than developing programmes dedicated to agroecological systems that will struggle to be really effective because of the small size of the populations currently concerned by such systems. Particular attention needs to be paid to determining the respective usefulness of cross-breeding v. straight breeding strategies of well-adapted local breeds. While cross-breeding may offer some immediate benefits in terms of improving certain traits that enable the animals to adapt well to local environmental conditions, it may be difficult to sustain these benefits in the longer term and could also induce an important loss of genetic diversity if the initial pure-bred populations are no longer produced. As well as supporting the value of within-breed diversity, we must preserve between-breed diversity in order to maintain numerous options for adaptation to a variety of production environments and contexts. This may involve specific public policies to maintain and characterize local breeds (in terms of both phenotypes and genotypes), which could be used more effectively if they benefited from the scientific and technical resources currently available for more common breeds. Last but not least, public policies need to enable improved information concerning the genetic resources and breeding tools available for the agroecological management of livestock production systems, and facilitate its assimilation by farmers and farm technicians.},

Five samples from soil were evaluated at 8 days before the beginning of the experiment, 0; 6; 60 and 114 days after manuring (dam). LCF was the attribute that presented the most consistent correlation with TOC that is usually utilized to detect changes in soil organic matter. Increasing dosages of organic compost caused the increase of MBC, LCF, LCNF, LCA and TOC. From 60 days after planting and forward, MBC and LCF presented decrease of their levels according to the quality of organic compost. Pasture and forest soils behave as contrasts, holding lower and higher content of carbon of soil, respectively.},

Foi utilizado o delineamento experimental inteiramente casualizado, com cinco repeticoes, sendo os tratamentos dispostos em esquema fatorial 2 x 2 , correspondentes a 2 epocas de colheita (30 e 45 dias apos o aparecimento dos primeiros frutos maduros) em 2 sistemas de cultivo (organico e convencional). As amostras do milho verde foram obtidas junto a EMBRAPA Milho e Sorgo, em Sete Lagoas/MG, na safra 2007/2008, tendo sido adotado o delineamento inteiramente casualizado com tres repeticoes, sendo os tratamentos dispostos em esquema fatorial 4 x 2 , correspondentes a 4 cultivares (AG 1051, BR 106, SWB 551 e VIVI) em 2 sistemas de cultivo (organico e convencional). Foram determinadas as caracteristicas agronomicas do milho verde As amostras do tomate cereja, juntamente com o milho verde, foram avaliadas quanto as caracteristicas fisico-quimicas, a composi{\c c}{\~a}o centesimal, ao teor de carotenoides e de aminas biogenicas. Foram submetidas, ainda, as analises microbiologicas e parasitologicas. Na analise das caracteristicas agronomicas, os cultivares apresentaram, demodo geral, boa producao de milho verde no sistema organico. Os tomates colhidos aos 30 dias apresentaram valores inferiores de solidos soluveis totais e carotenoides totais quando comparados aqueles colhidos aos 45 dias. Os frutos resultantes da producao organica possuem maior teor de carotenoides. Os valores medios do indice L* foram superiores no tomate produzido no cultivo convencional Nas amostras de milho verde os valores medios de pH, de acidez total titulavel, de a*, de carboidratos, de valor energetico total e p* caroteno foram superiores nos graos oriundos de cultivo organico. Graos de milho verde dos cultivares AG 1051, BR 106 e SWB 551 tambem apresentaram maior teor de extrato etereo, quando produzidos no sistema organico.

Although knowledge about mastitis and its optimal technical management and treatment is now available, some dairy farmers still use antibiotics in inappropriate ways. Antibiotic use by farmers can be influenced by personal restraints and motivations, but it can be assumed that external drivers are also influential. The main purpose of this article is thus to analyse the choices of antibiotic and alternative medicine use for mastitis treatment and investigate the possible influence of two unexplored external drivers in dairy farms: (i) the health advice offered to farmers by farm advisors and veterinarians, (ii) the dairy farming system, as defined by combining the market valuation chosen for the milk, the level of intensification, and the perceived pressure related to investments. Research was based on 51 individual semi-structured interviews with farmers and their corresponding veterinarians and farm advisors. Based on verbatim, the use of antibiotics and alternative medicine by farmers for mastitis treatment, the vet-farmers interactions, and the dairy farming systems are described. The advisory relationships between farmers and farm advisors and between farmers and veterinarians influenced the implementation of selective dry cow therapy, but had very little effect on the use of alternative medicines by farmers, who were more willing to experiment alternative medicines than their advisors. The dairy farming system had very little influence on antibiotic use: some misuse of antibiotics was found whatever the farming system. Systematic dry cow therapy was also a widespread habit in all dairy farming systems except organic. The use of alternative medicine was common in all farming systems.}

Three main types of systems were identified: farms close to conventional farms as regard to the housing premises, farms mainly under the French ?Label Rouge Fermier? and with part of their pigs raised outdoors and farms mainly organic, characterized by runners allowing outdoor access (sows, gilts, fattening pigs) and litter bedding for indoor compartments (farrowing sows and weaners) and by more frequent reproduction disorders in sows and a lack of sanitary lock.

Here, we assessed the performance of different soil health tests on the top soil (0-10 cm) of different agricultural ?habitats?, from an organically managed grassland to a conventional potato production in Norway. In each production system, grassland and potato, we selected different areas where variations on soil health were expected. In the grassland, a gradient from cultivated to permanent pasture was selected. In the conventional potato field, plots that received different organic materials (biochar, digestate, farmyard manure) two years prior to the soil assessment, were selected. The tests were performed in early summer 2021 (June) for the grassland, and in summer 2021 (July) after the harvest of early potatoes in the potato field. The tests comprised different aspects of soil health: soil organic matter content (ignition loss), labile soil carbon fractions (Active C), soil biology (microbiology and mesofauna) and soil biological activity (soil respiration and feeding activity) and soil aggregate stability. Test results were used to compare the systems and the areas within the systems. Overall, the tests significantly differentiate between organically managed pasture and conventional potato field, with the first showing better values for soil health. However, the tests did not significantly differentiate between areas/treatments within the production systems. Yet, in the organically managed grassland, permanent pasture showed a trend of better soil health than cultivated areas. In the conventional potato field, selected soil health tests were not sensitive to capture the residual effects of the organic amendments, and untreated and treated soil showed very similar values. To be able to visualize the results together, we normalized the data by diving single values by the maximum value observed for each soil indicator within each system. By doing so, we obtained an overall soil health diagram that can be easily interpreted by farmers and advisors. The use of several simple tests together showed to be valuable also to inform about soil health within the to two production systems. Yet, a visual evaluation of the topsoil and chemical nutrient analysis is recommended to complement these tests. Furthermore, we need more field data to obtain ?reference levels? for these tests, that would help with the interpretation of their results in the future.},

        abstract = {The density and diversity of springtails (Collembola) in the upper soil layer (0?3.8 cm) were studied in a perennial grass-clover ley in NW Norway during April?June 2012. The study was part of a field experiment comparing yields and soil characteristics after application of non-digested slurry (NS) versus anaerobically digested slurry (DS) from dairy cows. In total for three sampling dates, 39 species of springtails were identified. In the Control plots receiving no manure, the density level was around 30 000 individuals (ind.) m2 throughout the whole season. Three days after slurry application (40 t ha -1), the density of springtails had dropped significantly; from 55 214 to 7410 ind. m2 in the NS treatment and from 41 914 to 10 260 ind. m2 in the DS treatment. After 7 weeks the densities had increased again to 54\% and 38\% of the initial levels in NS and DS treatments, respectively. The springtails were divided into two ecological groups based on morphology and colour. The epigeic group comprised surface-dwelling species with eye organs and pigmentation. The endogeic group comprised soil-dwelling species lacking eye organs and pigmentation, and generally with shorter extremities than those found in the epigeic group. The negative effect of manure application on density was more severe and long-lasting in the epigeic than in the endogeic group. This effect was similar for both manure types. One species (Parisotoma notabilis) comprised 50\% of the epigeic population, while three Mesaphorura spp. and Stanaphorura lubbocki comprised half the endogeic population. In general, the community structure, described by the relative abundance of each species, was more affected by manure application in the epigeic than in the endogeic group.
Hence, slurry application seemed to affect surface-dwelling species more negatively than soil dwelling species, even within the small sampling depth used here. The density of endogeic species seemed to recover faster than the density of the epigeic species. A simplified classification of epigeic and endogeic springtails, based on the presence or absence of pigmentation and eyes, may be useful in studies of soil springtails where identification of the actual species is not the primary purpose.},

        abstract = {Numerous advantages of combining cattle and sheep have been demonstrated at the grazing-season level, but the effects of this practice on system self-sufficiency require system-level and longer-term studies. We established three grassland-based organic systems as separate farmlets: one mixed system combining beef cattle and sheep (MIX) and two specialised systems, beef cattle (CAT) and sheep (SH),
to serve as reference points. These farmlets were managed for 4 years, to assess the benefits of combining beef cattle and sheep in promoting the production of grass-fed meat and strengthening system selfsufficiency. The ratio of cattle to sheep livestock units in MIX was 60:40. The surface area and stocking rate were similar across all systems. Calving and lambing were adjusted to grass growth to optimise grazing. Calves were pasture-fed from 3 months old on average until weaning in October, fattened indoors with haylage and slaughtered at 12?15 months. Lambs were pasture-fed from 1 month old on average until slaughter; if lambs were not ready for slaughter when the ewes mated, they were stall-finished with concentrates. The decision to supplement adult females with concentrate was based on the achievement
of a target body condition score (BCS) at key periods. The decision to treat animals with anthelmintics was based on mean faecal egg excretion remaining below a certain threshold. A higher proportion of lambs were pasture-finished in MIX vs SH (P {\ensuremath{<}} 0.001) due to a higher growth rate (P {\ensuremath{<}} 0.001) which led to a lower age at slaughter (166 vs 188 days, P {\ensuremath{<}} 0.001). Ewe prolificacy and productivity were higher in MIX vs SH (P {\ensuremath{<}} 0.02 and P {\ensuremath{<}} 0.065, respectively). The levels of concentrate consumption and number of anthelmintic treatments in sheep were lower in MIX vs SH (P {\ensuremath{<}} 0.01 and P {\ensuremath{<}} 0.08). Cow productivity, calf
performance, carcass characteristics and the level of external inputs used did not differ between systems.
However, cow BW gain during the grazing season was higher in MIX vs CAT (P {\ensuremath{<}} 0.05). These outcomes validated our hypothesis that the association of beef cattle and sheep promoted the self-sufficient production of grass-fed meat in the sheep enterprise. It also promoted better ewe and cow BCS and BW at key stages of the reproduction cycle and better development of the females used for replacement, which may enhance animal and system resilience.},

        abstract = {This review aimed to systematically map and summarize the status of animal health and welfare in organic production. The prevalence of diseases and behavioural effects in organic dairy cow, beef cattle, sheep, pig, laying hen and broiler chicken were discussed in the context of the organic values and current knowledge on animal health and welfare. In total 166 peer-reviewed scientific publications between 2008 and 2020 were included. No strong evidence for neither inferior nor distinctly higher animal welfare in organic compared with conventional production could be supported. The welfare status of organic livestock is in general good in relation to the OIE definition of animal health and welfare. However, organic systems are still facing several challenges related to animal health and the arising of goal conflicts due to management and practical implications. Greater possibilities to perform species-specific behaviours in organic production systems, however, indicate that the organic standards offer a good framework for high animal welfare management. For organic dairy farmers, the main health problems are similar to those of non-organic farms; especially mastitis and lameness need improvement. Parasites, together with mastitis and lamb mortality, are important welfare issues in organic sheep production. Piglet mortality, leg problems, parasite load and increasing respiratory problems are of major relevance in organic pig production. For organic laying hens, major health challenges relate to feather pecking and cannibalism, parasites and possibilities to express species-specific behaviours. For organic broilers, dermatitis of footpads, hocks and breast are reported as main health issues.},

        abstract = {The yields of crops in organic farming are typically lower than in conventional farming, although this depend greatly on local climatic conditions and on crop and soil management. A long-term study over three consecutive 4-year cropping cycles at three locations in Denmark compared organic arable cropping systems varying in fertilization management (green manure crops, cover crops, livestock manure) to study the long-term effects of soil fertility management on crop yields. The analysis of the results showed that the nitrogen (N) derived from cover crops has a legacy effect on the dry matter and N grain yield of spring barley being traceable 5-8 years back in time. The net N input of crop residues and manure for the crop cycles 1-4 and 5-8 years prior to the winter wheat had a significant effect on both the dry matter and N grain yield of wheat.

The management of organic cropping systems should focus on reducing the weed pressure, promoting soil fertility and increasing the soil N supply to optimize crop yields. For both winter wheat and spring barley, the weed pressure reduced both crop dry matter and the N grain yield. A cover crop as pre-crop had a significant positive effect on both dry matter and N yield of spring barley, while a cover crop in the rotation did not significantly affect grain yield of winter wheat. For both winter wheat and spring barley, manure application was most effective in increasing crop yields. However, N in applied crop residues also had considerable yield-enhancing effects. For winter wheat, the N inputs from crop residues from previous crop rotation cycles (1-4 and 5-8 years) significantly increased yields, while for spring barley, N input in crop residues from incorporated cover crop and the long-term crop rotation cycle (5-8 years) significantly enhanced both dry matter and N grain yield. These legacy effects of soil fertility management through enhancing and retaining organic N inputs of organic arable cropping suggest that a holistic approach to soil and crop management is necessary, and this needs to focus on increasing weed suppression, soil fertility and targeting manure inputs for enhanced N uptake.},

A pesquisa se desenvolveu em tr{\^e}s comunidades, Arroio Grande, Marmeleiro e Rio Vinagre. Foram avaliados os custos e as mudancas sociais ocorridas na vida dos agricultores que optaram pelo sistema de producao agroecologico, de miiho e feijao, comparativamente a producao no sistema convencional (conforme recomendacao do orgao de extensao rural). Foi avaliada tambem a eficiencia energetica, por meio da analise ecoenergetica, dos sistemas de producao, em duas das tr{\^e}s comunidades estudadas. A analise de custo foi baseada em dados coletados em experimento de campo, onde se implantou em cada comunidade dois tratamentos (convencional e agroecologico) com tres repeticoes, cada uma numa area de 400 m2, totalizando 1200m2 por tratamento. Para a analise social foi utilizada uma abordagem qualitativa, os dados foram coletados por meio de entrevistas. A entrevista teve por objetivo captar as mudancas que ocorreram na vida dos agricultores ao optarem pelo sistema de producao agroecologico. A eficiencia energetica foi estimada por meio dos experimentos instalados nas comunidades estudadas. Foram contabilizadas as entradas de energia (insumos, maquinarios, combustivel, mao-de-obra) e a saida de energia (gr{\~a}o produzido). Com esses dados, calculou-se a eficiencia energetica, atraves da formula E = Saida/Entrada. Com relacao aos resultados de custos de producao, o sistema agroecologico se apresentou como o de menor custo para o agricultor. Na comunidade de Marmeleiro, o sistema agroecologico propiciou um saldo final positivo para o agricultor em relacao ao sistema convencional, que manteve o agricultor com uma renda final negativa. Nas demais comunidades os dois sistemas apresentaram uma renda final negativa, porem o sistema convencional gerou um prejuizo superior ao agricultor em relacao ao sistema agroecologico. Quanto a analise social ficou evidente a melhor qualidade de vida obtida pelo agricultor ao optar pelo sistema de produ{\c c}{\~a}o agroecologico. Os principais beneficios obtidos por meio da conversao do sistema de producao foram; seguindo uma ordem de importancia: a sa{\'u}de melhorou, aumentou o tempo, a vida comunitaria e familiar melhoraram, entre outros. Um aspecto que se demonstrou importante foi a retomada de praticas como a troca de servicos e o mutirao, ou seja, a solidariedade e a uniao da comunidade foram fortalecidas e consequentemente obteve-se uma melhora geral na vida do agricultor. Quanto a analise ecoenergetica ficou demonstrada uma superioridade da eficiencia energetica do sistema agroecologico em relacao ao sistema convencional. A eficiencia energetica para a cultura do milho no sistema agroecologico foi de 5,43 e 9,33, ja para o sistema convencional o resultado obtido foi de 2,42 e 3,65. Para a cultura do feijao os resultados foram os seguintes: sistema agroecologico 1,10 e 3,73 e sistema convencional 0,79 e 0,93..},

        abstract = {In this paper, a systematic review approach was used to evaluate how environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has
been applied in agroforestry in the context of food systems. This review was used as the basis for discussing methodological issues in the LCA framework for agroforestry systems (AFS) and relevant environmental outcomes in the agroforestry literature. A total of 32 LCAs in 17 countries identified in four databases and spanning a decade form the
basis for this paper. Studies were selected based on pre-defined inclusion criteria and followed established guidelines and a review protocol. Qualitative data were extracted and categorized into multiple themes. Results were quantitatively synthesized for the four phases of the LCA for each individual agroforestry practice (i.e., based on its structural composition). Results showed that around half of the selected studies are located in tropical climates, the rest being in temperate climates, predominantly in Southern Europe. Studies primarily used a mass functional unit and rarely included post-farmgate system boundaries. Almost half of the studies account for multifunctionality, and most allocation methods were based on physical properties. Climate change had the greatest coverage from all impact categories with some variations within milk, meat, and crop production systems. Methodological issues were related to limited system boundaries, few impact categories, and differing functional units and  multifunctionality approaches. The identified effects
of AFS on biodiversity, climate change mitigation, water, soil, pollination, and pest and disease were only partially
documented or not analyzed in the LCA studies or the LCA framework. Gaps in knowledge and limitations of
the present review were discussed. Further methodological improvements remain necessary to determine the net environmental effects of food products resulting from individual AFS, especially within the area of multifunctionality, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity.}

        abstract = {Agricultural activities contribute to several environmental problems that lead to environmental degradation (FAO, 2013). These problems include biodiversity loss and climate change (Knudsen et al., 2019). In order to address some of these issues, a variety of alternative farming systems have been proposed (Garibaldi et al., 2017). Agroforestry Systems (AFS) are one such alternative where trees, crops
or livestock can be combined (FAO, 2013; Garibaldi et al., 2017). The question of whether AFS are favorable for the environment can be investigated through a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) (Baumann \& Tillman, 2004). Unlike monocultures or specialized livestock systems, the assessment of the effects and interactions of AFS on the environment are far more complex. It is therefore important to explore how the existing methodological choices in current LCA studies of AFS capture fundamental elements grounded in the general literature of agroforestry. Thus, the objective of this abstract is twofold. First, to identify, select and review a collection of LCA studies of AFS that focus on the provision of food. Second, to critically analyze gaps in knowledge in narrative and descriptive forms. To achieve this abstracts objective, a preliminary systematic review was conducted. The review was based on pre-defined inclusion criteria following established guidelines and protocols (Bilotta et al., 2014; Zumsteg et al., 2012). 
Preliminary results suggest that in the past decade, the most prevalent studied AFS were agrosilvicultural.
This was followed by silvopastoral and agrosilvopastoral to a lesser extent. Shade trees, cattle and cereals were the main agroforestry components addressed by the literature. Geographically, studies were concentrated in tropical zones, mainly in South America. Only a handful of studies were in temperate regions, such as Southern Europe. Most functional units were based on mass or area, followed by monetary, energy or composite units. Systems boundaries were primarily defined from cradle to gate. 
The reviewed studies focused on three major impact categories: climate change, eutrophication potential and acidification potential. Environmental hotspots were mainly linked to upstream emissions (e.g. fertilizers, animal feed and agrochemicals) followed by downstream emissions (e.g. diesel, soil management and enteric fermentation).
The preliminary results suggest a great deal of variation among the reviewed studies and their methodological choices across the four phases of an LCA. In addition to challenging the interpretation, this variation may hinder the understanding of the possible impacts of AFS on gri-food systems. Thus, the development of AFS indicators may require further exploration and incorporation into LCA since they have not been specifically outlined in the existing LCA literature.}

        abstract = {This thesis intends to evaluate, develop and test different qualitative methods and ways of ex-post assessing the impacts and contribution of the research on innovation processes and the society, in relation to the transition to organic agriculture. 
We have conducted two case studies focusing on the transition to organic farming. First is the Camargue case (in France) that encompasses a broad range of technical innovations. Second is on the development of the organic product Ecostop to protect bees against the varroatosis disease in Bulgaria. 
We evaluate the potential of a broad approach based on the Participatory Impact Pathway Analysis (PIPA) and adapted \& complemented by several other methods (first article, part 4), as well as the potential of the Social Network Analysis (SNA) (second paper, part 5) and of the Actor Network Theory (ANT) (third paper, part 6), in evaluating ex-post the impacts and contribution of the research. We study the impacts of the research in the Camargue and how they were generated. The Bulgarian case is only used to evaluate the potential of ANT (together with the Camargue case). 
The approach based on PIPA allows assessing successfully the impacts and contribution of the research. We could show that the research contributed to change in the Camargue by developing co-learning interactions with farmers although this was not critical to the success of the innovation as a whole. The agricultural policies, economic factors, the testing conducted independently by farmers, and the institutional framework, were the most important and influential factors. With respect to SNA, it was of interest to validate stakeholders? views on actors? relationships and their implications on the transition to organic farming. For example, the growing role played by INRA (National Research Agronomic Institute) within the actor network was confirmed as well as its contribution to the transition. As to ANT, it allows highlighting interpersonal actors? relationships and their effects on the innovation development. We particularly underline the importance of opinion leaders in the phases of implementation and diffusion; and also show the importance of problematizing the issues to be tackled in order to increase the success of research programs.},

The study showed that the implementation of alternative GIN control practices can be economically profitable.

The simplicity to use or implement the alternative practices and the experience level of the farmers seem to play a positive role in adoption of the alternative practices consisting of more targeted and strategic treatments.

           title = {ECOLOGICAL WEED MANAGEMENT},
        abstract = {Nowadays there is much concern over environmental and human health impacts on weed management practices which has led agricultural producers and scientists in many countries to seek innovative strategies for weed control. As weed management systems are being developed, ecological knowledge will become more and more important and the complexity of weed management must be considered. Therefore understanding weed-crop ecology will lead to more effective weed prevention, management, and control through a full range of factors regulating weed density, growth, and competitive ability. These alternative approaches for suppressing weed growth and reproduction is called ?ecological weed management?. Ecological weed management involves the use of different types of information and various control tactics in order to develop strategies for subjecting weeds to multiple variable stresses over time. The main purpose for developing ecological weed management strategies is to integrate the options and tools that are available to make the cropping system un-favorable for weeds and to minimize the impact of any weeds that survive. Many of the components of an ecological management system are inextricably intertwined, thus making it difficult to measure the individual contributions of specific elements of the systems. This Ph.D. project provides an implementation of the knowledge regarding the ecological management of the weed in a Mediterranean area of central Italy. Therefore the main objective of this study was to evaluate and optimize the contribution of several ecological approaches for enhancing weed management in both organic and conventional cropping systems in order to reduce the crop loss due to weed competition and to monitor the evolution of weed community composition. After examining the principles of weed science and evolution on weed control and/or management, the Ph.D. thesis provides information regarding ecological approaches of integrated weed management on chickpea and pepper crops through field and laboratory experiments. Field experiments were planned for evaluating how tillage and cultivation practices, competitive cultivars, cover crops and their residue management can be carried out to reduce weed germination, growth, and competitive ability. The experiments were carried out in the period 2009 ? 2011 at the experimental farm ?Nello Lupori? of Tuscia University in Viterbo, central Italy (310 m above sea level, latitude 42?24?53?? North and longitude 12?03?55?? East) on a clay loam soil classified as Typic Xerofluvent (Soil Taxonomy). Chapter 5.a. describes a field study which was carried out in order to evaluate the competitive ability and the yield response of different chickpea genotypes against one of the main key-weeds (Polygonum aviculare L.) of the Mediterranean environment. Experimental treatments consisted in six chickpea genotypes and four different P. aviculare densities (4, 8, 16, 32 plants m-2). P. aviculare seeds were mixed with dry sand and hand-sown on chickpea rows, just after chickpea sowing. P. aviculare caused an average chickpea seed yield loss of 14, 46, 74 and 88\% at the
density of 4, 8, 16, 32 plants m-2 compared to the weed-free crop, although significant losses on yield depended on the combined effect of chickpea genotypes and P. aviculare densities. The results suggest that P. aviculare should have a plant density less than 4 plants per m2 in order to prevent severe chickpea seed yield loss, although the use of highly competitive and weed-tolerant chickpea genotypes could reduce the seed yield loss up to 10\%.
Chapter 5.b. reports a field experiment carried out in order to assess the competitive ability of selected chickpea genotypes grown as pure stand and in mixture with natural weed infestation partially suppressed by inter-row tillages. Experimental treatments consisted in six chickpea genotypes and four different weed managements [no weed control (weedy); 1-hoeing performed at 25 DAE (days after chickpea emergence); 2-hoeings, one performed at 25 and one at 50 DAE; weed-free]. Weed competition did not appear to affect the length of the chickpea cropping period, but resulted in reductions in both chickpea aboveground biomass and grain yield, even if the negative effect of weed competition was firstly observed in the seed yield reduction and later in the accumulation of the dry matter, as confirmed by the significant and positive correlations between the weed aboveground biomass and the number of fruitless pods. However, the chickpea yield loss, due to natural weed infestation, varied according to the level of mechanical weed management. As expected, the mechanical weeding caused a general reduction in weed density and biomass, an increase in both the competitive ability and the relative biomass of chickpea, and a decline of the relative biomass of the weeds. However, the chickpea genotypes greatly differed in their competitive ability against the weeds at different weed management levels. The chickpea aboveground biomass in the earlier stages, the ground coverage and the plant height were the
traits that positively associated with competitive ability, and the increase of these parameters could lead to the improvement of the competitive ability of chickpea genotypes against the weeds. Therefore, our results highlight that these screenable traits could be positively evaluated in breeding programs with the aim of developing high competitive chickpea cultivars. It is clear that competitive ability alone is not sufficient for suppressing weeds in chickpea crops and it needs to be combined with other types of weed management such as mechanical weeding. The results of this research show that seed yield loss due to incomplete weed control performed with inter-row tillage, could be considerably reduced by choosing highly competitive chickpea
genotypes which could be an integral part of an environmentally-friendly weed management strategy. Chapter 5.c. reports the results of a cover crop/pepper sequence in order to evaluate the effect of different cover crop species and their residue managements on weed control and fruit yield of a pepper crop. The treatments consisted in: (a) three winter cover crops (hairy vetch, oat, canola) and bare soil; (b) three cover crop residue managements [residues left in strips on soil surface in no-tillage (NT), green manure residues at 10 cm of soil depth in minimum tillage (MT), and green manure residues at 30 cm of soil depth in conventional tillage (CT)]; (c) three levels of weed management applied to the pepper crop [weed free (WF), inter-row mechanical control applied at 30 days after pepper transplanting (WH), and weedy (W)]. Oat was the most weed suppressive cover crop compared to canola and hairy vetch both throughout the cover crop growing period and in the following pepper crop regardless the different cover crop residue managements, probably due to its severe chemical and physical effects. The conversion of cover crop aboveground biomass in mulch strips in NT conditions was clearly the most effective weed management strategy compared to MT and CT especially when hairy vetch and oat were adopted. Even if the inclusion of an inter-row hoeing in the early growing stage of the pepper determined a strong weed reduction in all residue management treatments, it only proved to be a suitable weed
control practice in NT, while in MT and CT conditions it may still be necessary to use additional means for controlling the weeds, such as herbicides or other tillage operations. Regardless cover crop management, hairy vetch determined a marketable pepper yield of about 40 t ha-1 of FM in weed-free conditions and in any case almost twice than canola and oat in presence of weeds. The inclusion of legume cover crops in vegetable crop sequences in no-tillage systems could be a part of an ample strategy for reducing the amount of chemical inputs used both for controlling weeds and for N-fertilizing vegetable crops in the Mediterranean environment. Chapter 5.d. describes the results of a field experiment carried out in order to evaluate the effect
of cover crop species and their residue management on weed community composition and weed species diversity in a winter cover crop/pepper sequence. The treatments consisted in: (a) three winter cover crops [hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.), oat (Avena sativa L.), canola (Brassica napus L.)] and bare soil; (b) three cover crop residue managements [residues left in strips on soil surface in no-tillage (NT), green manure residues at 10 cm of soil depth in minimum tillage (MT), and green manure residues at 30 cm of soil depth in conventional tillage (CT)]. Oat residues generally showed a higher reduction of weed species density, weed species richness and Shannon's index compared to hairy vetch and canola. The conversion of cover crop aboveground biomass in mulch strips (NT) greatly reduced weed species density but this did not always imply a reduction of weed species diversity in pepper compared to shallow and deep green manuring (MT and CT). In fact, the weed species richness and Shannon?s index were reduced inside the pepper rows, where the mulch was left on the soil surface, while a richer and more diverse weed community was found outside the pepper rows where the soil was not mulched. These results suggest that the cover crop residues converted into mulch strips can represent a more sustainable approach of weed management compared to green manure. In fact in NT it is possible to reduce the weed density and consequently to increase the pepper yield while maintaining a high level of weed diversity indices and evenness achieving a low agro-ecosystem disturbance. },

Animals have been used for food, services, non-food or religious purposes or just as a hobby for thousands of years. Man-made breeding has created livestock that are adapted for different purposes and functions.
Today, thousand of breeds exist: adapted to the various conditions in human households.
The discussion of animal welfare and the definition of standards for livestock keeping have to consider the different functions, ethical values and perceptions of people involved (Badura, 1999). The differences of culture, as well as private and common wealth between individuals, regions and countries, can be a reason for different standards for animal keeping. This discussion can become easier with an understanding of the functions of animals from a historical and ethical perspective. This can help to answer the question of how the animals should be kept.},

        abstract = {Organic agriculture can and should play an important role in solving future challenges in producing food. The low level of external inputs combined with knowledge on sustainablity minimizes environmental contamination and can help to produce more food for more people without negatively impacting our environment. Organic agriculture not only includes farming as a production practice but it also includes processing, trade and consumption. Nevertheless, Organic agriculture must always evolve to overcome emerging challenges. Science-based knowledge attained through dedicated research is required to strengthen organic food and farming as a means to solve future challenges. In 2010, a global discussion about Organic 3.0 was initiated to address current problems our agri-food systems are facing. Many scientifically and practically proven results are already available to make organic agriculture a strong tool to solve some of these challenges. However, the organic agri-food system has to be developed further to fulfill its potential. The contribution of organic agriculture to help solve current problems linked to food security and environmental quality was discussed during the International Society of Organic Agricultural Research (ISOFAR) Symposium ?Organic 3.0 is Innovation with Research?, held September 20?22, 2015, in conjunction with the first ISOFAR International Organic Expo, in Goesan County, Republic of Korea. Some of the world?s most active scientists in organic agriculture attended the symposium. This paper is a result of their discussions and aims to give an overview of research conducted and required to strengthen organic agriculture in its ambitions to overcome agronomic challenges, contribute to food security and protect our common environment.}

Results revealed that the cumulative effects of farmyard manure (FYM) and green manure (GM) were more effective than their direct and residual effects and GM was significantly superior to FYM for increasing the productivity, nutrient uptake, grain quality and gross and net income of wheat in the rice-wheat cropping system. Further,inoculation of biofertilizers (B) with GM was better than GM alone in its cumulative effect. The combination of GM + FYM was still better than GM or FYM alone in its direct and cumulative effects for increasing productivity and gross return, but net return was significantly reduced due to the higher cost of GM + FYM compared to FYM or GM alone. However, the residual effect of GM + FYM was similar to the cumulative effects of GM or FYM alone. The highest increase in productivity, grain quality and nutrient uptake was recorded with the application of GM + FYM + B. However, net return was significantly reduced due to the higher cost incurred in the combination of GM + FYM + B. It was concluded that the cumulative effect of GM + FYM + B for higher productivity and the cumulative effect of GM + B for higher net return were suitable for wheat in organic farming of the rice-wheat cropping system.},

Following a preliminary screening on cover crop functional traits (Step 1), we identified 8 species belonging to 4 functional groups: large seeded legumes, characterized by higher height (Pisum sativum L., Vicia sativa L.), small seeded legumes, able to cover quickly the soil (Trifolium incarnatum L., T. squarrosum L.), highly competitive grasses (Hordeum vulgare L., Avena sativa L.) and allelopathic brassicas (Raphanus sativus L., Brassica nigra L.).
We designed 4 two-species mixtures, 4 four-species mixtures and 1 eighth-species mixtures and set a gradient of diversity: (i) pure stands; (ii) co-presence of 2 functional groups; (iii) diversity within 2 co-occurring functional groups, (iv) co-presence of 4 functional groups, (v) diversity within 4 co-occurring functional groups. The trial was conducted in an organic field located in Pisa, Italy. Experimental plots were seeded on 27 October 2014 following a randomized complete block design with three replicates, and devitalized on 6 May 2015. Weed biomass was significantly lower in mixtures with the higher level of diversity compared to the unweeded control (from -87\% up to -97\%). Cover crop mixtures proved to e more productive than pure stands, since Land Equivalent Ratio was \&gt;1 in all but one mixture. For some species, biomass production was higher in high diversity mixtures compared to pure stands.
Functional diversity in cover crops can play a key role on biomass productivity and weed suppression. Data will be analysed to clarify the role of functional composition on cover crops agroecosystem services provision.},

        abstract = {Grass-clover mixtures are essential in many low-N-input cropping systems, but the importance of various root fractions for the below-ground N dynamics are not well understood. This may be due to the difficulties of studying root longevity and turnover in situ in mixtures. The present field study, investigated (1) the development in root biomass over two growing seasons and (2) the turnover of dual N-15- and C-14-labelled ryegrass and white clover root material. Litter bags containing various dual-labelled plant materials were incubated in cylinders inserted in the topsoil of a young ryegrass-clover ley. Disappearance of C-14 and N-15 from the litter bag material were studied for 1 year following incubation. Four times during two growing seasons, roots were divided into two classes: large roots, retained on a 1-cm sieve, and small roots, passing a 1-cm sieve but retained on a 100-A mu m sieve. Large root biomass increased during the two growing seasons, and small root biomass increased during the growing seasons but decreased during autumn and winter. White clover roots lost C-14 and N-15 almost twice as fast as ryegrass roots. The disappearance pattern of C-14 and N-15 from dual-labelled ryegrass and white clover roots and the C and N contents of the recovered root material indicate that large roots are determining soil C pool build-up, whereas small roots determine soil N pool build-up.}

In this issue, we have collected a number of papers relevant for the theme Organic 3.0. This special issue of Organic Agriculture about Organic 3.0 is published in connection to the science track ?Innovative research for Organic 3.0? at the Organic World Congress in Delhi, India, November 2017. In the foreword to the proceedings (Rahmann et al. 2017), the challenges listed correspond well to those described and discussed in these five papers. The fact that the paper by Rahmann et al. (2016) that has been online in Organic Agriculture since December 2016, already after 6 months has been downloaded more than 3,000 times shows the great interest in this subject. Together, these papers give a valuable basis for the further discussion of Organic 3.0 and the future development for the organic sector and beyond. Organic agriculture{--}whether 2.0 or 3.0{--}can be one option to solve future problems, and the ideas behind organic agriculture should be integrated as much as possible in many types of agriculture: agroecological, small-holder, conventional, conservation tillage, etc. But organic agriculture should also learn from conventional and other types of agriculture and if necessary take a critical view on, e.g., minimum requirements that result in negative effects on public goods. Governments, NGO?s, farmers, researchers, and other stakeholders should all contribute to developing organic as well as other forms of agriculture. It is our hope that this special issue will be one step in bringing organic and truly sustainable agriculture forward.}

        abstract = {The basic references and textbooks of organic farming describe this agricultural method as aiming at and using the benefits of a certain farm structure. Similar concepts and ideas of a farm have been described both by the pioneers of organic farming and by the pioneers of agricultural sciences, although using various terms: agricultural individuality (Steiner in 1924), self-sufficient organic whole (Lord Northbourne in 1940), the proportioned farm (Young in 1770), the farm organism (Koepf in 1976), the branches of a farm are like organs in a body (Aereboe in 1920) having a certain size and being dependent from each other (Brinkmann in 1922). The various terms, ideas and aspects are explained and compared with each other.

In the 1970s and 1980s, some decades later than most of these references have been published, scientific activities called ecosystem research have been undertaken to investigate the structures and processes in natural or almost natural ecosystems as well as in agricultural ecosystems. Particularly, the effects and the significance of human impact (e.g. tillage, fertilization, plant protection) as regards structure, functioning and long-term stability or productivity of agroecosystems have been investigated. These results considered in the light of experiences gained in both organic and conventional farming practice can explain the linkage between structures and functions of a farm, i.e. why not only a certain diversity but also a ceratin set of operation (?impacts?) is necessary for the long-term fertility and sustainability of a farm if it is managed organically.

Different, partly the opposite consequences can be observed with the specialisation versus the diversification of the farm organism. The effects of agronomic tools and techniques mainly depend on whether they support the ability of self-regulation in agroecosystems or they act as an external (anthropogenic) regulation, as different types of feedback can be provoked in the system.

The paper is a contribution to the general concept of organic farming and to the present tendency in organic farming practice to accept more simple, specialized farms.}

Due to interactions between crop and livestock enterprises and between levels of different input factors and their effects on yields, it is proposed to analyze agricultural energy utilization through system modelling of data from farm studies. Energy use in small grains, grass-clover and fodder beets registered in organic and conventional mixed dairy farms was analyzed and used together with crop yields in order to model energy prices on three Danish soil types. Conventional crop yields were higher but they also used more indirect energy with input factors, especially fertilizers. The conventional yields were not sufficiently higher to compensate for the extra use of energy compared with the organic crops. The organic crops had lower energy prices on all soil types, with the smallest difference on irrigated sandy soils. Sensitivity analyses were made for the effects of changes in irrigation and fertilizer levels. One conclusion was that better energy utilization in grain crops might be found at intermediate levels of fertilizer use, especially on irrigated soils. Actual farm diesel use was on average 47\% higher than expected from standard values, suggesting that care should be taken when basing energetic analysis of farming methods on experimental data alone. On the same farms, the energy use in dairy production registered in organic and conventional mixed dairy farms was analyzed and used together with milk and meat yields in order to model energy prices for three different feeding strategies and two soil types. Conventional dairy production is more intensive with a greater feeding ration and a higher proportion of high-protein Seed, but has also higher yields. The conventional yields were not sufficiently higher to compensate for rite extra use of energy compared with the organic feeding ration. However, the loll er energy price in organic dairy production is dependent on the composition of the feeding strategy. Substitution of 500 SFU of grain with grass pellets makes an ordinary organic feeding ration based on conventional crop production competable. In general, the crop energy price models car? be used together with the dairy production to model the effects of different feeding and crop rotation strategies on the overall energy utilization in mixed dairy production systems.}

        abstract = {The position taken in this study is that long run sustainability is a complex and context dependent concept, implying that the estimation of value depends on the issues at stake, the decision actors involved and the criteria being emphasised. Sustainability connects the economic process explicitly to the natural environment and the study elucidates how thermodynamics can supplement, although not substitute economic analyses. Both natural and social systems are multidimensional and changes are difficult to assess in a simple, one-dimensional way. The standard assumptions in many decision methods concerning rationality are thus hardly adequate. 

The empirical focus is on agricultural production and wastewater handling and in four papers decision supporting tools presuming different types of criteria, scales and degrees of commensurability are analysed. In paper 1, energy utilisation in crop and dairy production systems is analysed through systems modelling showing that variation across different production intensities, thus giving valuable information for the evaluation of the sustainability of various systems. In paper 2, an LP-model is used to find cost-efficient combinations of wastewater systems given a restriction on total pollutant load to a recipient. In paper 3 it is observed that a shift from a household strategy to a recipient strategy is allocatively cost-efficient and increases flexibility. Still the household strategy dominates in praxis. The paper discusses reasons for this i.e., transaction costs, implicit rights modifications and loss aversion. In paper 4, a multicriteria planning model is used to handle value incommensurability when choosing between waste water systems. This is done through an explicit process where different decision actors articulate their preferences.

In order to assess long-term effects on productivity, environmental impacts and soil fertility of contrasting farming practices, six cropping systems, ranging from conventional arable without livestock to organic mixed dairy farming with few arable crops, have been compared since 1989 on a loam soil. 

A decline in soil structure quality was found in a conventional arable system with annual ploughing with no rotational grass. This system had higher bulk density and mean aggregate size than other systems, and lower levels of plant available water and aggregate stability. Opposite trends were related to the proportion of grass leys in the other systems and to their levels of soil organic matter. The latter declined markedly over 15 years in the conventional arable system, and there were smaller declines in most other systems. In an arable system without ploughing, but with rotary tillage in spring, organic matter was maintained and high structural stability was found. This system had high bulk density, but the proportion of small aggregates equalled that found in systems with ley. 

There were overall increases in earthworm density (84\%), earthworm biomass (80\%) and the density of earthworm channels (132\%) in the topsoil between 1994 and 2004. Most of these increases were found in systems with 1?3 years of ley in the 4-year rotation. Low values of all earthworm parameters, and only minor changes over the period studied, were found in two non-organic arable systems without ley, indicating high pressure on soil fauna. Lower earthworm activity was found in the non-organic arable system with reduced tillage as compared to the non-organic arable system with annual ploughing. Thus, 50\% leys in the rotation appeared desirable for the maintenance of satisfactory soil structure and earthworm activity. Though the deterioration of soil structure in the conventional arable system was not extreme, as the soil was well structured initially, the results may have implications for the sustainability of stockless arable systems on soils with a less favourable initial structure.},

Por esta raz{\'o}n su control qu{\'i}mico se realiza con altas concentraciones de insecticidas que aumentan la contaminaci{\'o}n ambiental y los peligros para la salud humana. Las tend{\^e}ncias actuales en el manejo integrado de plagas se orientan hacia el uso de plaguicidas biol{\'o}gicos o biopesticidas como los extractos vegetales, que no generan resistencia y son de baja toxicidad. En ese sentido, el objetivo del presente trabajo fue estudiar la actividad repelente e insecticida del aceite esencial de Lippia alba (Verbenaceae) quimiotipo carvona-limoneno sobre adultos de T. castaneum, en granos de trigo. La repelencia fue evaluada a las 2 y 24 h y a los 7, 14 y 21 d{\'i}as utilizando un olfat{\'o}metro y una concentraci{\'o}n Del aceite esencial de 52 {\ensuremath{\mu}}L L-1 de aire.

        abstract = {As part of a wider concern with sustainability issues, throughout Europe there is increasing interest in alternative food supply chains. Local and organic food (LOF) is gradually gaining ground also among institutional customers. Public food purchases are constrained by the legal framework of the EU law on public procurement. The law encourages the use of most economically advantageous tender (MEAT), which enables the contracting authority to take into account criteria other than only the lowest price.
One of the restrictions in increasing the use of LOF items in institutional kitchens is the tedious procurement process. Using a case study approach, this paper explores the tendering process and its development from price-based competitive bidding towards anticipatory dialogue and interaction between the suppliers and catering personnel. The implications for SMESs are discussed.
It is concluded that when the purchasing know-how is used wisely public catering constitutes a protected space for the SME:s to develop. The most important steps in increasing LOF in public catering are taken at local level. It requires local policy makers? strategic decisions and strong commitment to long-term development work. Access to LOF items vary, and the goals in increasing the use of LOF need to be defined so as to address the case-specific circumstances and by paying due attention to the experts by experience, i.e. the actors of the catering sector and their customers. Important ingredients are the role of the path-breaking municipalities and exchange of experiences both nationally and internationally.},

        abstract = {The strategic goal of the Finnish food policy is to develop agriculture and food production as a sector of strong expansion. Since 2010, the role of organic food is specifically stressed in strivings to improve the competitiveness of the Finnish food sector.

Recognising the significance of the statutory public catering in Finland, the focus here is the organic food in the context of public catering. The article examines the discourse articulated in food policy documents, the use of organic food within municipal food services and the materialised efforts to increase its use. Finnish experiences are discussed by considering the competitive tendering process constrained by regulations on public procurement and the role of the public catering services for the SMEs in the heavily competitive food markets. The aim is to improve actors? knowledge regarding the possibilities of the institutional consumers to increase the use of organic food. Despite the good intentions articulated in the policy documents, expanding the use of organic food in institutional kitchens is a slow process. It requires that the bottlenecks are identified and opened in the real-life context. Increased organic consumption in public catering is primarily a political decision. Its adoption requires determined will, and the local policymakers are in a key position to decide, whether organic food should be favoured. This requires strategic decisions and a strong commitment to long-term development work. The options for including and/or increasing organic food in public catering should be considered when formulating comprehensive municipal development strategies. It is important to pay attention to the research results, to involve practical actors and to appreciate the caterers? expertise as well as the customers? experiences regarding the various quality aspects. Municipal customers are important for the SME:s, who often have difficulties to get foothold in the heavily competitive food markets. Long-term contracts provide secure income and the entrepreneurs can then better concentrate on developing their core business. To establish the customership, both the entrepreneurs and the municipal purchasers need thorough knowledge on the purchasing procedure.},

        abstract = {In Norway, cover crops were introduced to prevent loss of nitrogen and phosphorous from fields to waterways. Today, cover crops are also used to restore soil organic matter and improve soil health. Yet, the direction and magnitude of these effects are variable, and little is known about the persistence of the C derived from the cover crops in the soil. In the CAPTURE project, we evaluated the soil C sequestration potential from different cover crops used in the main cereal production areas in Norway. To do so, we used pulse labelling with 13C (CO2) to label four different cover crop species Italian ryegrass, phacelia, oilseed radish and summer vetch through their growing period. Cover crops were grown in a monoculture to enable the labelling. The results of the first year of the experiment show that cover crops produced 10- 14 Mg ha-1 above ground biomass, corresponding to 4-6 Mg C ha-1. At the end of the growing season, 3-5\% of cover crop C was found in the soil particulate organic matter (POM) fraction and 2-4\% in the soil mineral organic matter fraction (MAOM). In the following years, the fate of C derived from the cover crops in the soil will be determined. Furthermore, the soil C sequestration of the different cover crops will be scaled to barley plots in the same experiment, to which cover crops had been undersown in spring or summer. In these plots, N2O emissions have been measured through the whole year. The greenhouse gas trade-offs of cover crops in Norwegian cereal production will be estimated.},

        abstract = {Organic milk production was established at Tingvoll experimental farm in 1989, replacing the previous conventional sheep production.

Soil samples for concentrations of nutrients and soil organic matter (SOM) have been taken every 5?7-year intervals since 1990, and grass-clover yields have been annually measured since 1991. Overall, changes in SOM concentration and nutrient content in the topsoil (0-20 cm) were greater than in the subsoil (20-40 cm). In the topsoil, in the cultivated areas, SOM concentration and plant-available phosphorus (P-AL), calcium (Ca-AL) and magnesium (Mg-AL), were lower in 2021 than 1991. Potassium (K-AL) content has increased from 1991 to 2021. In permanent pastures, the SOM concentrations were higher than in cultivated areas. Overall, decrease in SOM and soil fertility may be related to the land use change, high initial contents, soil drainage, and climate change. The average air temperature in the growing season has increased about 0.05? C per year during the 30-year period, and three cuts of the ley instead of two cuts per year became more often. The yield of the first cut of the ley has slightly decreased since 1991, but the quality of the ley and the proportion of grass and clover has been stable until the fifth production year within each crop rotation.},

        abstract = {Anaerobic digestion of animal manure can help farmers to produce renewable energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Compared to non-digested slurry, digested slurry has a reduced content of organic matter, which may affect the soil fertility and crop productivity in the long-term. Hence, a field experiment with two slurry-application levels (ca. 110 vs. 220 kg of total N ha-1 year-1) was established in 2011, to study how application of anaerobic digested slurry (ADS) versus untreated dairy cow slurry (US) affects soil characteristics and crop yields. Anaerobic digestion of the slurry did not affect soil concentrations of extractable nutrients and pH, but the rate of slurry application did. A decline in SOM in all the plots from 2011-2021, contrasts with our expectations that long-term application of slurry would increase the SOM concentrations in the topsoil. The decrease of SOM concentrations (0-20 cm) was faster on plots with high intrinsic SOM ({\ensuremath{>}} ca 10 \% ignition loss), and did not differ among slurry treatments. Higher slurry application rate led to a surplus of N, while a deficit was observed in the control and the treatments with low application rates. Treatments were not limited by P. Even in the treatments with low application rate, the total P deficit was minimal, 18 kg P ha-1 across 2011-2021. For K, there was a deficit in all treatments. US and ADS gave similar yields of grass-clover ley, on average 7.9 Mg DM ha-1 year-1. Clover biomass was similar in manured treatments and the non-fertilized control. Anaerobic digestion of the slurry before its application into soil did not seem to reduce grassland productivity or soil fertility in the long term, but the decline in SOM over time deserves attention.},

The aim of this research is to develop a framework of International Community Supported Agriculture (ICSA) and to identify potentials of such a framework regarding a sustainable development of global food systems. The foundation for this is the development of a landscape of unsustainability in global food systems. Containing different features, it is thereby giving an overview on the current and unsustainable state of global food systems. Four approaches are presented that address sustainability in food systems: CSA, Fairtrade, crowd-based and direct-trade approaches (combining Teekampagne and Crowdfarming), and Teikei Coffee. These are assessed regarding their potentials, challenges, and limitations to address unsustainability in global food systems. Basis of this assessment is a thorough literature analysis and an interview with an expert from Teikei Coffee. Key potentials are identified and brought linked to the features of unsustainability, which are then picked up within the framing of ICSA. The result is a framework which shows potentials to address all features of unsustainability, as have been identified in this thesis. The framework of ICSA and the landscape of unsustainability may be relevant for further research and for practitioners with the interest to foster a sustainable development of global food systems.},

        abstract = {The practice of breeding several animal species at the same time has accompanied the history of humans and is still widespread in many areas of the planet.
In recent decades, multi-species livestock farming has attracted the interest of numerous researchers to understand any positive contributions to improve the level of sustainability of agro-zootechnical systems and has fully entered the set of methods suggested for the management of organic farming.
The Mix-Enable project (Mixed livestock farming for improved sustainability and robustness of organic livestock), funded by CoreOrganic and for which 10 research institutions are involved (INRAE, BOKU, CRAW, FIBL, Forschungsring eV, IDELE, ITAB, SLU , TI-O and University of Tuscia), explored these characteristics on a sample of 102 organic farms in Europe (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and Switzerland), detecting a series of information through a specific questionnaire administered to owners during the period October 2018-July 2019. The data collected (summarized in 1574 variables) were validated and subsequently used to build a set of indicators that could describe the main aspects of multi-species farming.
Multi-species husbandry is to be considered a valid "rediscovery" for livestock farming in the next future since is characterized by various positive aspects, in particular for the efficiency in the use of resources, for the conservation of biodiversity, productivity, profitability, and animal health and welfare.
The final results of the Mix-Enable project will be illustrated in a webinar on September 28, 2021, starting at 10:00. You can register at this link: http://limesurvey42.idele.fr/index.php/284171?lang=en.},

        abstract = {Agroforestry systems for cocoa production are commonly promoted for biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation and adaptation as well as for food security and risk mitigation. Generally, these systems include timber, legume or fruit trees. Sucessional or dynamic agroforestry systems represent a special type of design and management approach, using high densities and diversity of trees and crops occupying different strata and with varying life cycles.

Here we present yields of three organic cocoa production systems entering the mature stage from a long-term trial in Bolivia: A complex successional dynamic agroforestry system (SAFS), a simpler but diversified agroforestry system (AF ORG) and a cocoa monoculture (MONO ORG). Average cocoa yields in the mature phase (9-11 years) were highest in MONO ORG (1520 kg/ha), followed by the AF ORG (910 kg/ha), and lowest in SAFS (790 kg/ha) (yields considering the 8 best yielding clones out of 12. 

Total system yields in both types of agroforestry systems (dry matter) were 3.5 to 4 times higher than in monocultures over the 11 years. This was mainly due to banana production in AF ORG and from a multitude of by-crops in SAFS. 

While in young SAFS(until 8 years) crops like cassava, and pineapple were contributing to total yields, peach palm was the most relevant by-crop in the mature phase with around 4 t/ha fresh yields. Additional interesting crops were ginger and curcuma, that growing under the cocoa in SAFS yielded around 1 kg of fresh tubers per m2.

The results demonstrate how different crops can be associated with cocoa while still reaching elevated cocoa yields. The potential of agroforestry systems to sustainably intensify production on one surface is high and could still be optimised with the use of improved and locally selected varieties of cocoa and by-crops. Different designs of agroforestry systems can contribute to diversification of diets and incomes of producing families and regions.},

However, when it comes to spreading and adapting these methods to specific ecological and socio-economic contexts, we know only little about what factors influence the learning processes involved. This study aims at a thorough assessment of factors that are enabling or hindering knowledge co-production in organic farming in general and of sustainable rice farming in particular. Following a qualitative multilevel analysis, special emphasis is placed on understanding how the socio-economic, cultural and ecological context is constituted (macro-level), how key stakeholder groups collaborate and enhance societal and social learning processes (meso-level), and to what degree these processes lead to enhancement and integration of organic rice farming methods in the farmers? livelihood systems (micro-level). Case studies in South Korea and Cambodia show that capacity building and institutionalization of key actors such as farmer promoters and farmer researchers, as well as farmer group maintenance with diverse incentives for sustained participation are vital enabling factors.},

        abstract = {Flemingia macrophylla e uma leguminosa arbustiva de origem asiatica, pouco explorada e utilizada  no Brasil. A literatura destaca seu elevado potencial em diferentes sistemas agroflorestais em varias regioes tropicais do mundo. Este potencial tem sido demonstrado em nossas condicoes, tendo sido por isso escolhida esta especie para estudo. Dentre os objetivos deste estudo, destaca-se a avaliacao da rebrota de flemingia cultivada em faixas, a quantificacao da acumulacao de nitrogenio na parte aerea, bem como a avaliacao da dinamica de decomposicao de liberacao de nutrientes da folha, do caule e da combinacao de caule+folha. Para tanto, foi avaliada a capacidade da rebrota de flemingia apos cortes em diferentes alturas (0,0 m; 0,3 m; 0,6 m; 1,2 m do nivel do solo em plantas de um ano de idade. O tempo de avaliacao foi de dois anos, com a realizacao de nove cortes, onde quantificou-se a materia seca e os teores de nitrog{\^e}nio da parte aerea de flemingia e parametros biometricos como altura, diametro do caule e numero de ramificacoes. Observou-se que a flemingia apresenta excelente capacidade em rebrotar: o corte a 1,2 m chegou a produzir 34 Mg MS ha?1, equivalendo a 804 kg N ha"1 e superando os demais tratamentos como o corte a 0,6 m de altura que chegou a produzir 29 Mg MS ha' 1 e acumulou 691 kg N ha'1; o corte a 0,3 m que produziu 18 Mg MS ha"1 acumulando cerca de 329 kg N ha?1 e por fim, o corte ao nivel do solo que produziu 16 Mg MS ha?1 com acumulo de 211 kg N ha'1. O tempo de meia vida (T1/2) da decomposicao foi de 91, 95 e 97 dias para folha, caule e caule+folha, respectivamente. Quanto a liberacao de nutrientes, observou-se tempo de meia vida (T1/2) para libera{\c c}{\~a}o de nitrogenio nas folhas de 116 dias, no caule de 102 dias e na relacao caule+folha, de 99 dias. A liberacao de N ocorreu de forma mais pronunciada ate os primeirosl5 dias. O T 1/2 para liberacao de fosforo na folha foi de 81 dias, para caule de 80 dias e para caule+folha de 67 dias. Os tres tratamentos apresentaram comportamento semelhante na liberacao de potassio, sendo que o T1/2 na liberacao de K para folha foi de 21 dias, de 40 dias para o caule e de 19 dias para caule+folha. Para calcio o T 1/2 para folha foi de 235 dias, para o caule de 163 dias e para caule+folha de 168 dias. Para o magnesio o T1/2 foi de 136 dias para folha, de 159 dias para caule e de 152 dias para caule+folha. A abundancia da fauna edafica mostrou-se intensa nas primeiras avaliacoes, onde o numero total de individuos por metro quadrado passou de 500, declinando nas coletas posteriores, provavelmente devido a escassez de alimento e nutrientes, diminuindo a possibilidade de habitat aos invertebrados.

Each flock included 76 animals having access to a paddock (3.4 x 19.9 m), where material (3.4 x 3.0 x 0.2 m) was placed outside the pop-hole. The average amounts of hens? outdoors were documented at 9 am and 3 pm each day.  There was no significant difference between the materials concerning hens? distribution and they seemed to be equally comfortable. Instead weather conditions influenced hen distribution. The sub-area with material close to the house was more frequently used by hens during the hot and dry summer. The hen?s choice was promoted by a roof above the pop-hole giving shade. With lower temperatures and rain showers later the hens? distribution pattern changed significantly (P{\ensuremath{<}}0.001) and they were more evenly distributed over the paddock area during autumn.}

Many students now seek opportunities to pursue a PhD degree using a systems approach across disciplines. Interdisciplinary research in Agroecology is embraced by a dispersed group of researchers around the world, and few universities have their own capacity to offer adequate PhD courses and supervision for such interdisciplinary PhD training.  To design a new programme, we have established an international network of Agroecology researchers, advisors, and instructors from several universities in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. They were recruited to organize a post-graduate study programme in Agroecology that will provide courses and dissertation opportunities. Using a combination of distance and blended courses, regional workshops, and electronic networking, an international faculty will offer high-level education and research supervision to help talented candidates in national research programmes, universities, aid and non-profit agencies, and private industry achieve a doctoral degree. },

Methane yields in the range of 219?375 and 429?539 ml-CH4 g-VS?1 were obtained for the mono-digestion of press cake and the residual juice, respectively, and up to 81\% of the methane potential of the fresh crops was recovered in the two residual fractions when evaluated separately. Co-digestion of the press cake and the residual juice at the organic matter ratio at which those fractions leave the biorefinery, resulted in a methane yield of 400 ml-CH4 g-VS?1 according to the regression model equation developed for red clover. Consequently, 65\% of the methane potential from fresh red clover could be recovered by co-digestion of the residual fractions from the green biorefinery after extraction of proteins.},

        abstract = {There is an increasing interest in green biorefineries for the utilization of green biomass to provide a variety of valuable products. Proteins can be extracted from green biomasses such as alfalfa, clover, or grass and separated into protein-rich concentrates suitable for feeding to monogastric animals. Press cake suitable for feeding ruminant animals is also produced. Full implementation of such a green biorefinery requires knowledge and experience of production at demonstration scale. Moreover, product evaluation in animal-feeding trials requires a large amount of product. There has been collaboration in Denmark between several partners from industry and academia to assess the practicality and scalability of a green biorefining plant producing protein concentrate and press cake silage from organic grass clover at the scale of ca. 10 tons per hour fresh biomass input. Lactic acid fermentation of the pressed green juice was successfully performed to precipitate proteins and stabilize the juice. Despite minor difficulties, the demonstration-scale biorefining plant was operative for four days, processed 444 tons of grass clover, and resulted in the overall production of 1 ton of dried protein concentrate, 7 tons of protein paste, and 223 tons of press cake silage. The protein concentrate was rich in essential amino acids and was tested in feeding trials with poultry; the press cake silage, rich in processed fibers and fiber-associated proteins, was tested in feeding trials with dairycows.}

Green biorefinery concepts might become the suitable solution for the sustainable production of organic protein-rich feeds from green crops. In this context, red clover, clover grass, alfalfa and oilseed radish were studied as possible feedstocks for the development of an organic biorefinery system in Northern Europe. For this purpose, the green crops were processed into a nitrogen-rich protein concentrate, a fiber-rich press cake, and a residual stream of soluble nutrients (brown juice). The process, which involved a novel protein refining technique using lactic acid fermentation, yielded between 6 kg and 13 kg of dry organic protein product per ton of fresh crop. The protein products of the different crops presented balanced amino acid composition compared to soybeans, which are commonly used in organic farming. Moreover, methionine contents between 7.8 and 9.1 g/kg DM were obtained in the protein products, which is more than the typical concentration found in animal feeds. This makes the organic protein product produced very promising as a feed ingredient for organic farming of monogastric animals in Europe.},

Given the background, the present research aims at assessing the protein extractability from three plant species i.e. chicory, red clover and timothy, at different development stages and investigating lactic acid fermentation as the key method for the extraction of leaf proteins. Based on our results, up to 86\% of the proteins in the green juice were recovered in the leaf protein concentrate (LPC) by means of lactic acid fermentation. Red clover presented the highest protein content and resulted in the extraction of 65e98 kg crude proteins per ton dry matter and the production of 186 e235 kg dry LPC per ton dry matter. The plants development stage significantly influenced the process figures i.e. protein extractability and production of protein concentrate were reduced with maturity. Accordingly, the maturity of the plants should be addressed when utilized as feedstock for producing protein concentrates for animal feeding in order to optimize the process yields.}

A total of 22 pigs (16 castrated males and 6 females) was housed outdoor and fed ad libitum (37 ? 85 kg live weight) with a growing diet and then transferred to an indoor system (with free access to an outdoor area) for 49 days, according to 3 different treatments: 100\% concentrate (C), 75\% concentrate + ad libitum grass (CE75), 50\% concentrate + ad libitum grass (CE50). The grass was supplied and its intake registered on a daily basis. Every 14 days, the pigs were weighted and their back fat (P2 in vivo) measured. After slaughter (average weight of 107 kg LW), yield and ? left carcass characteristics were controlled. During the outdoor growing phase, the ADG was 513 g/day. During the indoor finishing phase, the increase grass intake was proportional to the reduction of concentrate in the diet. The ADG (g) and the fat deposition (P2 cm) were significantly different (P{\ensuremath{<}}0,05) in the 3 treatments (ADG: C=641, CE75=467, CE50=356 and: C=11,4, CE75=+9,5, CE50=+6,2). The empty body weight (kg) was also proportional to the intake of concentrate (C=116,2; CE75=107,7; CE50=102,2). Comparatively to the weight of the body parts, pigs that had higher intake of grass and lower of concentrate showed a higher \% of shoulder (P{\ensuremath{<}}0,05; C=20,4, CE75=21,7, CE50=22,2) and the pH45min of CE carcasses was significantly higher (P{\ensuremath{<}}0,05). As a conclusion, concentrate substitution for grass showed a slower growing rate, thinner carcasses and a high technological quality.
Neverthelles variability (CV \%) of the productive parameters at the end of this study were higher in the treatments that included grass: live weight (C= 10,5\%; C75=10,7\%; C50=14,3\%), finishing ADG (C=24\%; C75=37\%, C50=42\%), and final fat (C=37\%; C75=32\%, C50=52\%). These values suggest that the utilization of fibrous feeds in growing-finishing swine may be one of the possible explanations of the more heterogeneous products and carcasses found in the traditional or extensive systems, common users of fibrous feeds in the carcass finishing phase.},

        abstract = {Field experiments were conducted for four years to determine the effects of organic and conventional systems and fourteen varieties (nine old and five improved) on growth, yield and quality of durum wheat crop. The experiments conducted at two sites (low semi-arid and higher semi-arid) were laid out in a split-plot design with four replicates. Studied parameters included (i) grain yield, (ii) technological and nutritional quality of the whole grain, dry matter, specific weight, proteins, amino acids, mineral content, gluten and baking strength.
Results of the agronomic traits indicated that grain yield is on the average lower under organic cultivation compared to conventional methods (2.32 and 2.98 t/ha SEM=0.18 qx/ha respectively). However, varieties performance under this environment changed in dry year. Data analysis indicated high production potential of some varieties such as Khiar, Ben Bechir and INRAT69 (2.47, 2.46 and 2.44 t/ha respectively) under organic farming method. INRAT69 was found stable for grain yield under organic farming with low coefficient of variation (33 \%) and a linear regression coefficient close to one (bi=0.94). Khiar and Ben Bechir varieties, identified for organic cultivation, were unstable.
Results of the technological and nutritional quality were influenced by the cultivation method. The organic method affected positively proline contents (1.154 vs 1.146 g/100g of FM) and cyst{\'e}ine (0.216 vs 0.186 g/100g of FM) and gluten index which is responsible for the rheological properties of dough (64.73 vs 61.46 \%). Contrary to the organic method, grain protein content is better in the conventional method (13.9 vs 13.5 \%/MF, ESM=0.008 \%/MF).
Organic cultivation of INRAT69 variety was found to be associated with high nutritional and technological quality parameters such us grain weight, dry matter, total amino acids content and gluten index.
Regardless of the cultivation method, results showed that old varieties Badri, Jnah Khortifa and Hamira have high protein and total amino acids content ({\ensuremath{>}} 16 \%/FM and {\ensuremath{>}} 14.5 g/100g FM, respectively). These varieties should be considered by breeders in selection and breeding programs of durum wheat for organic farming. 
Based on these results, only INRAT69 variety could be potentially used in organic agriculture not only because its stable yield, but also because of its higher technological and nutritional quality. This variety could also be adapted for manufacturing organic pasta and couscous.},

The outcomes of this project is that first it was not necessarily clear what a framework for OFF should be, and therefore a conference of consensus was used as a methodological
tool to share views by multi-stakeholders. Second, we used sustainability assessment as an integrative process of the three levels (technical-economic, environmental, and social) and third, to manage to share a more transversal approach, we proposed a framework with 3 levels of key-proprieties: 1) security and efficiency, 2) durability through the protection of resources, and 3) autonomy and resilience.},

In the first section we show results at farm level on environmental and agro-economic performances. In the second section, we underline the challenges facing OF to confirm its prototype?s position. OF as a heterogeneous entity presents different types of trade-offs between the performances. Some performances need an up-scaling approach to be confirmed. This up-scaling enables also a more global assessment integrating the externalities of conventional farming that OF tends to internalize. Finally we conclude that other criteria should also be considered to better take into account the values and the long terms sustainability, because the contemporary systems have been constructed on optimizing productivity and maximization of short terms yields. },

        abstract = {The aim of this PhD thesis was to calculate the cost-effectiveness of organic farming in achieving environmental policy targets compared to single-agri-environmental policies.
Using a theoretical model, it was demonstrated that financial support for organic farming does not in principle contradict the Tinbergen Rule, even if there are other targeted policy measures which are more cost-effective in achieving specific environmental goals. Hence, organic farming should be included as an option within a mix of other policies as long as its costeffectiveness with respect to the overall set of policy goals is superior to that of a combination of other policy instruments.
The cost-effectiveness of agri-environmental policies can be understood as a function of policy uptake, environmental effects, and public expenditure. Taking the Swiss agricultural sector as an empirical case study, both the costs and effects of organic farming and other single agri environmental measures were calculated at sector level. Therefore, the economic sector model FARMIS was extended by three modules encompassing a) life cycle assessments for fossil energy use, biodiversity and eutrophication, b) public expenditure, including policy-related transaction costs, and c) uptake of agri-environmental policies.
The calculations revealed a slightly higher abatement cost with organic farming of 14 CHF/ha for a 1 \% average improvement in the environmental indicators, compared to a combination of three single agri-environmental policies (11 CHF/ha), including both extensification of arable land and meadows. In view of total public expenditure on agriculture of 2 to 3 kCHF per ha in Switzerland, these differences can be understood as marginal. Sensitivity analyses confirm that the cost-effectiveness of organic agriculture and combined agri-environmental policies is very similar. Thus it is concluded that financial support for organic farms in Switzerland is economically sound in view of the provision of public goods.},

          author = {C. Schader and N. Lampkin and M. Christie and M. Stolze},
        abstract = {Since 1993, the Swiss federal agricultural policy has been providing financial support for organic farming via area payments. Like other voluntary agri-environmental measures (AEM), these payments are intended as incentives for farmers to comply with defined production standards. Such payments lead to better environmental performance, as compliance with organic production standards averts negative and provides positive external effects compared to conventional or integrated farming (CRER, 2002). For instance, organic farming is largely not dependent on external inputs. This minimises the resource use of the farming system and limits the nutrient loads in the system, which in turn leads to less overfertilisation and reduced eutrophication risks involving nitrogen and phosphorus (Haas et al., 2001). Besides effectiveness, against the background of limited public budgets, efficiency in delivering environmental impacts plays a fundamental role in the further development of direct payment schemes (Swiss Federal Council, 2009). The targeting and tailoring of policies to achieve maximum effectiveness with a given budget is essential (OECD, 2007). It is therefore necessary to compare both environmental effects and the societal costs of AEM with each other in order to provide a basis for economically sound policy design (Pearce, 2005).
Agricultural economists hold differing views on the cost-effectiveness of organic farming support payments. Von Alvensleben (1998) argues that the organic farming area support payments are not economically sound, as the policy goals could be achieved more efficiently using more flexible and targeted combinations of various AEM. The economic rationale behind this argument was introduced by Tinbergen (1956), who theorised that an efficient policy requires at least as many specific instruments as there are specific goals. However, the Tinbergen Rule may not apply fully in this case due to interactions between policies, conflicting goals and the limited determinability of different aspects of environmental performance. Furthermore, the multi-purpose character of organic agriculture could increase its cost-effectiveness due to its potentially lower transaction costs compared to targeted AEM (Dabbert et al., 2004).
Empirical papers on this question lack. Thus, this paper aims to compare the cost-effectiveness of a) direct payments to organic farms and b) AEM, in providing environmental services. This is done, using the current Swiss agricultural policy scheme as a case study.},

However, looking closer at the scope, the level of assessment and the precision of indicators used for impact assessment we discern considerable differences between the sustainability impact assessment tools at hand. The aim of this paper is therefore to classify and analyse six different sustainability impact assessment tools with respect to the assessment level, the scope and the precision. From our analysis we can conclude that there is a trade-off between scope and precision of these tools. Thus one-size-fits-all solutions with respect to tool selection are rarely feasible. Furthermore, as the indicator selection determines the assessment results, different and inconsistent indicators could lead to contradicting and not comparable assessment results. To overcome this shortcoming, sustainability impact assessments should disclose the methodological approach as well as the indictor sets use and aim for harmonisation of assumptions.}

Dabei wurde versucht, soweit wie m{\"o}glich auf {\"o}sterreichische Studien zur{\"u}ckzugreifen. Falls keine {\"o}sterreichischen Studien vorlagen, wurden internationale Studien herangezogen. Aufgrund dieser Fakten wurden sieben Schlussfolgerungen gezogen, die die derzeitige gesellschaftliche Diskussion um die Reform der {\"o}sterreichischen Agrarumweltpolitik versachlichen und ihr neue Impulse geben sollen. Die Kernthese des vorliegenden Papiers ist, dass die biologische Landwirtschaft mit vergleichsweise geringen gesellschaftlichen Kosten einen h{\"o}heren gesellschaftlichen Nutzen erzielt als die konventionelle Wirtschaftsweise. Die Studie gibt Anregungen zu einer volkswirtschaftlich sinnvollen F{\"o}rderung der im Hinblick auf die {\"o}sterreichischen Agrarumweltziele multifunktionellen biologischen Landwirtschaft.
Wir kommen in unserer Analyse zu dem Schluss, dass gesellschaftlichen Leistungen und Kosten der Landwirtschaft nur unzureichend in der volkswirtschaftlichen Gesamtrechnung wiedergegeben sind. Selbst bei einer konservativen Sch{\"a}tzung und unter Nichtber{\"u}cksichtigung vieler Arten von externen Kosten der {\"o}sterreichischen Landwirtschaft belaufen sich diese auf 1,3 Milliarden Euro pro Jahr. Gem{\"a}{\ss} der wissenschaftlichen Literatur kann eindeutig von geringeren negativen Umweltwirkungen der biologischen Landwirtschaft ausgegangen werden. Wir sch{\"a}tzen die potentielle Reduktion auf mindestens ein Drittel der Gesamtkosten. Aufgrund der Wirkungen der biologischen Landwirtschaft auf verschiedene {\"o}sterreichische Agrarumweltziele ist davon auszugehen, dass die derzeitige F{\"o}rderung der biologischen Landwirtschaft im Agrar-Umweltprogramm {\"O}PUL zu Kostensenkungen f{\"u}hrt ? dies im Vergleich zu einem Ma{\ss}nahmenmix ohne F{\"o}rderung der biologischen Landwirtschaft.
Um zuk{\"u}nftig die Internalisierung von externen Effekten weiter voranzutreiben und das aufgezeigte Potential der biologischen Landwirtschaft zur volkswirtschaftlichen Kosteneinsparung voll nutzen zu k{\"o}nnen, schlagen wir insgesamt sechs Ma{\ss}nahmen, innerhalb und au{\ss}erhalb des {\"O}PUL-Programmes vor: i) Vollst{\"a}ndige Abgeltung von Kosten und eine Entkoppelung der Marktkomponente und Agrarumweltkomponente der biologischen Landwirtschaft, ii) Sicherstellen, dass die betriebswirtschaftlichen Anreize von Kombinationen von Einzelma{\ss}nahmen, die in der Bio-Landwirtschaft bereits enthalten sind, die F{\"o}rderung der Bio-Landwirtschaft nicht {\"u}bersteigen, iii) Einf{\"u}hrung von weiteren bzw. Weiterf{\"u}hrung von existierenden mit der biologischen Landwirtschaft kombinierbaren {\"O}PUL-Ma{\ss}nahmen, iv) Implementierung projektbezogener Instrumente zur F{\"o}rderung der l{\"a}ndlichen Entwicklung durch die landwirtschaftliche Produktion, v) Einf{\"u}hrung einer Stickstoff-, Energie- und Pestizidsteuer und vi) Langfristiges politisches Bekenntnis zur Unterst{\"u}tzung der biologischen Landwirtschaft.
Wir sehen Potential zur Weiterentwicklung der biologischen Landwirtschaft zu einem nachhaltigen, auf Kreislaufwirtschaft basierenden landwirtschaftlichen Produktionssystem f{\"u}r {\"O}sterreich. Um dieses Potential auszusch{\"o}pfen, sollten vom Staat Rahmenbedingungen ge-schaffen werden, um ein transdisziplin{\"a}res Wissenssystem zu etablieren, welches die Innovationskraft sowohl aus der Bauernschaft, der Beratung und der Forschung anerkennt.}

Results/discussion: Present gantry research results show that gantry technology saves energy and work, increases profitability, improves and preserves soil structure, extends working time periods and assures timeliness of critical operations, offers independence frm weather and day light during field work, allows precise fertiliser distribution and irrigation, supports high precision intra-row weed control, field mapping for various objectives, automation of repeating work steps, automated operations by computer vision, and grants better working conditions. 
Gantry technology may in future support organic crop production by
?	continuous mapping of plot specific soil and flora data, 
?	plot mapping for habitat specific operations, 
?	cultivation of perennial vegetation covering, 
?	mixed cropping/alley cropping systems using allelopathic effects for weed and pest resistance, 
?	precise distribution of compost and preparations, 
?	in time sowing, in time weed and pest control, 
?	mulch based cultivating and fertilising.
Gantry technology renders excellent opportunity for transdisciplinary research and co-operation between life scientists and engineers. Scientists from different disciplines are required for measuring and observation of biodiversity indicators, energy balance, soil tilth, nutrient balance, quality of work, and quality of products. Dynamic observation methods like appearance of plants during all stages of development using computer vision and image-processing methods may support human observation. The habitat specific information can be used to plan a crop rotation including mixed cropping or strip cultivation solu-tions, green mulch fertilisation, and allelopathic effects best suited for a given plot or even for a specific location of a given plot.

Einige Verarbeitungsbetriebe nutzen dieses Thema au{\ss}erdem bereits erfolgreich, um ihr Image als Vorreiter  zu st{\"a}rken.
Auch die formulierten Standards zu interner und externer Fairness sowie die Kontrollinstrumente werden derzeit noch erprobt. Insgesamt befindet sich die Ausdifferenzierung des Bio-Markts durch die zunehmende Gr{\"u}ndung von 'Bio-Fair'-Initiativen und der Besch{\"a}ftigung von Verb{\"a}nden mit diesem Thema in einer dynamischen Phase.

        abstract = {Over the last decades, farms have become more specialised. This creates challenges on different levels - for example, nutrient deficiencies in the soil or  financial instability due to market price fluctuations. as the call for more sustainable farming has become louder alternatives have been explored, such as more diversified farming by keeping several livestock species and thereby for example increasing financial stability. keeping several livestock species on one farm may impact the welfare of the animals, which is one dimension of sustainable farming - for example, in terms of animal health or social acceptance of animal products for sale. To gain a more thorough understanding of the benefits, challenges and management practises on organic mixed livestock farms we conducted interviews with 119 farmers in seven European countries. Various topics were broached  to characterise each farm, by asking qualitative and quantitative questions, thereby producing answers to a total of more than 100 items per farm. Our animal welfare data includes housing conditions, pasture management, veterinary treatments and costs, mortality rate, time that farmers spend with their animals and farmers? perception of their animals? welfare. For this contribution, we make a comparison between countries and focus on farms with two combinations of animals, i.e. beef cattle with meat sheep (in France and Sweden) and beef cattle with poultry (in France and Germany). Preliminary descriptive analysis revealed some differences between countries in both combinations for various parameters of animal welfare. However, variation may mostly be explained by climatic differences and farming types (e.g. intensive vs. extensive grazing strategies) and therefore it is not possible to form firm  conclusions regarding the animals? welfare in mixed livestock farms.}

           title = {Strategies to mitigate nitrous oxide emissions from herbivore production systems},
        abstract = {Herbivores are a significant source of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. They account for a large share of manure-related N2O emissions, as well as soil-related N2O emissions through the use of grazing land, and land for feed and forage production. It is widely acknowledged that mitigation measures are necessary to avoid an increase in N2O emissions while meeting the growing global food demand. The production and emissions of N2O are closely linked to the efficiency of nitrogen (N) transfer between the
major components of a livestock system, that is, animal, manure, soil and crop. Therefore, mitigation options in this paper have been structured along these N pathways. Mitigation technologies involving diet-based intervention include lowering the CP content or increasing the condensed tannin content of the diet. Animal-related mitigation options also include breeding for improved N conversion and high animal productivity. The main soil-based mitigation measures include efficient use of fertilizer and manure, including the use of nitrification inhibitors. In pasture-based systems with animal housing facilities, reducing grazing time is an effective option to reduce N2O losses. Crop-based options comprise breeding efforts for increased N-use efficiency and the use of pastures with N2-fixing clover. It is important to recognize that all N2O mitigation options affect the N and carbon cycles of livestock systems. Therefore, care should be taken that reductions in N2O emissions are not offset by unwanted
increases in ammonia, methane or carbon dioxide emissions. Despite the abundant availability of mitigation options,
implementation in practice is still lagging. Actual implementation will only follow after increased awareness among farmers and greenhouse gases targeted policies. So far, reductions in N2O emissions that have been achieved are mostly a positive side effect of other N-targeted policies.},

        abstract = {Der er fra det danske landbrugserhverv formuleret {\o}nske om, at der iv{\ae}rks{\ae}ttes en bedre r{\r a}dgivning omkring gennemf{\o}relse af reduceret jordbearbejdning, herunder direkte s{\r a}ning (FRDK, bl.a. ved m{\o}det i Forskningskontoret 18. januar 2001). Problemstillingen har interesse for s{\r a}vel konventionelle som {\o}kologiske jordbrugere, idet reduceret bearbejdning af jorden som udgangspunkt er positivt for jordkvaliteten. Der er gennemf{\o}rt en lang r{\ae}kke unders{\o}gelser omkring reduceret jordbearbejdning og direkte s{\r a}ning i Danmark. En r{\ae}kke forhold har dog til dels gjort disse resultater for{\ae}ldede. Det skyldes bl.a. den politisk bestemte udvikling i de dyrkede afgr{\o}der, herunder i s{\ae}rlig grad s{\ae}dskiftet, som har stor betydning for reduceret jordbearbejdning. De gennemf{\o}rte fors{\o}g koncentrerede sig endvidere prim{\ae}rt om effekten p{\r a} udbyttet og med mindre fokus p{\r a} milj{\o}m{\ae}ssige aspekter. Samtidig har den maskintekniske udvikling bevirket, at der i dag findes maskiner, der i h{\o}jere grad l{\o}ser nogle af de problemer, der tidligere blev konstateret i forbindelse med reduceret jordbearbejdning.
Reduceret jordbearbejdning ? herunder direkte s{\r a}ning ? har interessante milj{\o}m{\ae}ssige effekter. Det drejer sig dels om et reduceret energiforbrug ved afgr{\o}deetablering. Videre p{\r a}virkes landbrugets indflydelse p{\r a} m{\ae}ngden af drivhusgasser ved reduceret bearbejdning. I forhold til pl{\o}jning vil reduceret bearbejdning {\o}ge lagringen af kulstof i jorden (og dermed fjerne CO2 fra luften). Samtidig er der dog en effekt p{\r a} afgivelsen af luftformige kv{\ae}lstofforbindelser, hvoraf N2O ogs{\r a} er en drivhusgas. De milj{\o}m{\ae}ssige effekter best{\r a}r ogs{\r a} i en reduktion af overfladeafstr{\o}mning og erosion. Til geng{\ae}ld opst{\r a}r tilsyneladende en {\o}get fare for ?by-pass? transport af fosfor og pesticider til dybere jordlag via kontinuerte, vertikale bioporer i jorden ved pl{\o}jefri dyrkning.
Der kan konstateres et f{\ae}lles behov for myndigheder og landbrugserhverv i en kvantificering af muligheder og problemer ved reduceret jordbearbejdning og direkte s{\r a}ning i Danmark. Der er behov for unders{\o}gelser, der gennemf{\o}res i i{\o}vrigt realistiske dyrkningssystemer. S{\r a}danne v{\ae}rkstedsarealer vil give mulighed for belysning af b{\r a}de agronomiske og milj{\o}m{\ae}ssige problemstillinger. Der vil videre i et vist omfang v{\ae}re behov for belysning af mere ad-hoc pr{\ae}gede problemstillinger. S{\r a}danne opgaver b{\o}r dog ogs{\r a} i s{\r a} stor udstr{\ae}kning som muligt gennemf{\o}res i fastliggende fors{\o}g og i realistiske s{\ae}dskifter.

        abstract = {The development of low-input farming systems requires knowledge of the extent to which management characteristics influence the soil as a habitat for micro-organisms and a medium for plant growth. This paper presents a study of long-term effects of organically and conventionally cultivated systems on a range of soil physical, chemical and biological characteristics in Denmark. Seven soils were included, falling into three groups (I?III). Each group consists of an organically managed soil (Org) referenced by one or two conventionally managed soils (Conv) with the same soil type (sandy loam) and pedological history. All organically managed soils were dairy farm soils (H), which had been organically managed for 46, 47 and 40 years, respectively. They had forage crop rotations and received animal manure. The conventional soils were either dairy farm soils or soils grown to annual cash crops (P). Undisturbed core samples were used for assessing dry bulk density and water retention. Undisturbed cubic samples were used for assessing wet stability of macro-aggregates, clay dispersibility, microbial biomass C, -glucosidase activity, ergosterol, and the abundance of different groups of fungi. Penetration resistance and ease of soil fragmentation were measured in the field. The quantifying methods were supplemented by a visual inspection of soil structure of the top 30 cm soil in the field. Irrespective of agricultural system, the use of tractors and heavy machinery had caused compaction of the subsoil in the form of a dense pan below ploughing depth. In group I, the H-soils were heavily trafficked and this overshadowed the long-term effects of the diversified crop rotations and animal manure applications on the physical parameters. Generally, the results highlight the paramount influence of soil tillage and traffic in agriculture. Further, the results confirm the positive effects of organic manures and diversified crop rotations on soil quality aspects. Microbial biomass C was found to be higher in organically than in conventionally managed dairy farm soils, and appeared to correlate linearly to the volume of 0.2?3.0 m pores (`protective' pore space). The simple model did, however, not explain a lower microbial biomass for two soils dressed only with synthetic fertilisers. The results further indicated that the contribution of the different biotic mechanisms responsible for macro-aggregation varied from soil to soil. The results revealed promising correlations between quantitative scientific laboratory methods and descriptive methods in the field.}

Our results support the concept of differentiating soil content of clay in a complexed and non-complexed part although our data did not point out an exact clay/OC ratio threshold. Our results also indicated that labile fractions of SOM may play an important role in soil physical behavior. We revisited literature data and found evidence that soil content of fines ({\ensuremath{<}}2 or {\ensuremath{<}}20 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m) is a major determinant of soil specific surface area (SA). We noted that soil SA coverage with SOM changed dramatically at a specific ratio of either clay ({\ensuremath{<}}2 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m) or clay+silt ({\ensuremath{<}}20 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m) with soil OC. This is an indirect support of the recently suggested quantification of the soil mineral ?saturation? hypothesis. More studies are needed on the causal relationships. We conclude that clay/OC{\texttt{\char126}}10 or (clay+silt20{\ensuremath{\mu}}m)/OC{\texttt{\char126}}20 are corresponding indices reflecting shift in soil physical behavior.},

In this paper we show that clay particles (colloids) in soils that are low in OM content are easily dispersed in the soil water, which in turn has important effects on soil ecosystem functions and services. Organic farming systems generally tend to increase soil OM contents and may thus mitigate the negative effects.}

The document has been developed through a dynamic consultative process that ran from 2008 to 2009.
It involved a wide range of stakeholders who enthusiastically joined the effort to define organic research priorities.
 
From December 2008 to February; the expert groups elaborated the first draft. The consultative process involved the active participation of many different countries. Consultation involved researchers, advisors, members of inspection/certification bodies, as well as different users/beneficiaries of the research such as farmers, processors, market actors and members of civil society organisations throughout Europe and further afield in order to gather the research needs of the whole organic sector.},

        abstract = {In many countries there is a trend in milk production to either maximize the milk yield with high inputs and modern milking technology or to choose a low external input strategy with emphasis on grazing. What about the sustainability and resilience of such types of farms? In this paper a comparison of two modern milk farms in the same region and village in Switzerland with similar climatic conditions and new free-range stables has been made. Both farms are run collectively. Farm A is a non-organic milk farm (integrated production) with milk robot machinery and high input of feed concentrates for milk production without using pasture but with a concrete outdoor run. Farm B is an organic milk farm with consequent low input milk production with full pasture access during the season, outdoor run in the winter as well as a non-use of cereal-based concentrates anymore due to consequent breeding efforts. Both farms have been assessed using the RISE 2.0 system developed by the School of Agricultural, Forest and Food Sciences (HAFL) in Zollikofen in collaboration with the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL), Switzerland. This system uses 10 main sustainability criteria, categories and indicates through benchmarking the state of the farm in different areas (positive, to be verified, problematic). 
The overall sustainability assessment showed that none of the two farms is in a problematic area. Both are economically successful. Both strategies, if well managed, can be profitable. The farms score socially well due to the collective management. Regarding environmental sustainability: soil usage and water management is positive; nutrient flow and ammoniac emissions could still be improved in both farms. Farm B uses 40 \% less energy with 30 \% lower milk production/animal/year and score better in biodiversity than farm A. Animal health and welfare of the two farms is difficult to judge with RISE 2.0 system, but it is interesting to look from a resilience perspective. Farm A has a technology-based system of analytical and electronic tools (health status permanently controlled and irregularities reported). Direct observations by the farmers in the stable seem less important, although also done. The strategy of Farm B is based on a much lower feeding and milk productivity level, which reduces the risk of several diseases. The farmers observe mainly their animals on pasture or in the outdoor run and milking station. However their consequent grazing system, with varying climatic impact on the fodder quality needs a very well planned pasture system. It is interesting that both farms have relatively low costs for veterinarians. Further reflections are needed in which way the sustainability and resilience of such type of milk farms can be better assessed and improved.

The case studies were selected in five countries for their agro-ecological and socio-economic diversity. The methodology developed was based on the Participatory Impact Pathway Analysis(PIPA) and complemented by some additional methods, mainly to adapt the PIPA approach to the requirements of an ex-post impact assessment (using Outcome Harvesting). We also put more emphasis on the role of the actor network, considering its great importance in the agricultural sector. All cases showed that the intended impacts as defined at the beginning of the research programme are at least partially met at the time of the assessment, and that both unintended and unexpected effects occurred. Enabling and disabling factors were identified regarding the development of trust, networks and role of economic and institutional frameworks. We provide recommendations aimed at the research and research policy community on ex-ante, within-project, and ex-post research impact assessment, as well as on management of research calls and of funding frameworks.},

The research is based on the general finding that trust is one of the most crucial aspects when consumer decide whether to buy or not to buy organic products. However, there are hardly any empirical works which analyse in detail consumer trust in organic food and the ways it can be enhanced. First, based on a quantitative inquiry of 600 persons in Germany the study presented investigates consumer trust in the different actors involved in the organic supply chain (farmers, processors, traders, labels), in distinct attributed qualities such as benefits for health, ecology and animal welfare as well as the customers? criteria for assessing trustworthiness of the organic products. Empirical data is analysed by multivariate statistics such as cluster analysis to identify distinct consumer segments with respect to their trust characteristics. In a second step there will be a qualitative research method using interviews combined with a visualizing technique. The aim of this method is to understand the consumers? attitudes towards the supply chain of organic food and the complex construct of trust better. The results shall help to develop communication strategies for enhancing consumer trust in organic food. }

The present study under FAO-CFC-TBI project was done at Maud Tea Estate, Assam, India to find out an effective pathway for growing healthy and productive young tea plants. Seven different organic packages of practice were chosen to evaluate their potential in terms of crop efficiency as well as soil quality rejuvenation. Crop yield was recorded of highest value under Inhana Rational Farming (IRF-2: made tea 807 kgha-1) package of practice. Yield under the treatment was 55.2 percent higher than control and about 25.6 percent higher than the next best performing package of practice i.e. VMI (653 kgha-1). The third highest yield was obtained under IRF-1 and VCO, which recorded almost similar crop (made tea: 619 \& 618 kgha-1 resp.) followed by BD (593 kgha-1), Co (567 kgha-1) and MI (556 kgha-1) packages. Value cost ratio (VCR), which is excess revenue generated per unit rupee invested; followed similar trend as observed in case of New Plantation experiment indicating highest economic sustainability under IRF-2 (4.37) followed by IRF-1 (2.33) package. Value cost ratio in case of other organic packages varied between 0.25 and 1.02, indicating economic vulnerability considering that VCR {\ensuremath{<}} 2.00 has been indicated by Agricultural economists as the critical mark below which there is no necessary risk coverage against investment towards input cost.},

Weiterhin wurde der Prozess analysiert, in dem Akteure der Land? und Lebensmittelwirtschaft gemeinschaftliche Wertsch{\"o}pfung aufbauen. Dazu begleiteten die Projektpartner diesen Prozess im Rahmen eines Aktionsforschungsansatzes in zwei Fallgruppen praktisch und reflektierten ihn wissenschaftlich. Mit dem Ziel, ein entsprechendes berufliches Anforderungsprofil zu ermitteln, wurden Personen, die den Aufbau gemeinschaftlicher Wertsch{\"o}pfung
professionell begleiten, zu ihren T{\"a}tigkeiten und Kompetenzen befragt.

Biodynamic farming aims to achieve resilience and regeneration, therefore has the potential to address the problems facing the UK food and farming systems. The UK has the second highest level of food insecurity within Europe (WHO, 2018). As a result of Covid-19, it is estimated that there was a quadrupling in levels of food insecurity as a result of panic buying and economic impacts (Loopstra, 2020). Biodynamic farmers can form partnerships with local communities who are at higher risk from food insecurity in the form of community supported agriculture to allow individuals to benefit from the production, rewards and responsibilities associated with the production of food (Biodynamic Association UK (BA), n.d.) and try to reduce the current disparities within the UK food system. With food insecurity comes dietary related illnesses (Lang et al., 2018). Biodynamic farmed produce have been proven to provide a range of health benefits including a reduction in allergic reactions (BA ,n.d.) and the supply of greater quantities of nutrients including vitamin C (Crinnion, 2020), iron and magnesium (Larion, 2009). By improving the health of individuals, wider benefits may be seen when looking at the strain currently experienced by the health services. Biodynamic farming techniques can enhance the fertility of soil (Fliessbach et al., 2000), therefore by implementing such techniques, the UK can continue to produce food for an extended period of time, increasing its resilience. Biodynamic farming focusses on each farm being self-sustaining, consequently, adopting these methods can reduce the reliance on imports of food from different countries, which has the potential to be affected by Brexit and border challenges (Lang et al., 2018). The UK has a 20-year vision on antimicrobial resilience which can be achieved using biodynamic farming due to their view of using antibiotics only in cases of preventing suffering of livestock (BA, n.d.). Furthermore, this enhances the health of the animals which can ensure their efficacy for future generations, thus providing a steady supply of food. Biodynamic farming techniques can be adopted as a response to the many challenges currently facing the UK food and farming systems whilst providing wider economic and environmental benefits.}

All samples were infected with root rot Fusarium spp., mostly F. avenaceum. Plant parasitic nematodes were found in soil from all samples. Eight nematode groups were present. Spiral nematodes were the most common and abundant group; present on all the farms. No strong correlations were found between numbers of nematodes in the soil and the degree of Fusarium root rot or percentage of clover.

Both a literature research on the topic and contact with relevant research and advisory institutions in Europe, show that there is a need to investigate the topic further. There is a lack of relevant analyses of animal manure. Methods for analysing need to be developed; and more research is needed on the uptake of harmful elements in plants.
We recommend that a Nordic seminar is held to discuss and coordinate future research on the topic. We also suggest that The NFSA take an active part in the process due to probable changes in current regulations.},

        abstract = {This is the final report of the Defra project OF0164.
Organic farming aims to create an economically and environmentally sustainable agriculture, with the emphasis placed on self-sustaining biological systems rather than external inputs. Building soil fertility is central to this ethos. ?Soil fertility? can be considered as a measure of the soil?s ability to sustain satisfactory crop growth, both in the short- and longer-term. It is determined by a set of interactions between the soil?s physical environment, chemical environment and biological activity. The aim of this project was, therefore, to provide a better scientific understanding of soil fertility under organic farming.
The approach was to undertake a comprehensive literature review at the start of the project to assess and synthesise available information. Studies were then designed to address specific questions identified from the literature review.  
The literature review was written during the first year of the project.  In addition to submitting written copies to DEFRA, the chapters were posted on a project website: www.adas.co.uk/soilfertility.  
The Review was based around key questions:
?	What are the soil organic matter characteristics and the roles of different fractions of the soil organic matter?
?	Do organically managed soils have higher levels of organic matter (SOM), with a resultant improvement in soil properties?
?	Is the soil biology different in organically managed soils, in terms of size, biodiversity and activity?
?	Do organically managed soils have a greater inherent capacity to supply plant nutrients?
?	What are the nutrient pools and their sizes?
?	What are the processes and rates of nutrient transfer in relation to nutrient demand?
?	What are the environmental consequences of organic management?
The project also included a large amount of practical work. This necessarily covered a wide range of topics, which were examined in a series of separate studies:
?	Soil microbiology: a series of measurements focusing on two sites, undertaken by University of Wales Bangor (UWB)
?	Field campaigns in autumn 1999 and spring/summer 2000: separate field sampling campaigns focusing especially on nutrient pools, undertaken by HDRA, ADAS and IGER
?	Incubation studies: a series of three separate experiments to look in more detail at N dynamics, managed by ADAS, with support from IGER and HDRA
From the literature review and the practical work, the following was concluded:
Organic matter is linked intrinsically to soil fertility, because it is important in maintaining good soil physical conditions (e.g. soil structure, aeration and water holding capacity), which contribute to soil fertility.  Organic matter also contains most of the soil reserve of N and large proportions of other nutrients such as P and sulphur.
Field management data gathered from farmers showed, however, that organic matter returns are not necessarily larger in organic systems.  Many non-organically farmed soils receive regular manure applications and the generally higher yielding crops on conventional farms may return larger crop residues.  Conversely, many organic fields receive little or no manure, relying on the fertility building ley phase for organic matter input.  This observation is important.  Management practices within organic and non-organic systems are diverse, and all have consequences for soil fertility.
The Executive Summary at the start of the main attached report has additional sections on Soil Structure,  Soil Biology, and Nutrient Cycling with some greater detail on comparisons of organic and conventional management and the consequences for soil fertility.}

These overcapacities of organic biogas plants may represent maladjustment to external preconditions as a result of bad planning as well as carefully considered exploitations of business opportunities on the basis of external inputs. In order to reduce non-organic substrate use due to bad planning, on one hand biogas consulting services which account for the particular conditions of organic agriculture should be enhanced, on the other hand farmers need to seek independent advice before concluding an agreement with an engineering company.},

Orchards are perennial cultures, and, especially in organic fruit production, it is essential to design and manage orchards in a way which favours predators and parasitoids over pests. Increasing plant biodiversity and habitats in such a way that beneficial organisms are favoured is called Functional Agrobiodiversity (FAB). The value of FAB for reducing pesticide use in fruit production is generally acknowledged, and many organic fruit growers try to increase it in spite of a shortage of information on FAB, economical and technical challenges and lack of situation-specific, detailed advice. To improve this situation, ECOORCHARD combined several complementary approaches and prioritizes making information and tools about FAB available to practitioners.},

The objective of this research was to verify the effect of the association of garlic with fodder radish on richness, abundance and diversity of arthropods under organic production system in Lavras, MG, Brazil. The treatments were composed of garlic in monoculture and garlic in association with fodder radish, in plots of 40 garlic plants, intercropped or not with two lines of fodder radish. Weekly, 25 samples were collected for a period of 10 weeks (n=250). Species accumulation curves, species richness, abundance, and diversity index were determined, and T or Mann-Whitney tests were used for analysis. The 250 samples collected were sufficient to register the majority of species present in garlic. Richness and abundance were higher in diversified garlic whereas diversity was higher in monoculture. Diversified system increased the overall richness of phytophagous species and parasitoids. The abundance of T. tabaci decreased, while increased the presence of A. fabae, demonstrating that the association was potentially beneficent to the culture. The possible reasons for these results are discussed, and future works should focus in the ecological mechanisms involved in crop diversification of organic garlic.}

        abstract = {O objetivo do presente trabalho foi estudar a influencia da adubacao verde e/ou organica e do fornecimento hidrico sobre o desenvolvimento e produtividade de taro manejado organicamente, alem de avaliar a influencia do manejo e cobertura vegetal sobre indicadores de qualidade do solo (IQS), identificando quais os IQS sao sensiveis a mudanca de manejo na regiao de Paty do Alferes-RJ. Foram realizados, durante tres anos consecutivos em mesma area sob Latossolo Amarelo, cultivos de taro (Colocasia esculenta), em esquemas fatoriais distribuidos em blocos ao acaso, sob sistema organico de producao. Em 2004 o taro foi plantado em monocultivo ou consorciado com Crotalaria juncea, adubado em cobertura com 0 cu 4,5 Mg ha' 1 de composto organico. No ano de 2005 o taro foi plantado em monocultivo ou consorciado com C. juncea, irrigado a cada 3,5 dias por 30 minutos e a cada 14 dias por 2 horas. Em 2006 o taro foi plantado em monocultivo ou consorciado com Canavalia emformes (feijao-de-porco), irrigado a cada 3,5 dias por 30 minutos e a cada 14 dias por 2 horas, e adubado em cobertura com 0 e 3 Mg ha' 1 com torta de mamona. Foram realizadas coletas de solo da area experimental de taro (CO) e de areas de Mata Atlantica (M), pastagem degradada (AD) e tomate e pimentao em cultivo convencional (CC), pertencentes a mesma bacia hidrografica. No cultivo de 2004 o consorcio afetou negativamente a produtividade e numero totais e das classes 1 e 2 de rizomas laterais e o numero medio de rizomas laterais. A produtividade de rizomas laterais da classe 3 foi beneficiada pelo consorcio, em oposicao ao numero. Em 2005, para os rizomas laterais, o turno de rega curto aumentou o numero e a produtividade totais e da classe 3, peso e numero medio, enquanto para os rizomas centrais sonente o peso medio. O consorcio com C. juncea afetou negativamente o numero e produtividade da classe 1 e totais, numero medio de rizomas laterais e peso medio de rizomas cer.trais, mas nao a produtividade total de rizomas laterais. No cultivo de 2006 o consorcio com feijao-de-porco reduziu o numero e produtividade de rizomas da classe 3, peso m{\'e}dio dos rizomas laterais e centrais; mas em interacao com adubacao em cobertura com 3,0 Mg ha' 1 de torta de mamona elevou o numero e produtividade totais e da classe 1. Em 2004 a analise de componentes principais (ACP) foi capaz de separar as areas estudadas, sendo que as ADs apresentaram elevados valores de qC02 e baixos para qMicro-C, em contraposicao com a M, que apresentava maiores valores para NL, CL, CT e NT. Foi observada grande similaridade entre o CO e o CC, sendo que ambos possuiam, para a maioria das variaveis, valores medios. O comportamento apresentado em 2005 foi similar ao ocorrido em 2004, com CO apresentando valores medios para todas as variaveis nas tres coletas realizadas. A M foi responsavel pelos valores mais altos de CT, CL, NT, NL, BMS-C, BMS-N e RBS. No ano de 2006, o CC e CO possuiam valores medios para todas as variaveis. Contudo, CC possu{\'i}a valores acima da media para CT, CL, NL, NT e BMS-C. Durante os tres anos experimentais as variaveis BMS, RBS, qMicro e qC02 foram as mais sensiveis a mudancas do ambiente, seguidos por CL, NL, CT e NT que estao mais sujeitas a atividade microbiana, e por ultimo fiocram as variaveis estritamente quimicas, como Ca, Mg, P, K, Al e pH. Conclui-se que a actbacao em cobertura, o sistema de cultivo e o turno de rega afetam o desenvolvimento e a produtividade, caracteristicas quimicas e biologicas do solo em cultivo de taro. A ACP dislinguiu as areas sob diferentes manejos, nao sendo possivel identificar um IQS que fosse absoluto.

A primeira etapa de selecao baseou-se em testes in vivo com 224 isolados obtidos a partir de folhas sadias de maracujazeiro amarelo coletadas em pomares comerciais, sendo 102 oriundos do estado de Roraima, 72 do Para e 50 de Sao Paulo. Estes foram testados em casa-de-vegetacao no controle das bacterias fitopatogenicas originadas dos estados de Roraima (Xap-RR), Sao Paulo (Xap-SP) e Para (Xap-PA). Apos esta etapa, foram selecionados os residentes de filoplano RR-46; RR-29; RR-133; RR-98 e RR-14, oriundo de Roraima e SP-11; SP-18; SP-22; SP-48 e SP-28, provenientes de Sao Paulo devido apresentarem baixos niveis de severidade da doenca 2,3; 2,8;2,9; 3,5;  3,6; 3,2; 3,25; 3,55; 4,25 e 6,25\%, respectivamente. Nao houve nenhum antagonista detectado como promissor proveniente do estado do Para. Foram selecionados os isolados RR-14; RR-29; RR-46; RR-98; RR-133; SP-11; SP 18; SP-22; SP-28 e SP-48, para a segunda etapa de selecao. Esta realizada, in itro onde os isolados foram submetidos aos ensaios para verificacao da utilizacao de fontes unicas de carbono para verificacao de sobreposicao de nicho, antibiose por difus{\~a}o em meio de cultura, producao de sideroforos e influencia na atividade da enzima peroxidase na planta. Os resultados demonstraram que os isolados RR-98 e RR-113 foram capazes de competir por nicho somente contra Xap-RR, atraves da sobreposicao de nicho. Na antibiose, por difusao em meio de cultura o isolado RR- 29, foi capaz de inibir tres isolados de Xap, provenientes de RR, SP, PA e o isolado SP-28 inibiu apenas as duas ultimas. A producao de sideroforos foi observada somente pelos isolados RR-29 e SP-28. Nenhum antagonista foi capaz de influenciar no aumento da atividade de peroxidases nas plantas de maracujazeiro o que indica que nao sao capazes de induzirem resistencia. A sobreposicao de nicho, competicao por ferro e/ou antibiose sao fatores que explicam a capacidade de controle da mancha-bacteriana, mediadas pelos isolados RR-98 e RR-133, RR-29 e SP-28.

The study applied the N dilution model for plant tissue which comparatively uses modifiable factors of the environment at optimal levels. The model shows decline in N concentration due to the DM accumulation of temperate grass pastures. Data were compared to model by the root mean square deviation analysis. Dilution coefficient ({\ensuremath{\beta}}), used in all pasture samples, was lower than -0.60. Highest N concentration decline in plant tissues, due to DM accumulation, occurred in RY + WC pastures ({\ensuremath{\beta}} = -0.94), followed by RY + FP ({\ensuremath{\beta}} = - 0.86) and RY + BO ({\ensuremath{\beta}} = - 0.67), respectively.

        abstract = {To promote food security and sustainability, ecologically intensive farming systems should reliably produce adequate yields of high-quality food, enhance the environment, be profitable, and promote social wellbeing. Yet, while many studies address the mean effects of ecologically intensive farming systems on sustainability metrics, few have considered variability. This represents a knowledge gap because producers depend on reliable provisioning of yields, profits, and environmental services to enhance the sustainability of their production systems over time. Further, stable crop yields are necessary to ensure reliable access to nutritious foods. Here we address this by conducting a global meta-analysis to assess the average magnitude and variability of seven sustainability metrics in organic compared to conventional systems. Specifically, we explored the effects of these systems on (i) biotic abundance, (ii) biotic richness, (iii) soil organic carbon, (iv) soil carbon stocks, (v) crop yield, (vi) total production costs, and (vii) profitability. Organic farms promoted biotic abundance, biotic richness, soil carbon, and profitability, but conventional farms produced higher yields. Compared to conventional farms, organic farms had lower variability in abundance and richness but greater yield variability. Organic farms thus provided a ?win-win? (high means and low variability) for environmental sustainability, while conventional farms provided a ?win-win? for production by promoting high crop yields with low variability. Despite lower yields, and greater yield variability, organic systems had similar costs to conventional systems and were more profitable due to organic premiums. Our results suggest certification guidelines for organic farms successfully promote reliable environmental benefits, but greater reliance on ecological processes may reduce predictability of crop production.}

        abstract = {Agroforestry is a land-use system that integrates trees and shrubs with crops and/or livestock production. It has been identified by the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD, 2008) as a ?win-win? approach that balances the production of commodities (food, feed, fuel, fibre, etc.) with non-commodity outputs such as environmental protection and cultural and landscape amenities. This paper will review the potential of agroforestry as part of a multifunctional working landscape in temperate regions, and will consider management and policy implications of widespread adoption of this form of land-use. },

? Dokumenterbare effekter for b{\ae}rekraftig utvikling
? Omr{\r a}der hvor {\o}kologisk landbruk har et utviklingspotensial som spydspiss
Rapporten belyser driftsformens rolle som l{\ae}ringsarena, korrektiv og spydspiss i arbeidet for {\r a} gj{\o}re norsk landbruk mer milj{\o}vennlig og b{\ae}rekraftig.
Ulike tolkinger av b{\ae}rekraft-begrepet er referert. Det er gjort rede for bakgrunn, verdigrunnlag, definisjon og prinsipper for {\o}kologisk landbruk.
{\O}kologisk og konvensjonelt landbruk, som to ulike driftskonsept, har mye {\r a} l{\ae}re av hverandre. Grunnleggende biologisk kunnskap er viktig for begge driftsm{\r a}tene. {\O}kologisk landbruk er kunnskapsintensivt og forutsetter at hver enkelt gardbruker har god innsikt i agronomi og greier {\r a} tilpasse drifta til egne, lokale forhold. Derfor er gardbrukernes involvering i FoU-arbeid vesentlig for utvikling av driftsforma. Gardsstudier som FoU-metode ble introdusert i {\o}kologisk landbruk, og n{\r a} ogs{\r a} tatt i bruk innen konvensjonelt landbruk. Dyrkingssystemfors{\o}k og n{\ae}ringsbalanseberegninger er andre FoU-metoder som f{\o}rst er tatt i bruk i studier av {\o}kologisk landbruk.
Praksis i {\o}kologisk landbruk har p{\r a}virket det konvensjonelle p{\r a} ulike m{\r a}ter. Gjeninnf{\o}ring av god agronomi gjennom sk{\r a}nsom behandling av jord, resirkulering av organiske ressurser, vekstskifte og bruk av belgvekster, f{\r a}r {\o}kende oppmerksomhet ogs{\r a} innen konvensjonelt landbruk. For {\r a} lykkes med ugraskontroll og kontroll av skadegj{\o}rere er biologikunnskap grunnleggende b{\r a}de i integrert og {\o}kologisk landbruk. Termiske og mekaniske teknikker i plantevernet, som er utviklet fordi det der ikke er tillatt med kjemiske plantevernmidler, er n{\r a} p{\r a} vei inn i det konvensjonelle landbruket.
Holdning til husdyr har v{\ae}rt viktig for de kravene som stilles i det {\o}kologiske regelverket for at husdyr skal kunne ha mest mulig naturlig adferd. Dyrs egenverdi, krav til inneareal, uteareal, dagslys og tilpassinger basert p{\r a} artsspesifikke behov er i stadig st{\o}rre grad implementert i regelverket som gjelder for alt husdyrhold. Her har {\o}kologisk landbruk g{\r a}tt foran og v{\ae}rt p{\r a}drivere for en utvikling som ogs{\r a} er st{\o}ttet opp om fra milj{\o}- og dyrevernorganisasjoner.
Produksjonspress og krav om intensivering av landbruket gjennom politiske virkemidler, er en trussel for b{\ae}rekraften b{\r a}de i det {\o}kologiske og konvensjonelle landbruket. {\O}kte andeler innkj{\o}pt kraftf{\^o}r i melkeproduksjonen er eksempel p{\r a} en utvikling som gir d{\r a}rligere n{\ae}ringsstoffregnskap og fare for mindre effektiv ressursbruk.
Rapporten viser til de mest sentrale studier av ulike milj{\o}parametere der {\o}kologisk og konvensjonell produksjon er sammenlignet. De viktigste parameterne er biologisk mangfold, jordfruktbarhet, n{\ae}ringsstoffenes kretsl{\o}p, nitrogeneffektivitet, forurensing og energiforbruk.
Under v{\r a}re forhold har {\o}kologisk landbruk ofte noe lavere avkastning og krever derfor mer arealer for {\r a} produsere samme mengde. Ved sammenligninger kommer likevel {\o}kologisk ofte positivt for indikatorer som energibruk og nitrogeneffektivitet n{\r a}r en regner per arealenhet, mens konvensjonelt ofte kommer bedre ut om en regner per produsert enhet.
Studier som har analysert innhold av {\o}nskede og u{\o}nskede stoffer i {\o}kologisk og konvensjonell mat er ogs{\r a} referert, samt unders{\o}kelser over mulige sammenhenger mellom kostholdsvaner og kj{\o}p av {\o}kologisk versus konvensjonelt produserte matvarer.
Internasjonalt er agro{\o}kologiske metoder ansett av FN-systemet {\r a} ha stor betydning for sikker og variert matproduksjon og matforsyning, spesielt i fattige land. Metodene er lite kapitalintensive og kan gi grunnlag for robust og sosial rettferdig produksjon.
Det er stor innovasjonskraft i det {\o}kologiske landbruket n{\r a}r det gjelder nye omsetningsformer. En grunn til dette kan v{\ae}re behovet for {\r a} kommunisere om produksjonsm{\r a}ten direkte med forbrukerne, og utvikle mer lokale og oversiktlige verdikjeder for mat. Andelslandbruk, gardsutsalg, abonnementsordninger, nettsalg og Bondens marked skaper, i tillegg til selve matsalget, slike l{\ae}ringsarenaer hvor det er mulig {\r a} kommunisere om produksjonsm{\r a}te. Disse arenaene bidrar i tillegg {\r a} differensiere matvaremarkedet og {\o}ke betalingsvilje for h{\o}ykvalitetsprodukter.
B{\r a}de i Norge og andre land er det vist at det offentlige kan f{\r a} i gang viktige endringsprosesser med utgangspunkt i {\o}kologisk mat. Eksempler er kvalitetsl{\o}ft i offentlig matservering og forvaltning i s{\r a}rbare omr{\r a}der. {\O}kologisk landbruk og mat kan fungere som en felles politisk visjon og som middel til utvikling, innovasjon og forandring. Dette er omr{\r a}der med stort uutnyttet potensial.

        abstract = {Mobile phones are widespread in the rural areas of Mali and Burkina Faso, but their potential as a tool for knowledge transfer by extension services in the region remains largely unexplored. The aim of this contribution is to evaluate the potential of video on mobile phones as a tool for farmer-to-farmer exchange and agricultural extension in Western Africa's rural reality. This aim was addressed by interviewing 460 farmers in Mali and Burkina Faso. Third generation (3G) mobile phones with video and Bluetooth technology were found to be widespread in the study area. Furthermore, videos on 3G phones were found to have a high frequency of contact and a high information utility. The participating farmers reported that 3G phones are readily accessible: including to people who had previously had limited access to information sources, such as young women. Video based information is particularly advantageous to illiterate farmers, and has potential to transform the typically top-down nature of information flow from extension agents to farmers. The farmers, in this case, hold ownership of video based information, which thereby extends its outreach. These findings allow the conclusions that video on mobile phones has tremendous potential as a tool for agricultural extension and farmer-to-farmer exchange in developing countries. The use of video on mobile phones is a novel approach to farmer-to-farmer exchange, which could contribute to transforming and amplifying extension efforts and thereby enabling the necessary intensification of land use, while also enabling more resilient, inclusive and democratic farming systems.},

        abstract = {CONTEXT
Agricultural science has mainly focused on specialized farming systems, so understanding the management of more diversified systems remains a challenge. Several analytical frameworks have been proposed to assess on-farm integration, i.e., the management of spatial and temporal interactions among farm enterprises (crops, pastures, and animals). However, they rely on a vision centered on farming practices, whereas farmers? decisions regarding this integration largely depend on the available workforce, worker skills, range of products, and distribution channels.
OBJECTIVE
Here, we propose a new analytical framework to assess farm integration according to farming practices, work organization, and sales management and apply this framework to a case study.
METHODS
We iteratively conducted a review of the literature and brainstorming among experts to develop a set of indicators for assessing integration on these three dimensions. The integration of farming practices is assessed through interactions between crops, pastures, livestock, and on-farm processing enterprises. Integration of work organization is assessed through the versatility of workers and the temporal distribution of farming activities. The integration of sales management is assessed based on the use of short distribution channels, customer behavior, the range of products, and the temporality of sales from the different farm enterprises. We applied this analytical framework to a case study with ten organic and multispecies livestock farms and performed a hierarchical clustering analysis to compare different ways of assessing farm integration.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Our analytical framework includes 54 integration indicators, including 23 related to farming practices, 16 to work organization, and 15 to sales management. The application of this framework to ten organic livestock farms highlights consistency among hierarchical clustering based on work organization and sales management indicators. For instance, selling farm products on short distribution channels to customers buying several farm products and spreading sales over the year were related to an increased overlap of activities due to the processing and on-farm sales that add to agricultural activities. Conversely, the level of farming practice interactions was variable within each cluster. This demonstrates the need to extend the assessment of integration beyond farming practices to provide a holistic description of on-farm integration.
SIGNIFICANCE
This framework provides a tool to better understand how diversified agricultural systems operate and how farm enterprises are managed in time and space. It will improve our understanding of how farm integration can enhance farm performance and reveal the most promising management options for diversified agricultural systems.},

        abstract = {Use of high energy feed supplementation can improve the protein retention by the cattle, and it has been suggested as a way to increase the nitrogen (N) effi-ciency of dairy production. However, in praxis feed supplementation is also used to increase the intensity of animal production above the level that can be supported by the farm's local plant production.  A collection of published surveys showed that dairy farms that buy feed are considerably lees N efficient than farms that supply the entire animal ration from their own plant production. The total N emission to the environment per litre milk doubled when 30\% of the total feed ration was produced outside the dairy farm. This was so for organic as well as conventional farms. Similar results can be expected for phosphorous and other nutrients. In order to ensure a sustainable and environmentally friendly organic production, imports of feed produced far away from the dairy farm should be strictly limited. We suggest a ceiling of 5 - 10\% of total feed ration.}

        abstract = {Inputs of N and P, flows through the soil?plant?animal pathway and removals by products were recorded for 3 years at the organically managed prototype dairy farm ?Frydenhaug? in Norway to assess the transfer efficiencies of N and P within and at the farm level. Nutrient balances and efficiency (N or P in products divided by N or P in inputs) were compared to data from other studies of dairy farm systems in Europe. Plant production on the farm covered nearly all the needs by the herd. However, about 10\% of the plant production was sold as cash crop and about the same amount was bought as feed. At the farm level, ?Frydenhaug? realized annually and on average lower surpluses and higher N or P efficiencies than found in most studies concerned. On average, N and P surpluses were 41 and 0.6 kg ha?1 per year, the efficiencies were 0.30 and 0.85, and the surplus per animal produce was 2.4 and 0.2 kg kg?1, respectively. Despite relative high nutrient efficiencies at the farm level, there were considerable losses within the farm system. Nutrients were lost during harvesting, storage and feeding of home-grown crops. Thus, the intake of N and P by the herd was on average 62 and 59\% of the harvestable N and P in field crops. The average apparent efficiency in the soil/plant component was 0.89 for N and 1.66 for P, and in the animal component 0.19 for N and 0.18 for P. The negative soil surface P balance (on average, 6.3 kg ha?1 per year) was not regarded as a problem on short-term, but it may limit the productivity of the system on the long-term. Improved forage quality through more frequent cuttings and a moderate concentrate level increased milk production and improved the N efficiency at the farm level without a negative effect on the N utilization in the animal component. This study illustrates the importance of including the internal nutrient flow in order to assess and improve the nutrient utilization in organic dairy farming.

        abstract = {Within the European-funded research project CORE Organic Farmer Consumer Partnership, we tested selected OrganicPlus arguments displayed on organic egg packages in consumer choice experiments in the five study countries of Austria, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The focus was on investigating consumers? preferences and willingness to pay for the selected OrganicPlus arguments: ?from the respective country?, ?from the respective region?, ?highest animal welfare standards? and ?fair prices for our organic farmers: 20cents extra?. Furthermore, the objective was to determine causal relationships between the preferences observed and the relevant characteristics of the consumers by means of a questionnaire-based survey. The data was analysed with multinomial logit models.
As hypothesised, organic egg packages displaying OrganicPlus arguments were more preferred by organic consumers than organic eggs without OrganicPlus arguments. However, consumer preferences varied between the arguments and between countries. The argument, ?from the respective region? was the most preferred argument in all countries, except in Austria, where it was ranked after ?highest animal welfare standards? and ?from the respective country?. The argument ?highest animal welfare standards? was the most preferred argument in Austria, while it was ranked after the argument ?from the respective region? in Germany and Switzerland. The argument ?fair prices for our organic farmers: 20 pence/20 cents/50 Rappen extra? was significantly preferred among German and Swiss consumers, although the argument was less relevant than ?from the respective region? and ?highest animal welfare standards?. 
The willingness to pay for OrganicPlus arguments varied considerably between the countries, however, it was highest for ?from the respective region? in most study countries. Causal relationships were found between consumers? attitudes and their preferences for some of the OrganicPlus arguments. Besides this, socio-demographic characteristics, purchase patterns related to organic food as well as consumers? social commitment all had an impact on consumers? preferences for OrganicPlus arguments. },

Total costs, entrepreneurial profit and return on labour were chosen as key data for rentability. Job satisfaction, wealth in time and health were selected to describe the quality of life. The results confirm that bigger farms with more dairy cows operate more cost efficiently, but the farm with the most dairy cows was not the most successful economically. It was not possible to determine if larger, more economically successful farms also enjoy a higher quality of life due to the small sample size. However, correlations were found between the key data for rentability and wealth in time which warrant further study in future projects.},

             url = {https://orgprints.org/id/eprint/5401/},
        abstract = {Der er gennemf{\o}rt en beregning af udvaskning af nitrat, ammonium, DOC og DON for en konventionel og en {\o}kologisk situation i et indsatsomr{\r a}de ved ?S{\o}nders{\o}? p{\r a} Fyn. Beregningerne er udf{\o}rt med DAISY-modellen, indeholdende et nyudviklet DOC/DON-modul og MIKE SHE-modellen. 

Modelops{\ae}tningen, der d{\ae}kker et noget st{\o}rre omr{\r a}de end selve indsatsomr{\r a}det,  baserer sig p{\r a} den eksisterende arealanvendelse og landbrugssituation for en del af omr{\r a}det, og ekstrapoleret i den nordvestlige del. Ekstrapolationen d{\ae}kker kun en lille del af det faktiske indsatsomr{\r a}de. Modelops{\ae}tningerne bygger p{\r a} tidligere modelleringsstudier i samme omr{\r a}de.

Koncentrationerne af DOC og DON er stort set ens i de to scenarier p{\r a} grund af, at den styrende faktor er jordens organiske pulje. P{\r a} grund af st{\o}rre forekomst af gr{\ae}smarker i {\o}kologisk landbrug ville man forvente en opbygning af den organiske pulje, men DAISY-modellen synes at undervurdere denne faktor. Forskellen i DOC/DON-produktion mellem konventionelt og {\o}kologisk jordbrug forventes derfor ogs{\r a} at v{\ae}re undervurderet. For at beskrive DOC/DON-dynamikken i grundvandet, er den udvaskede m{\ae}ngde opdelt i forskellige puljer, med forskellige C/N-forhold og nedbrydningstid.

M{\ae}ngden af uorganisk nitrat udvasket fra rodzonen er v{\ae}sentligt lavere i indsatsomr{\r a}det efter oml{\ae}gning til {\o}kologisk brug, nemlig 29 kg N/ha i forhold til 70 kg N/ha i gennemsnit f{\o}r oml{\ae}gningen. 

Effekten af oml{\ae}gningen er noget forsinket. Nitratkoncentrationen til dr{\ae}n falder fra 13.2 kg nitrat-N/ha (2003-2012) i det konventionelle scenarie til 9.5 kg nitrat-N/ha i det {\o}kologiske scenarie, opgjort som gennemsnit for de f{\o}rste 10 {\r a}r af oml{\ae}gningen (samme klimaserie og periode). For koncentrationerne i det {\o}verste grundvandsmagasin bliver koncentrations{\ae}ndringerne f{\o}rst rigtigt synlige mod slutningen af simuleringsperioden, men ikke i alle beregningspunkter. I 2013 er forskellen mellem den gennemsnitlige nitratkoncentration i det konventionelle og {\o}kologiske scenarie 9 procent (af koncentrationen for det konventionelle scenarie med redoxzone og DOC-nedbrydning implementeret), men det skylles at kun en lille del af det {\o}verste magasin har en alder p{\r a} 0-10 {\r a}r. Forts{\ae}ttes beregningerne derfor i yderligere 30 {\r a}r, vil den lavere udvaskning i det {\o}kologiske scenarie ogs{\r a} sl{\r a} v{\ae}sentligt kraftigere igennem p{\r a} grundvandskoncentrationerne. Men man kan alts{\r a} ikke forvente en umiddelbar effekt af en dyrkningsoml{\ae}gning p{\r a} en nitrattruet grundvandsindvinding.

Omkring 52 \% af nitraten, der forlader rodzonen i indsatsomr{\r a}det, reduceres i redoxzonen. Da dette g{\ae}lder for begge scenarier, er der i de p{\r a}g{\ae}ldende omr{\r a}der ingen effekt af oml{\ae}gning. DOC-betinget denitrifikation har fjernet yderligere ca 6 \% af nitraten i det konventionelle scenarie. Da den nedvaskede DOC-m{\ae}ngde er lille i beregningerne, kan dette tal v{\ae}re undervurderet, is{\ae}r i det {\o}kologiske scenarie. P{\r a} den anden side er det antaget, at alt DOC-nedbrydning medvirker til denitrifikation, hvilket er en overvurdering. Forskellen mellem denne beregning og det {\o}kologiske scenarie er kun yderligere 4 procent i 2013 (konservativ transport og  konventionelt scenarie = 100 \%).

I denne rapport er gjort en r{\ae}kke simple antagelser om nedbrydning, nitrifikation, denitrifikation og sorption i grundvandszonen. Antagelserne f{\o}rer til en udvikling i DOC og DON, der nogenlunde svarer til generelle observationer vedr{\o}rende koncentrationer og C/N-forhold, men der foreligger ikke m{\r a}ledata eller detailunders{\o}gelser, der kan anvendes til en mere detaljeret parameterisering og procesforst{\r a}else. For at opn{\r a} en bedre forst{\r a}else af betydningen af DOC-produktion p{\r a} denitrifikation, ikke mindst i {\o}kologisk produktion, kr{\ae}ves derfor yderligere unders{\o}gelser.

For organic agriculture the BIOM network was set up in 1998. Participating farmers improved their farm performance amongst others by a decrease of the hand labour for weed control and a reduction of the nutrient surpluses. The network also functioned as a facility for on-farm research on various topics. Additional effects of the close contacts between par-ticipants were a closer cooperation between farmers and an incentive for innovation},

        abstract = {Self-organised ecosystems are characterised by a high efficiency in the use of limited nutrient resources whereas the productivity is generally low. To utilise the potentials of agro-ecosystems with respect to a high nutrient efficiency, there is a need to steer the nutrient flow and provide good starting and adaptation conditions for living organisms. 
While organic standards provide no operational guidelines on how to improve nutrient management, a concept was developed to improve N-efficiency on the farm level. N-import into the farm and N-flow through subordinate sub-systems (?livestock?, ?dung storage/ distribution?, ?arable land/pasture?, and ?feed storage/distribution?) were assessed on 9 organic and 7 conventional dairy farms, based on farm specific data and by making use of equations from the literature to estimate relevant figures. 
N-efficiency varied considerably between sub-systems within and between farms, however showing no significant difference between the production methods. The results indicate a large but farm specific potential for improvements, contradicting any attempts of generalised statements and recommendations. Instead of minimum standards, a high level of N-efficiency that is beyond the average of conventional farms should be established as a leading aim in organic agriculture to justify claims.

        abstract = {As of August 2012, almost one year ago, organic wines can be labelled "organic", with the EU organic logo. This means wine can now be properly recognised as an organic product. Now that organic wine is fully integrated into EU legislation and therefore part of CAP (as well as being a subject for additional private standards), organic wine production - both in the vineyard and in winemaking - can be fully recognised as ecologically, economically and socially sound. We now have a solid basis for further development of the sector, and already we can see a positive response, with increasing production and new initiatives all over Europe.
In the past, wines could only be labelled as "made from organic grapes". The new legislative framework, established by Regulation (EC) No 834/2007, has been complemented by Regulation (EU) No 203/2012 that lays down detailed rules on organic winemaking and thus opened the door for organic wine in Europe.},

        abstract = {Fra 25.juni 2022 er regelverket for {\o}kologisk svinehold endra. Selvforsyningsgraden er {\o}kt, fra 20\% til 30\% egenprodusert f{\^o}r. Det er gitt et unntak for bruk av konvensjonelle proteinf{\^o}rkilder p{\r a} inntil 5\% fram til 31.12.2025, men bare for unge svin under 35 kg. Nytt i regelverket er krav til fast areal b{\r a}de innend{\o}rs og utend{\o}rs og krav til utforming av utearealet. Utearealet skal gj{\o}res attraktivt for grisene, og en skal helst velge arealer med tr{\ae}r eller skogsarealer. Grisene m{\r a} ha tilgang til leskur og kunne regulere kroppstemperaturen ved forskjellig utetemperatur. Tilrettelegging av et egna uteareal og beiteareal med et mangfold av plantevekster og et godt planlagt vekstskifte vil ogs{\r a} bidra til at selvforsyningsgraden fra egen g{\r a}rd kan {\o}kes b{\r a}de for purker og slaktegris. Vi har i denne rapporten beskrevet eksempler b{\r a}de fra litteraturen og g{\r a}rdsbes{\o}k, som oppfyller kravene i det nye regelverket. Det er viktig at storparten av utearealet kan holdes t{\o}rt, enten ved at
det er plassert h{\o}gt i terrenget og/eller er godt drenert. Det m{\r a} v{\ae}re b{\r a}de t{\o}rre og lune liggeplasser, men ogs{\r a} tilgang til gj{\o}rmebad og avkj{\o}ling. Arealet m{\r a} v{\ae}re stort nok til at grisen kan utfolde seg med roting og l{\o}ping og ogs{\r a} ha mulighet til {\r a} trekke seg unna for {\r a} unng{\r a} sl{\r a}ssing og aggresjon. Purker med unger m{\r a} ha nok plass. De eksemplene vi viser fra g{\r a}rder vi har bes{\o}kt hadde ca. 200 m2 per dyr, noe som er langt over minimumskravet til areal. Dette ga veldig gode l{\o}sninger med tilgang til beite og god plass til aktivitet og dermed ogs{\r a} redusert smittepress. Vegetasjonsbelter mot vassdrag er n{\o}dvendig for {\r a} hindre forurensning. Det er viktig {\r a} velge tr{\ae}r, busker og planter som hindrer erosjon og samler opp n{\ae}ringsstoffer. Isolerte hytter b{\r a}de for enkeltdyr og flere dyr sammen er gode l{\o}sninger, likeens flyttbare f{\^o}ringsautomater eller f{\^o}ringstroer med tak. Hyttene b{\o}r flyttes rundt p{\r a} beitet for {\r a} hindre at det blir for opptr{\r a}kket og bl{\o}tt. Innhengning for {\r a} samle dyr n{\r a}r det er behov for det er ogs{\r a} n{\o}dvendig. Alternativet til flyttbare hytter er {\r a} anlegge beite i n{\ae}rheten av fj{\o}sbygninger der dyra kan ha tilgang til ly og varme, eller avkj{\o}ling, om det trengs. Inngjerding av grisene fungerer godt med elektrisk gjerde, med to eller tre tr{\r a}der i riktig h{\o}yde for {\r a} holde gris av ulik alder og st{\o}rrelse innenfor. Grisen reagerer sterkt p{\r a} str{\o}m. Gjerdet m{\r a} kontrolleres daglig. Det er usikkert hvor godt elektriske gjerder vil holde villsvin ute. Andre former for inngjerding kan v{\ae}re sm{\r a}maska nettinggjerder, nedgravd 50-60 cm for {\r a} hindre dyr i {\r a} grave seg ned under gjerdet. Ved mistanke eller varsel om villsvin eller annen risiko for smittsom sykdom, b{\o}r dyra kunne settes inn og sikres for en periode. Generelt er det viktig {\r a} bruke rikelig med str{\o}. Halm er best for {\r a} holde varmen og som rotemateriale, men det kan ogs{\r a} brukes skogsflis og kombinasjoner av ulike materialer, selv om disse har noe d{\r a}rligere isolerende egenskaper. Det er mulig {\r a} legge til rette for utegris og {\o}kologisk produksjon i samsvar med nye regler de fleste steder i Norge, ogs{\r a} om vinteren. N{\o}dvendige investeringer er lavere med hytter og enkle fj{\o}s enn med konvensjonelle grisefj{\o}s, men driftsforma er noe mer arbeidskrevende. Det m{\r a} planlegges mer tid til tilsyn og stell. Vaksinasjon og systematisk parasittbehandling og vekstskifte er viktig for {\r a} unng{\r a} sykdom. Det samme er mer omtanke i avlsarbeidet, der en legger mer vekt p{\r a} robuste dyr i det milj{\o}et de skal v{\ae}re. Det er sv{\ae}rt f{\r a} som driver med {\o}kologisk gris i Norge. I intervju sier de som allerede driver med det at de {\o}nsker mer kunnskap og forskning p{\r a} {\o}kt selvforsyningsgrad av protein, alternativer til antibiotika og parasittmidler, egne avlsm{\r a}l for utegris, grovf{\^o}ropptak og mer kunnskap om beiterotasjon.},

Neither the cows nor the calves were given concentrates in the period. The pasture was of generally poor quality, and the results could have been even more in favour of weight gain in calves and with less weight loss of cows on a high-quality pasture.
The cows were Limousin crosses. They were not milked, only suckled by their calves. Three foster calves were removed from their foster mothers because they obviously did not get enough milk. The behaviour observations showed that these calves did not manage to suckle neither their foster mother nor the other cows to some particular degree. The other calves showed good weight gain and health, and the cows? body condition remained fairly stable even though the pasture quality was poor. Weaning was abrupt, but cows and calves stopped bawling after 3-4 days.
The control-group calves kept indoors had a higher weight gain, but these were also fed more intensively. 
We tested a collar with an accelerometer to see if it is possible to use the data to distinguish between different types of behaviour. Preliminary results show that it is easy to tell the difference between being ?active? and ?passive?, and there are indications that it is possible to distinguish suckling from other activities. These results can contribute to developing systems for monitoring grazing livestock.},

        abstract = {Gjennom dette prosjektet, finansiert av Regionalt forskingsfond Midt-Norge og Regionalt forskingsfond M{\o}re og Romsdal, Tr{\o}ndelag fylkeskommune, M{\o}re og Romsdal fylkeskommune, Talg{\o} M{\o}reTre AS, {\O}kologisk Norge og Nors{\o}k har vi gjennom litteraturstudium, sp{\o}rreunders{\o}kelse og feltfors{\o}k sett p{\r a} muligheter for {\r a} utvikle et mer kretsl{\o}psbasert driftssystem for {\o}kologisk slaktekylling med tilrettelagt uteomr{\r a}de.
Vi har sammenlignet to ulike saktevoksende hybrider, rowan ranger og sasso, p{\r a} uteomr{\r a}de med bare grasvekst eller mer beplanta uteomr{\r a}de og studert tilvekst, f{\^o}rforbruk og atferd. Sasso er en enda mer saktevoksende hybrid enn rowan ranger. Videre har vi planlagt kyllinghus med tilrettelagt uteomr{\r a}de og sett p{\r a} {\o}konomi, milj{\o} og muligheter for sirkul{\ae}re verdikjeder knyttet til {\o}kologisk kyllingproduksjon.
I fors{\o}ket fant vi at rowan ranger n{\r a}dde h{\o}yere vekt ved slaktalder p{\r a} 72 dager enn sasso. Beplantning hadde positiv effekt p{\r a} vekta p{\r a} dag 64, men det var ingen forskjell ved slaktetidspunktet. Kraftf{\^o}ropptaket var ikke forskjellig for de to hybridene og vegetasjonen hadde ikke effekt p{\r a} f{\^o}ropptaket. Rowan ranger hadde h{\o}yere tilvekst og f{\^o}reffektivitet enn sasso. Sasso oppholdt seg mer ute, var mer aktiv og brukte st{\o}rre del av utearealet enn rowan ranger. Beplantning stimulerte bruk av uteomr{\r a}de for begge hybridene. Kyllingene hadde st{\o}rst f{\^o}rrelatert aktivitet p{\r a} uteomr{\r a}de om kvelden, deretter om morgenen, mens de var mye i ro midt p{\r a} dagen n{\r a}r det var sol og varmt.
Beplantning og tilrettelegging av uteareal b{\o}r skje i god tid f{\o}r arealet tas i bruk til kyllingene slik at plantene f{\r a}r etablert seg og gir skjerming, ly og muligheter for f{\^o}ropptak. Det er beskrevet plantetyper, plantem{\o}nster og nytteverdi av de ulike plantene.
Kortikosteron er et hormon som sier noe om stress og p{\r a}kjenninger hos et dyr, og vi m{\r a}lte kortikosteron i fj{\ae}r p{\r a} kyllingene dagen f{\o}r slakting. Niv{\r a}et var h{\o}yere hos hanene enn hos h{\o}nene og det var tendens til h{\o}yere niv{\r a} hos rowan ranger enn hos sasso.
Modulbaserte kyllinghus i tre synes {\r a} v{\ae}re godt egna og er konkurransedyktige i pris for b{\r a}de {\o}kologisk og konvensjonell kyllingproduksjon og i ulik skala. Kyllinghus produsert i tre har et lavere milj{\o}avtrykk enn hus av st{\r a}l og betong.
Det konseptet vi beskriver i rapporten er tilrettelagt for bruk av uteareal, og utearealet er planlagt slik at det annethvert {\r a}r f{\r a}r hvile for kyllingene og kan brukes til planteproduksjon, som korn eller gr{\o}nnsaker og rotvekster.
V{\r a}re {\o}konomiske beregninger fra fors{\o}ket viser at dekningsbidraget (inkl. faste kostnader) er p{\r a} ca. 15,50 kr/kylling for rowan ranger og ca. 8 kr/kylling for sasso i en produksjon p{\r a} 72 000 kyllinger/{\r a}r. I mindre skala (10 800 kyllinger/{\r a}r) og med et enklere bygg, er dekningsbidraget ca. 14 kr/kylling for rowan ranger og ca. 7 kr/kylling for sasso. Dekningsbidraget er h{\o}yere enn for konvensjonell kylling, noe som skyldes merpris for {\o}kologisk kylling og h{\o}yere slaktevekt.
Sp{\o}rreunders{\o}kelser viser at forbrukere er stadig mer opptatt av dyrevelferd og de sier de er villige til {\r a} betale merpris for god dyrevelferd og milj{\o}vennlig produksjon. En sp{\o}rreunders{\o}kelse vi gjorde blant 2000 forbrukere viste at 65\% var villige til {\r a} betale en merpris p{\r a} 20\% eller mer for bedre dyrevelferd i kyllingproduksjonen. Over 70\% av de som ble spurt syntes fj{\o}rfe skal ha tilgang til uteomr{\r a}de. Samtidig sier markedsakt{\o}rene at det er vanskelig {\r a} kommunisere at det er behov for merpris for {\o}kologisk kylling.
Integrert {\o}kologisk kylling- og planteproduksjon kan gi bedre {\o}konomi, bedre ressursutnyttelse og bedre milj{\o}profil n{\r a}r en tar i betraktning flere milj{\o}parametere enn klimagassutslipp, samt inkluderer bruken av arealet til produksjon av eget f{\^o}r eller matvekster. F{\^o}ret utgj{\o}r en vesentlig del av klimagassutslipp fra produksjonen og ved {\r a} disponere utearealet som tilh{\o}rer produksjonsenheten til lokalprodusert f{\^o}r kan det erstatte litt av det innkj{\o}pte/importerte {\o}kologiske f{\^o}ret.},

        abstract = {I dette regionale forprosjektet har vi sett p{\r a} muligheter for enkle og rimelige ombygginger i melkeproduksjonsfj{\o}s for {\r a} gi mulighet for lengre tids samv{\ae}r mellom ku og kalv. 
Vi har studert samspillet mellom automatiske melke- og f{\^o}ringssystemer og f{\^o}ropptak, tilvekst, helse og atferd hos kalver som har f{\r a}tt g{\r a} sammen med m{\o}drene sine i en egen velferdsavdeling i en m{\r a}ned f{\o}r de ble separert og flytta over i en egen binge. Ett form{\r a}l var {\r a} se p{\r a} om kalvene har mulighet for {\r a} l{\ae}re seg automatiske f{\^o}ringsl{\o}sninger samtidig med at de har tilgang p{\r a} mora, uten for mye ekstra arbeid for bonden og uten at investeringene i fj{\o}sbygget blir for store.
Kalvene hadde god tilvekst i dieperioden (797 g/dag) men tapte seg mye ved separasjon (tilvekst p{\r a} 190 g/dag etter separasjon). 3 av 7 kalver l{\ae}rte seg {\r a} drikke av melkeautomaten med det minimale tidsforbruket vi brukte p{\r a} oppl{\ae}ring i dette fors{\o}ket, i gjennomsnitt drakk de 6,6 liter/dag. Bare 4 av 7 kalver begynte {\r a} ta til seg kraftf{\^o}r etter separasjonen. Selv om kalvene oppholdt seg mye av tida i kalvegjemme med automatf{\^o}ring ogs{\r a} i dieperioden, og selv om de var nysgjerrige og gikk inn i automaten flere ganger per dag, l{\ae}rte de ikke {\r a} drikke av den. Det b{\o}r derfor brukes mer tid og finnes andre l{\o}sninger for raskere oppl{\ae}ring til melkef{\^o}ring av kalvene hvis en ikke vil la dem g{\r a} sammen med mor til de avvennes gradvis ved 7-9 uker. 
For bondens {\o}konomi vil grad av fylling av melkekvoten v{\ae}re avgj{\o}rende for hvor lenge det l{\o}nner seg {\r a} la kalven die mora. Prisen p{\r a} melkeerstatning og melk til kalven er om lag det samme dersom kvoten ikke er fylt, mens det vil l{\o}nne seg {\r a} bruke egen melk, fersk eller syrna, dersom kvoten likevel blir fylt. 
Av 14 kyr som var med i fors{\o}ket var det 6 kyr som ikke leverte noe melk i roboten. 8 kyr leverte melk i roboten og gjennomsnittlig dagsleveranse varierte fra 6,7 til 35,8 liter. For 7 kyr som vi fulgte b{\r a}de i dieperioden og etter separasjon {\o}kte daglig melkeleveranse fra 20,6 liter i dieperioden til 33,1 liter etter separasjon. Gjennomsnittlig celletall varierte fra 37 til 335 og var generelt litt h{\o}yere mens kyrne gitt med kalv, men forskjellen var ikke signifikant. Vi registrerte lite feilmelkinger i roboten og en av 14 kyr ble behandlet for mastitt. 
I prosjektet har vi bes{\o}kt flere g{\r a}rder som har tenkt p{\r a} mulighet for {\r a} ha ku og kalv sammen, og vi har sett p{\r a} hvordan det kan tilrettelegges for et slikt driftsopplegg med enkle l{\o}sninger i eksisterende fj{\o}s. Vi legger fram fire forslag til l{\o}sninger med kostnadsoverslag som kan ha overf{\o}ringsverdi til andre. P{\r a} bakgrunn av dette fors{\o}ket ser vi at det er avgj{\o}rende med en god logistikk i fj{\o}set, der det f{\o}rst er en rein og t{\o}rr f{\o}debinge (eller fellesbinge for flere kyr) der mora og kalven f{\r a}r v{\ae}re i fred de f{\o}rste d{\o}gna, deretter kan de g{\r a} i en velferdsavdeling der kua har tilgang til melkerobot og kalvene samtidig har tilgang til eget kalvegjemme for tilleggsf{\^o}ring og hvile, f{\o}r de gradvis separeres og avvennes fra mora. Tidspunkt og metode for avvenning m{\r a} ogs{\r a} tilpasses bonden. Vi har l{\ae}rt mye ved sanntids kameraoverv{\r a}king av kyr og kalver i dette fors{\o}ket og mener det er viktig {\r a} fortsette arbeidet med {\r a} teste ut flere metoder og forbedringer til hvordan vi kan l{\ae}re kalvene {\r a} ta opp f{\^o}r fra automater slik at avvenning og separasjon kan g{\r a} enda bedre. Dette b{\o}r i tilfelle gj{\o}res i et st{\o}rre fors{\o}k med mulighet til {\r a} gjennomf{\o}re innl{\ae}ringsaktiviteter for kalvene.},

Many of these products are important for the tourism and they are also important for the world heritage status itself. For agriculture not to be just a ?backdrop agriculture?, but a part of a viable operating system, it is now important to develop a new model for agricultural policy instruments in such areas, as well as new sustainable business models for local value creation. Dialogue, democratic planning processes and partnership building can promote responsible participation. There are many research needs for world heritage sites and corresponding areas with large and untapped resources, and the project group?s assessment is concretized in this report.}

Bakgrunnen er at det har v{\ae}rt antatt at forbudet mot bruk av koksidiostatika i {\o}kologisk produksjon vil f{\o}re til mer sjukdom og {\o}kt bruk av antibiotika. Med forbehold om at det er sv{\ae}rt f{\r a} {\o}kologiske besetninger, gir unders{\o}kelsen ikke indikasjoner p{\r a} at kokidiostatikaforbudet f{\o}rer til {\o}kt bruk av antibiotika i {\o}kologisk fj{\o}rfekj{\o}ttproduksjon.  Ingen av de fire {\o}kologiske besetningene har brukt noen form for antibiotika i kyllingproduksjonen i tidsrommet 2012-2015, som er tidsintervallet for unders{\o}kelsen. Det har v{\ae}rt noen f{\r a} tilfeller av antibiotikabehandling av {\o}kologisk kalkun. Vaksine som forebyggende tiltak er brukt rutinemessig i en av de fire besetningene, to besetninger vaksinerer ikke, mens en besetning har en liten andel vaksinerte kyllinger.   Det har v{\ae}rt registrert lite sykdom og marginalt {\o}kt d{\o}delighet i de {\o}kologiske besetningene sammenligna med konvensjonelle.

Det er derfor av interesse {\r a} studere n{\ae}rmere om det er forhold i {\o}kologiske driftssystemer som kan v{\ae}re med og redusere risikoen for sykdom med p{\r a}f{\o}lgende antibiotikabehandling, selv om v{\r a}rt datamateriale er lite fordi det er f{\r a} {\o}kologiske besetninger.

Det tradisjonelle landbruket i desse omr{\r a}da har skapt verdfulle naturgode som biologisk mangfald, opne turomr{\r a}de med h{\o}g rekreasjonsverdi, turstiar og anna. Fleire av desse naturgoda er viktige for reiselivsn{\ae}ringa. Kulturlandskapet er ogs{\r a} viktig for verdsarvstatusen i seg sj{\o}lv, ettersom dette er ein viktig del av kjerneverdiane til omr{\r a}det (OUV). 
Utviklinga i landbruket gjer at tungdrivne areal ogs{\r a} i verdsarvomr{\r a}da g{\r a}r ut av bruk. Opph{\o}yr eller l{\r a}g bruksintensitet g{\r a}r spesielt ut over utmarksressursane og dei seminaturlege naturtypane. Utmarka i Geirangerfjordomr{\r a}det er s{\ae}rleg trua, da tradisjonell bruk med beiting, sl{\r a}tt og hausting no i stor grad har teke slutt, og naturtypane gror att med buskar og kratt. Gjengroing f{\o}rer til tap av variasjon, artar og {\o}kologiske funksjonar. Intensivering av landbruket vil ogs{\r a} forringe naturverdiane og landskapskvalitetane.
For at landbruket ikkje berre skal vere eit ?kulisselandbruk?, men vere del av eit berekraftig driftssystem, m{\r a} tilgjengelege arealressursar p{\r a} innmark og utmark nyttast til matproduksjon og andre livsviktige {\o}kosystemtenester. Gjeldande landbrukspolitikk, med m{\r a}l om stordrift og effektivisering av matproduksjonen, er ei sterkare drivkraft enn dei tiltaka som er sett inn for {\r a} bremse og motverke at tungdrivne areal g{\r a}r ut av bruk i verdsarvomr{\r a}da.
Den lokale turist- og reiselivsn{\ae}ringa kan ogs{\r a} hamne i noko av same marginaliserte situasjonen som landbruksn{\ae}ringa fordi dei ikkje lenger er dei mest sentrale akt{\o}rane. Eksterne akt{\o}rar representert ved cruiseindustri, turbussar og storskala reisearrang{\o}rar er ofte i enda st{\o}rre grad premissleverand{\o}rar.
Det trengs ei heilskapleg tiln{\ae}rming for {\r a} l{\o}yse utfordringane. Ein prosess som forskyv maktbalansen fr{\r a} eksterne akt{\o}rar innan masseturisme og i retning lokalt n{\ae}ringsliv og verdiskaping og som inkluderer innbyggjarane, krev nytenking, utvikling av nye forretningsmodellar og evne til gjennomf{\o}ring gjennom demokratiske planprosessar.  
Av ulike konkrete verkemiddel som kan pr{\o}vast ut, men da helst som element i ein st{\o}rre endringsprosess, vil vi peike p{\r a} s{\ae}rskilde landbrukspolitiske verkemiddel i retning sveitsisk modell, turistskatt, anna betaling for fellesgode og bygdeutviklingsprosjekt som kan gi auka tilflytting og ny n{\ae}ringsaktivitet. Dialog og partnarskapsbygging kan fremme ansvarleg medverknad.

        abstract = {Utgangspunktet for prosjektet var {\r a} unders{\o}ke potensialet for {\o}kt verdiskaping i kystsonen, med Nerlands{\o}y i Her{\o}y kommune, M{\o}re og Romsdal, som studieomr{\r a}de. Vi har lagt til rette for {\r a} etablere langtidsserier for ulike parametre som vi mener vil gi {\o}kt kunnskap om klimaendringer og p{\r a}virkning p{\r a} {\o}kosystem og n{\ae}ringsutvikling i kystsonen.
Arealbruksendringer:
Jordbruksareal og utmarksareal er viktige naturressurser. God forvaltning og sikring av arealet er avgj{\o}rende for {\r a} beholde og {\o}ke verdiskapinga. Andre n{\ae}ringer har stor betydning for bosettinga p{\r a} {\o}ya. Det betyr at Nerlands{\o}y er interessant {\r a} f{\o}lge over tid n{\r a}r det gjelder forvaltning av arealene.
Nerlands{\o}y er en velegna studielokalitet fordi det fortsatt er aktivt landbruk der og det er mulighet for fortsatt og {\o}kt matproduksjon fra landbruket. Store deler av f{\^o}ret hentes fra beite i utmarka, noe som bidrar til lavere klimagassutslipp p{\r a} det kj{\o}ttet som produseres n{\r a}r en tar hensyn til nye beregningsm{\r a}ter for metanutslipp fra dr{\o}vtyggere. 
Kystlyngheia: 
P{\r a} Nerlands{\o}y er det et helt spesielt og verdifullt og godt kartlagt kulturlandskap. Her har en mulighet til {\r a} f{\o}lge utviklinga p{\r a} areal som er skj{\o}tsla gjennom rydding og brenning. Studiet viser blant annet, med Ystevika som eksempel, at kystlyngheiene p{\r a}virkes av ekstremv{\ae}r som vintert{\o}rke.
Biologisk mangfold ? sammensetning av insektsamfunnet:
Mengde og artssammensetning av insekter er en viktig indikator p{\r a} tilstanden n{\r a}r det gjelder biodiversitet i et omr{\r a}de. Vi har kartlagt insektsamfunnet p{\r a} en lokalitet mellom Kvalsvika og Ystevika, i samarbeid med NINA.
Jordsmonn og produksjonspotensiale:
Jordsmonnet p{\r a} Nerlands{\o}y er relativt n{\ae}ringsfattig, men enkelte steder gir morene og rasmateriale med gode sigevannsforhold fruktbar jord. Jordsmonnet er fattig p{\r a} en del essensielle mikromineraler, noe lokaliteten har til felles med resten av kysten. Det betyr at det er behov for {\r a} finne alternativer til gj{\o}dsling som tilf{\o}rer jorda mineraler og dermed ogs{\r a} {\o}kt mineralinnhold i beitegras og vinterf{\^o}r.
Dyrehelse:
Varmere klima kan gi {\o}kt mulighet for planteproduksjon, men ogs{\r a} problemer med skadegj{\o}rere og smitte som vi ikke har i dag. For husdyr vet vi at sjukdom kan bli et problem og for{\r a}rsake tap og d{\r a}rlig dyrevelferd og {\o}kt risiko for sjukdommer som kan smitte fra dyr til mennesker. Parasitter kan bli et problem n{\r a}r samme husdyrart beiter p{\r a} samme areal {\r a}r etter {\r a}r, og et mildere klima kan gi st{\o}rre problemer. P{\r a} Nerlands{\o}y var sauene behandla mot parasitter, likevel fant vi overraskende mye parasitter hos dyra. Videre kartlegging av parasittbelastning og planlegging av beitebruk for {\r a} redusere problemet er viktige sp{\o}rsm{\r a}l {\r a} f{\o}lge opp over lengre tid.
En annen ?skummel? parasitt er skogfl{\r a}tten, Ixodes ricinus, som trives bedre under varmere og v{\r a}tere klima. Alle dyr er utsatt for fl{\r a}tt og kan bli smitta med sjodoggbakterien A.phagocytophilum eller andre bakterier som kan gi alvorlig sjukdom hos dyr og mennesker. I et av beiteomr{\r a}da fant vi at alle lamma var smitta med sjodoggbakterien.},

        abstract = {The Norwegian Centre for Organic Agriculture (NORS{\O}K), in collaboration with the Norwegian Agricultural Extension Service (NLR), Debio and the Norwegian Association of Sheep and Goat Farmers (NSG), has written this report to provide practical solutions to meet the requirements of the EU-regulation about a solid lying area for at least 0,75 m2 of 1,5 m2 per sheep and 0,18 m2 of 0,35 m2 per lamb in organic production.

In a survey done by Debio, which was answered by 354 of Norwegians 579 organic sheep producers, 37 \% answered that they either had to make changes with the new regulations or that they didn?t know. Half of these respondents thought it would be difficult and comprehensive to adapt to the new requirements. Some of them would rather switch to conventional production or quit working with sheep production. 

We have made drawings and cost estimates for six different examples in this report. To satisfy the requirement about solid lying area for sheep, there are two main alternatives; either wooden resting platforms with or without rubber mats, or deep bedding of wood chip or straw. 

With a resting platform, it?s important that the entire sheep can lie down comfortably on the solid area. At the same time, it shouldn?t be too much work with cleaning the resting platforms. A narrow resting platform with much slope will maintain clean without extra work, but the sheep prefer to lie where it?s no slope. We recommend resting platforms with a width of 0,60-0,80 m and a slope up to 10 \%, as well as adding a little wood chip to the platforms daily. Wood chip keep the resting platforms softer, cleaner and less slippery. 

If you use deep bedding, this can be for the whole area of the barn, but it may be advantageous to have draining floor like expanded metal by the feeding area, or have free access to an outdoor area and feed the sheep outside. In some buildings, the best solution may be a combination where some parts inside the building have drainage floors and resting platforms, and other parts, like simple, uninsulated extensions of the building, have deep bedding of either wood chip or straw.},

Most of the land of family farms requires intensive soil use and, consequently, promotes soil loss, water and nutrients by erosion. Coffee conilon and grazing are the main systems of food production in the region. The aim of this study was to estimate, during the rainy season, soil loss and nutrient of areas under coffee cultivation systems under conservation (and agroforestry with management of soil cover) and conventional tillage (non-coverage soil). Collectors of soil and water were installed in 6 observation units, being 2 in conventional systems, 3 in conservationists systems and 1 in native forest that was used as a reference. Meteorological data were collected at the rainy season of 2009/2010. The soil and water losses estimated for the period, were higher (98 and 68\%) in the conventional systems compared to conservation systems. Potassium was the nutrient that had higher losses in the systems (from 0.17 to 33 g/ha, respectively).}

        abstract = {To obtain the best possible net energy balance of the bioethanol production the biomass raw materials used need to be produced with limited use of non-renewable fossil fuels. Intercropping strategies are known to maximize growth and productivity by including more than one species in the crop stand, very often with legumes as one of the components. In the present study clover-grass is undersown in a traditional wheat crop. Thereby, it is possible to increase input of symbiotic fixation of atmospheric nitrogen into the cropping systems and reduce the need for fertilizer applications. Furthermore, when using such wheat and clover-grass mixtures as raw material, addition of urea and other fermentation nutrients produced from fossil fuels can be reduced in the whole ethanol manufacturing chain. Using second generation ethanol technology mixtures of relative proportions of wheat straw and clover-grass (15:85, 50:50, and 85:15) were pretreated by wet oxidation. The results showed that supplementing wheat straw with clover-grass had a positive effect on the ethanol yield in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation experiments, and the effect was more pronounced in inhibitory substrates. The highest ethanol yield (80\% of theoretical) was obtained in the experiment with high fraction (85\%) of clover-grass. In order to improve the sugar recovery of clover-grass, it should be separated into a green juice (containing free sugars, fructan, amino acids, vitamins and soluble minerals) for direct fermentation and a fibre pulp for pretreatment together with wheat straw. Based on the obtained results a decentralized biorefinery concept for production of biofuel is suggested emphasizing sustainability, localness, and recycling principles}

Projektet finansieres af Organic RDD 2 programmet under F{\o}devare-ministeriet og gennemf{\o}res som et samarbejde mellem Aarhus Universitet, SEGES, DLG, Top-{\ae}g Aps og {\O}kologiske fjerkr{\ae}producenter (for yderligere oplysninger om projekt se: http://icrofs.dk/forskning/dansk-forskning/multichick/). En af opgaverne i MultiChick projektet er at identificere mulige udviklingsveje for produktion og afs{\ae}tning, der kan sikre {\o}kologiske kyllinger en h{\o}jere markedsandel. I regi af projektet, har der v{\ae}ret afholdt en workshop p{\r a} Gothenborg den 12. maj 2015. Denne rapport er vores bearbejdede kondensat af opl{\ae}g, diskussioner og konklusioner fra workshoppen.

        abstract = {One core idea behind organic production is that cropping  systems should be less dependent on resource import than conventional production and minimize negative environmental effects. This study aimed to test novel organic rotations, designed to reduce reliance on external resource import. We compared a conventional system (C) and an organic system relying on manure import (O1) to two rotations (O2 and O3), both relying on autumn cover crops for soil fertility, and in O3 green manure rows were left as intercrops. Resource import differed between 149, 85, 25 and 25 kg N ha-1 year-1 in C, O1, O2 and O3.
Crop yields were lower in the organic systems (on average 82\% of conventional yields), differing among crops, when based on the area grown with main crops. In O3, some of the vegetable field area was allocated to intercrops, so vegetable yields ha-1 were only 63\% of conventional yields. Differences in crop quality parameters, e.g. damages by pests/diseases were few and not systematic. Clear effects on nutrient balances and nitrogen leaching indicators were found but only few effects on root growth were observed. However, green manures almost doubled the soil exploration (0-2.4 m) by active roots from 21\% (C) to 38\% (O2). Average subsoil (1-2 m) inorganic N content was 74 and 61 kg N ha-1 in C and O1 vs. only 22 and 21 kg N ha-1 in O2 and O3, indicating strongly reduced N leaching loss in O2 and O3. In short, the main distinctions were observed between systems based mainly on nutrient import (C, O1) vs. systems based mainly on green manure (O2, O3), rather than between conventional and organic systems.

Network (SATNET), National Organic Agriculture Movement of Uganda (NOGAMU) and Organic Denmark (OD) has seen the establishment of over 130 ecological Farmer Family Learning Groups (FFLGs) in the Rwenzori region composed of up to 3255 farming families.
Compared to the forms of conventional agriculture in which much effort has been invested in this part of the country and in the country as a whole, the FFLGs in the Rwenzori region clearly demonstrate the social and economic benefits of agricultural development approaches based on ecological/organic alternatives and strengthening of farmer collaboration. While environmental dimensions form an important motivation behind these efforts, this paper emphasize the social and economic benefits the FFLGs have fetched out of the use of ecological/organic farming alternatives. 
Socially, ecological farming in FFLGs has yielded benefits such as; Promoting/sustaining the culture of sharing agro-inputs, Social capital building at community level where the FFLGs operate, Learning and innovation collaborations among farmers on varying farm conditions, Guaranteed trust that is vital for collective marketing of produce that leads to higher incomes,  and; appreciation for indigenous knowledge that builds confidence among farmers and serves as a stronghold for adoption of approved ecological innovations.
On the economic aspect, attributes of ecological farming methods in the FFLGs such as; Cost cutting particularly on labor through farmers working together on each other?s farm, Cost effective Seed management systems that overcome the costly seed dependence common among conventional farmers , Increased production and  productivity associated with optimum use of the ecological potential of farm lands and Ecological resilience to economic losses achieved through diversified farming and timely planting. 
The above benefits associated with ecological/organic farming alternatives are equally important in justifying the FFLG approach and must be made more visible not least given their potential role in convincing other stakeholders of the merits of these efforts.},

Organic farming systems rely on the management of biological cycles for the provision of nutrients, which are crucial to maximising the production from the system. Rotations based on the use of grass-legume leys are central to the concept of organic farming systems, because they have the potential to support both animal production, and a subsequent, exploitative, arable cropping phase. A major challenge in organic farming is managing the supply of nitrogen, since it has a key role in governing both productivity and environmental impact. Hence, within a rotational system, there is a need to understand the complex interactions that are occurring between crop species and management, livestock production system and the impact of soil and climate on these processes. To understand these interactions, a framework is being developed for rotational farming systems that describes the soil nitrogen, crop growth and livestock production. The framework must address questions that are relevant to researchers and extensions workers. Typical questions relate to the management of nutrients in the short and long-term. Additionally, there are concerns over the impact of weeds, pests and diseases on productivity, as well as the impact of adopting new strategies or crops on the farming system.},

We established field trial with replications on two lucerne varieties in Menemen, Turkey, in 2018. At first cut in 2019 whole plant and six different fractions were processed and sampled. Across varieties, juice, leaves and leaf juice yields accounted for 45\%, 53\% and 24\% of the whole plant dry matter yield, respectively. Crude protein content was higher in leaf juice (26\%) than whole plant juice (23\%) and the content in leaves differed between the varieties (22\% and 27\%). Leaf stripping separated a higher proportion (on average 70\%) of the total crude protein in the plant than juice production (on average 55\%). The effects of variety, harvesting time and number of cut need further investigation.},

        abstract = {Transitions to more sustainable livestock production systems are increasingly being considered and scientists suggest to move towards diversified farming systems due to their potential environmental and economic benefits, especially in the organic sector. However, empirical knowledge of multi-species livestock farms, i.e. farms keeping two or more animal species, is lacking. 
Our objectives were to identify European organic multi-species livestock farms that outperform their peers despite having the same resources and constraints, and characterize their distinctive management principles.
We conducted surveys on 102 farms in seven European countries: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland, and we kept 86 farms from the initial sample that had complete data. These farms included 19 different combinations of large ruminants, small ruminants, large and small ruminants, and large ruminants and monogastrics. We implemented a positive deviance approach based on four indicators: land productivity, nitrogen input dependence, nitrogen balance and satisfaction regarding income.
Six structurally diverse positive deviant farms were identified with multiple types of livestock combinations represented, and farmland area ranging from 25.3 to 199.3 ha, herd size from 26 to 126.3 livestock units (LU) and total workforce size from 2 to 5 annual worker units (AWU). Most of these farms had high overall autonomy for feed (85-97\% against a mean of 75\% for the whole sample) by fostering diversity of pastures, crops and livestock and promoting interactions among farm activities in ways (e.g. matter flows, co-grazing, crop rotations including pastures, etc.) that benefited the whole system. Diversity of production activities allowed four out of the six farmers to develop direct selling which was well suited to support their farming strategies oriented towards high autonomy for feed. Diversity was also found besides agricultural production through e.g. agritourism. Some farmers, especially in farms with co-farmers, had found organizational models suited to control their workload and to take free days throughout the year by efficiently planning, distributing, and sharing tasks. This strategy allowed them to save time for networking with other farmers to access to information, support, and equipment.  
We conducted the first integrated study on European organic multi-species livestock farms and identified key management principles implemented on positive deviant farms. These principles will inform farmers running multi-species livestock farms or transitioning to this model.},

To fill this knowledge gap, we surveyed a sample of 128 European organic multi-species livestock farms located across seven countries ? Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland ? and covering a large range of livestock species combinations. We recorded 1574 variables as raw data out of which we calculated 107 indicators describing farm structure, management and several sustainability dimensions: resource use efficiency and conservation, animal, land and work productivities, animal and human welfare. After technical validation of the data, we withdrew 26 farms and the database covers 102 farms. This database is well suited to unveil relationships between various dimensions of organic multi-species livestock farm sustainability and their structure and management. It can help reveal sustainable strategies for organic multi-species livestock farming systems and understand levers or barriers to their development.}

Recently, several countries including England and Sweden have advocated the elimination of direct payments after 2013. The extent to which an elimination of direct payments would affect the land use dynamics in Europe including impacts on structural change and the environment has not been addressed in the existing literature. In this paper, we combine participatory methods, to analyze regional preferences for functions and effects of agriculture, and farm-level modeling, to assess the impacts of such a policy change on farm structures and land use intensities in four European regions located in Germany, Denmark, Italy and Poland, each with different socio-economic and biophysical characteristics. In each region, the entire farm population consisting of different farm types with different production orientations and land management types was modeled under the presence and absence of direct payments using a combination of agent-based and bio-economic modeling. We found that the initial characteristics of the regions, such as the historical farm structure and regional site conditions, greatly influence the impact of direct support elimination and cause regionally different development trends. The results for the four regions were summarized in four specific storylines that emphasize how much the diversity of European regions matters for future policy decisions. An explicitly regional focus is, therefore, argued to be crucial to complement future policy analysis.},

        abstract = {Over the last 80 years a wide range of diverse organic livestock systems have developed. The driving force behind these developments has mainly been the farmers, consumers and various movements; and it has happened more ?despite research? than ?because of research.? Most production methods have developed in Western Europe and USA, where they are primarily niche products for consumers who give priority to environmental and animal welfare concerns. In these countries organic livestock production offers the option of establishing a niche product that can be sold at a higher price, e.g. as for milk and eggs. In some cases, the potential of organic farming is associated with the adoption of organic principles into existing systems with the aim of improving sustainability, and achieving environmentally friendly production, food security and good food quality. In the US, government support for organic research, some of which was for livestock studies, increased from 15 million dollars in 2002 to 78 million in 2008. In Australia where more than 95\% of the certified organic land is pasture, government-supported research tends to focus on organic dairy and meat production. In addition, research into agro-forestry systems is also of potential interest to the Australian organic sector. In many African and Asian countries, organic livestock plays a very minor role compared with production of high value organic crops, and hence is not covered specifically in research initiatives. A recent survey on African organically-oriented research projects concluded that no significant research focuses on organic livestock. In South America, a number of research projects have been carried out on integrated agro-ecological farming, which includes livestock. These are not necessarily certified organic systems, as ?organic? is often perceived as high value products, while ?agro-ecological farming? is basically the application of the fundamental organic principles, so research in these systems provides valuable insights for organic research in general.
Research is necessary for many reasons, but at a fundamental level it is relevant to both provide specialised knowledge relevant to organic situations (e.g. feed stuffs) and to take a systems approach through interdisciplinary research (e.g. how grazing systems integrate good animal welfare aims with environmental care). A third aspect important to consider is the human and social structures around organic livestock systems, e.g. farmer attitudes, actions, practices and interactions
with advisory services.},

from its mother a few hours after birth. The public debate
on the subject has increased, and views on whether the calf
should be allowed to stay with its dam for weeks are debated
among citizens, farmers, and advisors. The aim of this article is to present, analyse, and discuss experiences and arguments on dam-rearing of calves through interviews with actors, primarily farmers, involved in organic dairy farming in four European countries. The interviews showed that dam-rearing is practiced in a wealth of different systems, and four main points of view should be considered: that of the calf, the cow, the farmer, and the farming system. Three important qualities of cow calf contact systems are described from the animals? perspective: 1) nutrition, 2) care, and 3) learning. The discussion included ethical considerations referring to the principle of fairness as expressed by the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM). Wellbalanced and managed dam-rearing systems are suggested to contribute significantly to the physiological development and natural behaviour of mother cows and calves. The calves obtain capacities and skills through learning from the dam and others in the system. Major efforts are required when organising suitable calf- and cow-friendly dam-rearing systems, and farmer observations must be more careful because they take place in a group and therefore need to account for complex situations. In doing this, the farmer shows animals
respect, and treats them justly as part of the ethical alliance between animals and humans cohabiting on a farm. Farmers? trust in the capabilities of the animals ? such as the cow?s ability to look after the calf and the calf?s capability to live in a complex dairy system ? seems to partly break with some of the animal husbandry qualities that are often considered important when taking care of cows and calves in a system with early separation. ?Being in control? in new ways than previously was identified as a key for human learning in these systems as a part of the shifting focus when observing animals and spending time with cows and calves differently. In a cow calf contact system, the humans need relies to a higher degree on being able to observe and judge a complex situation than, for example, on giving the calves exactly the same amount of milk of a specific temperature at the same times every day.}

This review assessed limitations and opportunities of producing, processing, and using these novel ingredients in feed. The use of non-renewable resources and the effect on the environment of production and processing the feed ingredients are described. Protein concentration and amino acid quality of the feed ingredients are evaluated to understand their substitution potential compared with protein-rich soya bean and fishmeal.

        abstract = {Das Projekt ?Soziale Landwirtschaft auf Biobetrieben in Deutschland ? Phase 2? (Projekt 2810OE007) baute auf den Arbeiten und Ergebnissen des gleichnamigen Projekts 08OE223 auf. Ziele waren, die Netzwerkarbeit zur F{\"o}rderung Sozialer Landwirtschaftsbetriebe fortzuf{\"u}hren und zu vertiefen sowie die ?Deutsche Arbeitsgemeinschaft Soziale Landwirtschaft? auszugestalten und zu verstetigen.
Da es bislang noch keine Klientengruppen-{\"u}bergreifende Analyse oder Datenerhebung zur Sozialen Landwirtschaft auf Biobetrieben in Deutschland gab, wurde eine m{\"o}glichst umfassende ?Erhebung Sozialer Landwirtschaft auf Bioh{\"o}fen in Deutschland? mittels eines Fragebogens angestrebt. Erfasst werden sollten dabei auch solche Betriebe, die nicht Mitglied in Anbauverb{\"a}nden sind; auch konventionell wirtschaftende H{\"o}fe konnten an der Befragung teilnehmen. Der R{\"u}cklauf der gut 100 Frageb{\"o}gen wurde ausgewertet. Um dem Ziel der Netzwerkbildung gerecht zu werden, wurde nach einer Methode gesucht, die erhobenen Daten der einzelnen Einrichtungen m{\"o}glichst {\"u}bersichtlich und f{\"u}r alle Interessierten {\"o}ffentlich verf{\"u}gbar zu machen. Als geeignetes Mittel zur Umsetzung dieser Idee erwies sich die Einrichtung einer Datenbank mit einer dazugeh{\"o}rigen Eingabeseite und einer Abfragefunktion.
Eine Abfragefunktion, welche einzelne Daten aus der Datenbank nach verschiedenen Suchkriterien aufrufen l{\"a}sst, steht nun allen Interessierten im Internet unter dem Men{\"u}punkt ?Hofsuche? auf der Homepage www.soziale-landwirtschaft.de zur Verf{\"u}gung. Diese Hofsuche-Seite wurde seit Erstellung am 9. Juni 2011 zum Stand (21.12.2011) bereits 4608 mal von Interessierten aufgerufen und damit rege genutzt. F{\"u}r weiteren Informations- und Erfahrungsaustausch dient auf der Website dar{\"u}ber hinaus ein moderiertes Forum. Dieses kann Diskussionsgruppen bestimmter thematischer und/oder regionaler Netzwerke eine gute Plattform bieten, sowie die Vermittlung von MitarbeiterInnen, Lehrlingen, PraktikantInnen und Menschen der jeweiligen Zielgruppe zu den einzelnen Einrichtungen erleichtern.
Parallel wurden weitere elf innovative Hofbeispiele erfasst, dokumentiert und analysiert und in vorliegendem Bericht vorgestellt. Sie liefern weitere Gesichtpunkte f{\"u}r zur Einsch{\"a}tzung von Entwicklungsperspektiven und -hemmnissen Sozialer Landwirtschaft auf Biobetrieben in Deutschland.
Zentrale Aufgabe der zweiten Projektphase war der Aufbau und die Ausgestaltung der ?Deutschen Arbeitsgemeinschaft Soziale Landwirtschaft? (DASoL) und deren Verstetigung {\"u}ber den Projekt-Zeitrahmen hinaus. Hierzu wurden im M{\"a}rz und im Dezember 2011 zwei Strategieforen mit ExpertInnen in Kassel durchgef{\"u}hrt. Die Ausgestaltung der DASoL wurde als partizipativer Entwicklungsprozess gestaltet, indem Prozessverantwortliche identifiziert und bei der Koordination und der Umsetzung ihrer Anliegen unterst{\"u}tzt wurden. Regionale Netzwerke bildeten sich in den Bundesl{\"a}ndern Bayern und Th{\"u}ringen, weitere wurden bei der Durchf{\"u}hrung von Auftakttreffen unterst{\"u}tzt und begleitet. Im Rahmen einer Projektverl{\"a}ngerung wurden Erfolgsfaktoren f{\"u}r solche Netzwerke untersucht und herausgearbeitet.
{\"U}ber den Projektzeitraum hinaus sind weitere regionale und thematische Netzwerke in Planung und werden im ersten Halbjahr 2012 ihre Arbeit aufnehmen bzw. fortsetzen (Brandenburg, ?Harz und Heide?, Schleswig-Holstein, ?Soziale Sch{\"a}ferei?, Sachsen).},

In the development of sustainable rural landscapes, aspects and processes from the a-biotic or environmental sphere and from the ecological or bio-sphere, do play a most fundamental role. So they are of crucial importance in the selection of criteria needed for the assessment of sustainability. Processes taking part in the a-biotic compartments like soil, water and air, do indispensably influence relations in the bio-sphere realm of a landscape (living organisms and ecosystems) and vice versa. Actually, the whole biosphere depends on the conditions that the a-biotic sphere provides for. The other way round, living nature creates non-living nature as a product of its vital processes. Both spheres are subject to a wide range of interconnected complexes of physical, (bio)chemical and ecological processes, assimilation and dissimulation, anabolism and catabolism, growth, maturation and decline. They all are quite sensible to endogenous control and also to the systems? exogenous pollution, degradation, depletion and destruction, because the nature of these processes is very subtle and dynamic and moreover locally determined. These days, they are increasingly influenced by a number of deteriorating side effects of industrial and infra-structural activities on a global-level.

The sustainable management of landscapes, that obviously includes the prevention of the negative effects of human activities on specific elements of the a-biotic- and the bio-sphere, bio-topes or whole landscapes, requires careful and comprehensive planning and an attitude of good stewardship. Overall objectives of such a sustainable landscape management should include a clean, healthy environment and a bio-(genetic) diversity, which respects the valuable heritage of natural and cultural evolution. Here, with the word environment we refer to the a-biotic sphere: soil, water, air and energy, targeting at favourable conditions of the earth?s non-renewable resources. The biosphere is referred to as ecology, meaning all relevant biological and ecological relationships in space and in time.

It is important to realise that all elements of the environment and the biosphere have not only complicated interactions among themselves as such. The elements are also very dependent on the extent into and the way in which they are perceived by the people in charge of policy decision-making. In the social realm, as will be pointed out later on (see column 3 economy and column 4 sociology of Table 3.1), the existing differences between various actors and groups in getting access to decision-making are highly determinative for the kind of decisions taken. If experts or representatives are invited to participate in any decision-making process then the question is ?who decides on whom to be invited in or out?? The various (potential) actors or actor-groups may have a combination of different economic and power interests. Especially in the context of policy shifts, e.g. toward a more sustainable land use, the vested interests connected to the previous policies have to find and accept ways to accommodate. A crucial question within economics is ?which strategy is economic to whom??  The fairly usual and short term interest of relative smaller private groups has to be exchanged for the long term interest of larger and more communal groups. This requires another level of considerations with a rather ethical dimension, indicated as the cultural realm. Therein, the personal perceptions of the involved values are addressed as well as the explicit differences in paradigms and related value systems that make people prefer short term over and above long term or vice versa. For instance, the standard for clean water is not only determined in an indisputable scientific way. Examples of questions related to the standard for clean water are: ?how clean should the water be and of what substance (absence or ?x? concentration of ?y? substances)? and ?how clean should the water be for what kind of uses: human consumption, bathing, washing, or trout farming??  The same decisions have to de made for standards on the necessary diversity of plant and animal species in a valley, on top of a hill or on a south or a north exposed slope.

Aspects filtering in from the social and cultural realm should not be disregarded or even denied in the decision-making process of the environment and biosphere values and qualities. The setting of sustainable management standards can only be done in a satisfying way if the existence, the background and the future perspectives of such value-system related perceptions are explicitly addressed. Here, satisfying means: long time functioning and thus positively recognisable in the landscape in retrospective. (See the psychological aspects in section 3.2.3 and the anthropological aspects also in section 3.2.3.) In our study, the presence of experts who are familiar with the practices and ideas of organic agriculture was found to be very fruitful. They added experiences on possibilities to merge food production and nature production in not yet widely acknowledged ways. This once again stressed the importance of considering facts in their proper contexts.

Compliant to what has already been mentioned about the complex interactions between the a-biotic and the bio-sphere, is that targets, criteria and parameters mentioned in column 1 (environment) of Table 3.1 and resource conditions are thought to be respected and included in column 2 (ecology and biosphere) of Table 3.1. Subsequently, they will be included as basic requirements in the considerations made in column 3 (economy), column 4 (sociology), column 5 (psychology) and column 6 (psychology and physiognomy/cultural geography). All these targets, criteria and parameters are compliant to the idea that survival of the biosphere is a prerequisite for a sustainable human development.

The quality of the a-biotic biotic environment for sustainable landscape management is represented by the criteria for the a-biotic and biotic realm, viz.: environment and ecology. These two groups of criteria are presented below:

Environment
Resource conditions
1.1	Clean environment

1.2.2	Good food and fibre quality to match sufficient quantities
1.3	Regional carrying capacity
1.4	Economic and efficient use of resources
1.5	Sustainable, site-adapted and regionally specific production systems

        abstract = {The specifications and the high price of feed in organic farming require implementing forage fattening. Based on the principles of agroecology, we hypothesized that the livestock farming system performance (animal productivity, environment and level of inputs) would be improved by associating beef cattle and sheep, allowing better valorisation of forages and parasitism control for the sheep. Three suckler farming systems (cattle (CAT), sheep (SH), mixed sheep-cattle (MIX)) were managed for 5 years into separate farmlets in INRAE Herbipole experimental farm, in order to test this hypothesis and the feasibility of producing beef and sheep-meat with only grass in a context of permanent grassland at 1000-1,300 m asl. The results showed that MIX sheep took advantage of the association, with a lower use of concentrates and anthelmintics and a better lamb growth rate compared to SH. Despite a satisfactory degree of fatness, the carcass of young cattle were considered too light by the industry with poor price. The high need for conserved forages for beef fattening in winter, coupled with droughts, has generated additional costs through the purchase of hay.}

In this paper we evaluated the suitability of leguminous cover crop pollens to the predatory green lacewing Chrysoperla externa (Hagen). The predator is commonly found in coffee agroecosystems and the plant species tested were pigeon pea and sunn hemp, which are used in organic coffee systems. Newly emerged females and males of C. externa were reared on diets containing pollen of pigeon pea, sunn hemp, or castor bean, used as a control. The reproductive success of C. externa was evaluated when females fed the pollen species and when honey was added to the diets, to verify the predator need for an extra carbohydrate source. Similar intrinsic growth rates were found for females fed on pigeon pea pollen and on sunn hemp pollen but these rates increased significantly when honey was added to the diets. Females fed with pigeon pea pollen plus honey and with sunn hemp pollen plus honey had higher intrinsic growth rates than those fed with castor bean pollen plus honey. Females fed on castor bean pollen only or on honey only, did not oviposit. Leguminous pollen species were equally suitable for C. externa especially when they were complemented with honey. The results suggest that to successfully enhance predator effectiveness, organic coffee plantation should be diversified with plant providing pollen in combination with plant providing nectar.}

Among the ?old? Member States, the so-called EU-15, Spain, Italy, Germany and France were the countries with the biggest organic farming sectors, while Poland, the Czech Republic and Romania were the biggest among the ?new? Member States or EU-13. Per capita spending on organic products in Europe in 2012 was ?34.7, while total retail sales were around ?22.7 billion. And the future continues to look bright: experts estimate that the market will double by 2020 (Meredith, S., Willer, H., 2012).
But there are still a number of factors that could hold back this expected growth, not the least of which is the threat of contamination. In the EU, conventional food and feed containing GMOs have to be labelled, although Regulation 1829/2003 does allow for the adventitious and technically unavoidable presence of a GMO in a given ingredient, provided it remains below 0.9\%. By definition, organic products are free from genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The EU regulation for organic food and farming specifically states that ?GMOs and products produced from or by GMOs shall not be used as food, feed, processing aids, plant protection products, fertilisers, soil conditioners, seeds, vegetative propagating material, micro-organisms and animals in organic production? (European Community, 2007; article 9).}

These rules are a constraint for an organic production of beef based on the bull calves born in the organic dairy herds because of extra labor costs, expected lower growth rate, difficulties in raising bull calves outdoor, possibly lower meat quality and lack of sufficiently high organic premium payment for the carcass. Thus, the bull calves are sold for conventional fattening. The supply of organic beef from young cattle is concomitantly very limited. However, in order to obtain the necessary higher payment for beef from organic-raised young cattle, it is important that consumers like the beef from grass- and herb-fed young cattle.},

        abstract = {in the Massif Central. An organic suckler cattle farm network was set up in order to establish technical and economic references. In 2004, 22 farms were monitored (13 of which had been monitored since 2001). All of these farms are located in economically-depressed areas. One hundred percent of the fodder area is under grassland. Annual crops (cereals and a cereal/pulse mix) take up 13\% of the farm area and are used as livestock feed. The stocking rate (1 Livestock Unit/ha of fodder area) is 20\% lower on organic farms than on conventional farms. Organic farms use 33\% less concentrates per LU, and the meat production/LU is 16\% lower than for conventional farms. The poorly structured organic beef market forces organic farmers to sell most of their animals (mainly store animals, since fattened animals represent only 43\% of the animals sold) on the conventional market without getting premium prices. Since only fattened animals are sold on the organic market at a premium price, the average selling price (?/kg live-weight) of all the animals sold is only 12\% higher for organically-bred than for conventionally-bred animals. However, because of lower operational costs (-35\% for herd and fodder area costs), the bovine gross margin/LU is 3\% higher for OF than for conventionally-bred animals. The lower stocking rate leads to a lower gross product per hectare of farm area. Since this result is balanced by a very low level of operational costs (no chemical inputs), the economic efficiency of the OF system is higher than that of the conventional system. The farm income per worker is the same in both systems. The search for feed self-sufficiency at the farm scale is a crucial element in farm economics, but it is only possible on mixed-crop livestock farms where cropping is possible with adapted crop rotation. The grassland farms, which are the least self-sufficient and have to purchase all the concentrates needed, must sell all their animals on the organic market to get the premium price that will then enable them to buy the inputs not produced on the farm. },

        abstract = {In Vienna, consultants, organic farmers and green-minded consumers have developed a new concept of urban organic farming, called Selbsternte (`self-harvest'). Organic farmers prepare a plot of arable land (the Selbsternte plot) and sow or plant rows composed of 18-23 plant species. In mid-May the plots are divided into subplots that contain 2-6m of
every sown species and are rented to so-called self-harvesters for a period of about 136 days. In 2002 Selbsternte was being practiced at 15 plots in Vienna or in neighboring cities, represented by 861 subplots, with a total area of 68,740m2, and managed by 12 organic farmers for 861 registered self-harvesters. At the Roter Berg plot, experimental subplots were established to evaluate yields and the value of the harvested produce, and interviews were conducted with 27 self-harvesters, the eight Selbsternte farmers and one Selbsternte consultant. The experimental subplots were managed in two different ways, namely, `with low intensity' (LIS) and `with high intensity' (HIS; meaning additional harrowing, mulching and sowing of additional plants). At the LIS 24.2 h and at the HIS 38.9 h of work were invested over 51 days. Monetary investment was US\$184 for the LIS and US\$259 for the HIS subplots. The total harvest of fresh produce was: 163 kg/subplot for LIS and 208 kg/subplot for HIS subplots. The total value of the harvest at the HIS was US\$364 for conventional and US\$766 for organic prices. All self- arvesters saw the rental of a subplot and the work as an activity of leisure. More than half of the self-harvesters reported `trying something new' at their subplots. The most frequently mentioned innovation for them was growing an unknown species. Twenty-five self-harvesters sowed 54 different, additional plant species. The motivating factors in establishing Selbsternte plots, as reported by all the farmers, were, primarily, better relations with consumers and work diversifcation, and only then were economic factors a consideration. The contribution of Selbsternte to income varied at the farms, being between 0 and 30\% of the total farm income. As a main success factor, all of the farmers reported a close relationship between the self-harvesters and the farmers. Selbsternte subplots can be understood as small experimental stations where self-harvesters merge traditional horticultural techniques with urban ideas on permaculture, sustainable land use and participatory farming. Selbsternte has potential value for the improvement of urban agriculture, but also for the development of organic farming in general.},

        abstract = {During the present decade, Austria has experienced a dramatic increase in organic farming among those countries that comprise the European Union (EU). For example, in 1992, approximately 2,000 farms were practicing organic, ecological, or biodynamic farming methodes. By 1997 the number of certified organic farms plus those in transition from conventional farming had increased 10-fold to some 20,000 farms. This represents almost 9\% of the total farms in Austria and an area of 345,375 ha, or 10\% of the total cultivated farmland. The largest concentration of organic farms is in regions with a high proportion of alpine grassland or pastures. Approximately 50\% of the organic farms range in size from 5 to 15 ha. The strong organic movement in Austria can be attributed to a) government subsidies which provide incentives to organic farmers and b) widepread acceptance of organic products and their brand names by large food chains and supermarkets. More than 60\% of organic farmers are affiliated with associations and organizations that provide advisory and support services in marketing activities. Certification of organic farms and food processors is conducted by seven monitoring bodies according to EU regulations No. 2092/91, which guarantees legally-binding standards of food saftey and quality to EU consumers, and according to the Austian Alimentari Codex. Since January 1998, all monitoring/certifying bodies in Austria must verify accreditation according to rgulation European Norm 45011. The major supermarket chain offers a variety of organic dairy and meat products, as well as organic ice cream, pizza, vegetables, fruits, baby foods, and bread. The current domestic wholesale value of organic products arketed from Austria farms is approximately 170 million US\$ annually. Unfortunately, funding for support of scientific research and extension to enhance organic farming and marketing has not kept pace with the increasing number of organic farms and farmers. Additional funding is essential to ensure the sustainable development of the organic movement and the organic market. },

        abstract = {The present context of a compounded environmental, climate and socio-economic crisis points to a need for transitions towards a more resilient society. In short, resilience involves the capacity to cope with change through adaptation, continual development and renewal. Transitions to resilience are needed not least within the global food system, which has failed to meet core sustainability challenges in terms of reducing environmental, climate and social destruction. 
Organic food value chains are among the emerging alternatives to the hegemonic food system. However, there are few examples of such chains that have expanded substantially beyond their niches, without becoming incorporated into the mainstream food system. This paper discusses two cases of organic food value chains in Sweden: Ekol{\r a}dan, an organic box-scheme, and Upplandsbondens, a farmer owned cooperative selling organic meat. The study explores the internal and external challenges and opportunities for scaling up these mid-scale organic food chains. While the two case studies have followed different trajectories and have sprung from different contexts, they have both dealt with growth and crisis in more or less resilient ways. 
The first analysis shows that cross-scale resilience is crucial for the successful growth of the studied cases. This means there is a need for resilience on multiple scales, in terms of generational/professional regrowth, diversity, food citizenship, political support, and ethical/value shifts, as part of wider transitions towards resilience within the context of a hegemonic food system}

The time required for feeding a plant increases in proportion to the mass and the number of different stackable substrates, low substrate bulk density also increases the time requirement. Daily tours of inspection include process monitoring, silo and fermenter sampling. The required time depends on the distances covered, which increase with plant size. Maintenance work also increases with plant size. Feeding and plant management jobs account for the largest share of total working time requirement.},

By measuring physical and financial outputs, and changes in soil properties and weed populations, the trials described here aimed to compare the productivity and sustainability of different organically-managed crop rotations.

Partner institutions from the Tropics actively collaborated in the development of the manuals. The partners of the manual for the Arid and Semi-Arid Tropics are from Asia (India), Africa (Senegal and Tunisia) and Latin
America (Chile).
The training manuals contain case studies of organic farming systems, describe successful organic marketing initiatives and offer guidelines for the main crops of the Tropics. With the informative text, transparencies and
didactical recommendations the training manuals offer a resource basis for trainers with the idea of encouraging individual adaptation and further development of the material according to need. The training manuals are available on separate CDs in English, French and Spanish.
The training manuals were commissioned by IFOAM and funded through its program IFOAM-GROWING ORGANIC II (I-GO II). The Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) and the Swiss Import Promotion Programme (SIPPO) provided co-funding.},

Pigs
From a biological point of view, 100\% organic feeding (with focus on protein/essential amino acid supply) seems to be feasible.
It seems to be questionable whether the quantities and qualities of the required feeding stuffs are available at present and in the near future if only regional till EC-wide origin is aimed. (These views are also based on the previous of wp 1 and wp 2 discussions.)
100\% organic feeding will stress economy.
Poultry
Regarding the issue of supplying organic concentrates main findings were:
Protein from organically produced Spirulina algae can fully replace protein from traditional organic sources in broiler diets.
Refining of ingredients of plant origin enriching the relative content of Methionine seems to be a useful way to supply relevant protein sources for poultry, eg for sunflower seed expeller.
Insects meal (Hermetia illucens) up to 12 \% in the diet can replace soybean cake without any difference in egg production, feed conversion, health and taste of eggs.
Crushed mussel shells (particle size 10-20 mm) supplied in the litter on every day basis to layers affected neither birds? feather cover, nor other welfare parameters or production performance. Crushed mussel shells cannot fully replace dietary calcium as calcium source without impairing bone health and egg shell strength.}

Two long-term experiments were established with the aim of evaluating the agronomic and economic performance of organic stockless rotations. In total, four different rotations were evaluated at two sites in the south (Elm Farm Research Centre) and east (ADAS Terrington) of England. All of the rotations included either a one or two-year red clover green manure crop to provide nitrogen for subsequent crops and it was found that this was sufficient to support three or four years of arable cropping. Over a period of eleven years at EFRC and five years at ADAS Terrington, there was no evidence of a decline in crop yield, although there were significant year-to-year variations. Crop yields were generally equivalent to or greater than average organic yields. Levels of soil available P and K was maintained at both sites at non-limiting levels. Pest and diseases were not problematic, but perennial weeds posed the most significant problem.},

One of the key findings was that professionals who have increased OA knowledge are more likely to be positive towards the innovation, as well as being more likely to be negative towards biotechnology. Overall, views towards OA amongst professionals seem to be slowly changing, indicating that organics as a new ?scientific paradigm? may be becoming more accepted.}

Overfeeding of protein to correct amino acid levels leads to environmental pollution and underfeeding of amino acids can cause welfare problems such as cannibalism as well as poor growth and egg production. To test potential solutions, the OK-Net EcoFeed project is working with farmers and industry partners in 12 Innovation Groups in eight European countries. The Innovation Groups (IGs) first identified current gaps and barriers  which include gaps in knowledge of protein quality and amino acid content in all feedstuffs and a lack of knowledge about the specific nutritional requirements of animals managed in organic systems. Adequate and optimal storage of feedstuffs as well as a lack of land for growing crops were issues and poor collaboration with regional arable growers and feed companies were also seen as barriers. Organic regulations state that feed should be produced in the same region in which animals are kept, but the word ?region? has several meanings. IGs were therefore asked for their understanding of what was ?regional?. Farmers considered it to mean closer to the farm than advisors or feed companies who both accepted ?region? to be up to EU level for  difficult-to-source feed components. IGs have all identified potential solutions to be tested including like-for-like replacements for soya such as camelina, canola and sunflower; sprouting seeds to optimise protein and palatability; ?green protein? from grass/clover leys; on-farm processing of regionally-grown soya; silage from brewer?s yeast and straw; management methods for feeding silage; and the development of an annual ration plan using in-season forage and fodder. 
All IGs will produce videos and factsheets to be placed on the Organic Farm Knowledge platform: https://organic-farmknowledge.org}

In many ways, the classical agriculture department is a human construct developed for our convenience, and as such it scarcely represents an ecological structure operating on farms. To adequately delve into the mechanisms of crop/weed, crop/animal, product/market, and myriad other interactions involved in agriculture, it is essential that we draw on methods from the biophysical and social sciences to help us understand the human activity system that is farming. For more than a decade, we have led a week-long summer course that applies experiential and discovery learning to help students make sense of farm complexity. Students take responsibility for designing the inquiry, process information, and evaluate what they learn in the context of each farm. Team projects provide a measure of learning about farming systems, while individual reflection documents provide a place for self-evaluation and personal reflection. This course provides a bridge between farmer-based and academic knowledge, an integration of disciplines and methods, and a discovery process that builds student capacity to understand complexity and the dynamic nature of Midwest U.S. farms.}

        abstract = {Pea (Pisum sativum L.) is a valuable and healthy protein source for food and feed. In addition to the nutritional benefits, pea is an invaluable agro-ecological asset for sustainable cropping systems through positive effects on soil fertility and soil microbial diversity. The symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria allows pea and other legume crops to supply the soil with nitrogen and, therefore, to significantly reduce the application of external nitrogen fertilisers. Therefore, pea plays an important role especially in low-input farming systems. The growing market for plant- based protein supply is likely to promote pea cultivation in the near future. However, pea production is severely challenged by various soil-borne pathogens that form a Pea Root Rot Complex (PRRC) causing root-rot diseases. Despite considerable progress in resistance breeding against individual pathogens, current pea varieties lack resistance against multiple interacting pathogens. The overall goal of this thesis was to contribute to the understanding of resistance against root rot pathogen complexes in pea.
Chapter 1 gives an overview of the importance of pea as a future key player in agricultural systems and the food sector before introducing the pea root rot complex concept and its relevance for research on resistance. Furthermore, the most recent developments in molecular biology relevant for molecular plant breeding of pea are briefly summarised and an overview of quantitative real-time PCR relevant for research on microbial interactions in the pea root rot complex is given.
Chapter 2 reviews the current knowledge of resistance against root- rot pathogens in major grain legumes, highlights the importance of the host genotype in determining the composition of plant-associated microbial communities and how the root associated microbiome relates to plant health. In addition, major findings on the role of root exudation in disease susceptibility and resistance of grain legumes are summarised.
Finally, it delineates how this knowledge could be integrated in resistance breeding of grain legumes.
In Chapter 3, a resistance screening assay was established based on infested soil from an agricultural field that showed severe pea root rot pressure. This approach was chosen in order to account for the whole rhizosphere microbiome - including the naturally occuring pathogen complex - in the assessment of root rot resistance in pea. The initial ITS- amplicon sequencing of the fungal rhizosphere community of diseased pea roots grown in the infested soil showed a root community of evenly abundant fungal taxonomic units not dominated by a few taxa. This finding points at complex interactions within the PRRC. Two hundred and sixty-one pea cultivars, landraces and breeding lines were screened for resistance on the naturally infested field soil in a controlled conditions experiment. The screening system allowed for a reproducible assessment of disease parameters among the tested genotypes. Broad sense heritabilities on the infested soil were H2 = 0.89 for plant emergence, H2 = 0.43 for root rot index and H2 = 0.51 for relative shoot dry weight. The resistance ranking was verified in an on-farm experiment with nine pea genotypes in two field sites: The controlled conditions root rot index showed a significant correlation with the resistance ranking in the field site with high PRRC infestation (Spearman's {\ensuremath{\rho}} = 0.73, p = .03). The screening system offers a tool for selection at early stages of the plant development, and for the study of plant resistance in the light of complex plant-microbe interactions.
For Chapter 4, a subset of five resistant and three susceptible pea genotypes was selected based on the initial screening. In analogy to the previous experiment, a controlled conditions experiment was setup up in order to assess and validate resistance of the eight pea genotypes on four soils. Plant growth was significantly reduced on the three sick soils compared to the healthy soil. Despite the significantly different levels of disease pressure in the three infested soils (ANOVA: p {\ensuremath{<}} .001) and the strong genotype effect (p {\ensuremath{<}} .001), no significant soil {$\times$} genotype interaction (p {\ensuremath{<}} .342) was found for plant growth reduction. In addition to disease assessments, ten key microbial taxa (eight putative pea pathogens and two putative beneficials) were quantified in the roots by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Fusarium solani, F. oxysporum and Aphanomyces euteiches were the most abundant pathogens in diseased roots from the three sick soils. Further, various levels of the pathogens F. avenaceum, F. redolens, Rhizoctonia solani, D. pinodella and Pythium sp. as well as the potential antagonist Clonostachys rosea were quantified by qPCR. The contribution of individual pathogens to root rot and growth reduction differed among the three sick soils: F. solani and F. oxysporum showed significant correlations (Spearman correlations; p {\ensuremath{<}} 0.05) with root rot index and relative shoot dry weight in the two soils with the highest infestation level; A. euteiches showed significant relations with disease in two sick soils from Germany. The quantities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were negatively correlated with root rot index and positively correlated with relative shoot dry weight in all sick soils. Furthermore, the root microbial composition differed significantly among the pea genotypes (PERMANOVA; p {\ensuremath{<}} .0001) and the soils (p {\ensuremath{<}} .0001) and a significant pea genotype {$\times$} soil interaction was evidenced (p {\ensuremath{<}} .0001). In addition, resistant pea genotypes showed significantly lower F. solani and A. euteiches, and higher arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi abundance in the roots (Wilcoxon rank-sum test; p {\ensuremath{<}} .05). These results give insights into the complex interaction between key microorganisms of the PRRC and the plant, by pointing out potential key microorganisms in the root rot pathobiome. Further disentanglement of this complex and the validation of key microbial players can be harnessed by resistance breeding.
Chapter 5 reviews the experimental approaches and results from the previous chapters before discussing the major findings and implications for future research and resistance breeding. I also raise the question if and how knowledge about complex soil microorganisms-plant feedbacks can be incorporated in resistance screenings and breeding efforts to conclude that today we are at a point where information on microbial complexes could indeed assist resistance breeding. However, our current state of knowledge does not yet allow to design specific microbiome-enabled selection-tools. This last chapter will also give short outlooks and indicate possible future lines of research in the field of microbe-mediated plant resistance.},

        abstract = {In Sri Lanka the agricultural structure of smallholder production has changed with population growth and land reforms. In former days a farm family could life from the production of their home garden through subsistence farming and barter economy. Additional income was achieved by selling surplus products like spices on the local markets. Today living standards and life style have changed and monetary needs for housing, schooling, electricity, telephone, household goods and transport facilities are much higher. Many smallholders are involved in single cash crop cultivation and outside employment for income generation. Lack of available arable land and infrastructure are main reasons for the limited economical success of many smallholders in Sri Lanka. This study investigated whether the formation of farmer groups under patronage of an organisation and private company next to adoption of organic agriculture practices can be recommended as an economical viable and ecological sound alternative. Hence a survey was conducted in Kandy District of Sri Lanka, as well as field and laboratory experiments carried out in co-operation with the Tea Research Institute, Talawakele and the Post Graduate Institute of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya.
Data from 529 organic tea smallholders (TSHs) were collected between 1997 and 1999. From the findings the study describes the present situation of organic TSHs production systems in Kandy District, Sri Lanka organised under Bio Foods Ltd. Organic Tea and Spices and Gami Seva Sevana (GSS) a Non Governmental Organisation (NGO). Methods applied include taking of farm inventory, questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with farmers and key respondents, drawing of land sketches, evaluation of data records from respective organisations and engagement in post harvest processes (extension, processing, packing, export, inspection).
Results showed that 92 \% of the organic tea smallholders cultivated plots on former tea plantation land with an average size of 0.4 ha and a given agricultural structure. Mainly seedling tea was grown on steep slopes and 70 \% of the farmers cultivated less than 1000 bushes. In depth studies at 23 TSH sites revealed 77 plant species of economical value. For about 35 \% of the organic holdings animal production served as an additional source of income (milk, meat, drought power). Out of the whole calculated farm income 42 \% was generated from tea, 24 \% from fruit and spices and 16 \% from treacle, nuts, coffee and cacao. If dairy cows are present 18 \% of the farm income is generated from milk sales. Through contract farming with experienced organisations, as well as professional processing and marketing of tea as an exclusive organic product, the farmers obtained premium green leaf prices and a stable income. The stable income served as an incentive to improve the performance of agricultural standards. Here the support of a dedicated extension service brings beneficial inputs. Tea production of the investigated organic TSHs rose by 16 \% from 1998 until 2000. Including the marketing of organic fruit and spices there is a high potential for resource poor organic tea smallholders to overcome ecological and economical limitations.

Next to the evaluation of the production system, maintaining and improving soil fertility is a major issue for the level of production. Organic manuring is often restricted due to the unavailability of recommended organic materials in adequate quantities. Preparation of compost is time consuming and work intensive and without animal faeces less effective and accepted. The dissemination of biogas plants in the project area gave the incentive to carry out investigations regarding the use of bioslurry for organic tea cultivation. Hence field experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of organic amendments, namely bioslurry, goat compost and bokashi, on the establishment, growth and yield of tea (Camellia sinensis). Goat compost was made out of goat manure and the remaining materials from the roughage feed given to the goats. Bokashi is a special fermented fertilizer made according to a Japanese recipe (Ahmed, 1995) using soil (50 \%), chicken manure (30 \%), pressed rape seed oil cake (15 \%), rice bran (2-3 \%), charcoal (1 \%) and boiled livestock bone (about 1 \%). Cow and pig excreta passing through a biogas plant, undergoing an anaerobe digestion process for about 70 days are referred to as bioslurry. These three organic amendments at a rate of 3/48/63 t ha-1 year-1 DM were chosen for planting a new tea field. Growth assessments indicated higher plant growth rates of the bioslurry plots when compared with compost treatments. Nutrient balance of a mature tea field partly manured with bioslurry at a rate of 10 l plant-1 year-1 and 12 kg compost respectively showed that bioslurry in combination with mana grass mulch has the potential to add sufficient amounts of nutrients to the soil in order to replace nutrient loss through harvest material. However considering nutrient uptake for plant growth and volatile losses, especially of ammonia, bioslurry application has to be increased and a combination with compost application is recommended. 

Since organic agriculture plays a key role in maintaining soil fertility and biodiversity, protecting the environment and keeping social standards a model farm with organic tea cultivation as a cash crop was designed. Research findings and personal experiences were taken as a basis for a location specific model of plant production including fodder cultivation, SALT (Sloping Agriculture Land Techniques) hedges, animal husbandry and operation of a 4m3 biogas plant. As main cash crops about 3,000 tea plants are cultivated in a mixed cropping system with 50 pepper vines (Piper nigrum), 56 betel nut palms (Areca catechu) and 100 gliricidia trees (Gliricidia sepium). Remaining 148 plants are grown around the tea field, along the border and surrounding the house. From an average plant species richness of 41 per 0.47 ha with a total of 3,354 plants a monetary value of about 78,000 SL Rs (1998: 1,054 ?) per year from plant production was calculated. The total monetary value of cow and goat milk yield added up to approximately 20,000 SL Rs (1998: 270 ?) per year. Generated income from farming covers the costs of production. Initial investments for animals, stables and set up of a biogas plant have to be covered by savings and loans. Systematic conversion of smallholder lands with livestock integration becomes financially viable after three years.

Specialisation next to diversification ensures income generation and biodiversity as well as an improved nutritional diet for the farm family. Integration of SALT hedges for erosion control also serves as fodder and mulch material. Cultivation of fodder grass assures continuous fodder supply and cuts down walking hours for carrying fodder material from further distances. Proper use of the biogas plant reduces the need for firewood, increases soil fertility through the distribution of bioslurry and improves the sanitary situation.

In spite of favourable climatic and soil conditions, Sri Lanka is not self sufficient in its food crop production. Population growth, land fragmentation, ownership patterns, lack of infrastructure and erosion are main factors for low productivity causing land migration because of high rural poverty rates. Alternatives and different objectives of production are required for the survival of the existing population, to solve shortages of food and feed biomass and threats to sustainability. Organic practices use cheap and locally available resources. The productivity of agricultural systems can be improved in the absence of factors like mineral fertilizer, synthetic pesticides, improved seeds and access to credits over which farmers have little control. Organic agriculture techniques replace external inputs by ecological services and farmer?s management skills. This study investigated the status quo of an organic farming system. The interpretation of the survey results led to the design of a location specific model farm, where production goals were matched as close as possible to the resource base.

        abstract = {Grazing is an important aspect of the organic dairy production system and is considered the most effective means of reducing costs of milk production when managed properly. Grazing requires a well-adapted dairy cattle breed with high efficiency in converting energy intake to milk production. In organic dairy farming, it is essential to observe the behavioural and physiological changes of cows as early as possible to ensure better health, welfare, and productivity. The objective of the current study was to investigate whether the differences in grazing behaviour exist between Jersey (Jer) and Holstein Friesian (HF) cows under pasture-based management systems. The behavioural activities of 62 lactating dairy cows (36 HF and 26 Jersey cows) at Zegveld research unit, was recorded by the ear tag microchip, sensOor (AGIS, Automatisering) and the SmartTag neck sensor (NEDAP, The Netherlands) from April to October 2016. The activities recorded by sensOor included eating/grazing
and rumination while the NEDAP recorded eating/grazing and standing indoors and on pastures, respectively. Furthermore, the current study included two grazing systems kurzrasenweide (KR) and strip grazing (SG) and two levels of degradable proteins (OEB+ and OEB-). The differences in dietary level were created by supplementing the cows with 6 kg of concentrates per day with either an OEB+/- value of -50 or +50 g/kg DM according to DVE/OEB2007 protein evaluation system for dairy cows. The hypothesis tested was Jersey cows perform better under grazing conditions as compared to the HF cows and also, supplementation with low degradable protein might have increased the time spent in grazing as compared to high degradable protein. The behavioural data and performance evaluation were coded and analysed by Genstat 18th edition and Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 23, respectively.
The mean BW, FPCM and daily NEL, required was significantly lower for Jersey cows as compared to HF in all experimental groups, throughout the experimental period (p-value {$\leq$}0.05). The NEDAP output shows significant differences in the time spent eating/grazing and standing indoors and on pastures. However, with an exception for rumination activities, the current version of sensOor was overestimating and unable to differentiate between eating concentrate/roughages indoors and grazing on pastures. Based on the sensOor output HF cows spent longer time in rumination as compared to Jersey cows throughout the experimental period. NEDAP output shows that Jersey cows spent longer time in standing, associated with their smaller body size and less energy requirements. Also, Jersey cows spent longer time eating/grazing as compared to HF, both indoor and outdoor, associated with higher intake capacity per kg body weight. Unlike Jersey cows, the time spent grazing by the HF varied between the grazing systems. When cows were grazing in June and August, HF spent a short time grazing under SG as compared to KR system, which is associated with the quality of pastures. 
On the other hand, when cows were on pastures Jersey cows were not affected by changing the protein level in the diet, which influenced their consistency in percentage time spent on grazing in both KR and SG systems. However, HF were affected by reducing the protein level in diet, associated with their higher energy requirements for maintenance and production. The persistence of Jersey cows under low protein levels and the higher efficiency in grazing provides an opportunity for reducing the costs of production and feed-food competition for cereals, required for human and monogastric animals. The use of sensor technology could be an early warning tool in monitoring the behavioural activities of cows. However, further improvement of the sensOor is required to avoid overestimation of behaviour activities and to differentiate between eating and grazing. The use of sensor technology might be useful to both farmers and researchers in reducing the time spent on monitoring behavioural activities of individual cows.},

          series = {SJFI report},
            year = {1998},
          author = {Els Wynen},
             url = {https://orgprints.org/id/eprint/3061/},
        abstract = {To assess the effects of a hypothetical widespread adoption of organic practices in Denmark, a four-region, partial equilibrium model of the Danish agricultural sector, the Danish Organic Agriculture Project (DOAP), was constructed for the Danish Institute of Agricultural and Fisheries Economics (SJFI). DOAP contains 3 farm sectors, crops, dairy and pigs, and permits farmers to have up to 16 cropping activities. Detailed costs of production are modelled in each sector and region. DOAP contains two production structures, one conventional and one organic, currently representing less than 2 per cent of Danish farms. By exogenously specifying the number of farms using each method of production, the impact of a switch to organic methods on national outputs and farm returns can be estimated.

SJFI survey data indicate that conventional and organic dairy farms differ in their physical and financial structure. Most obviously, synthetic fertiliser and pesticide use is minimal on Danish organic farms. What is registered under this heading presumably falls into categories allowed by the national organic standards. The use of certain other inputs such as animal feed and labour is also lower on organic farms. Other input use, including manure and depreciation on machinery, is similar to that on conventional farms. On the output side yields on organic farms in Denmark are lower than those on conventional farms, and thus farmers require a greater land area if they are to maintain per farm production. To maintain a given livestock output, a greater area in fodder production is required. Farmers respond by reducing their production of non-feed crops, such as wheat. At present, organic producers also grow less sugar beets and grass for seed, rapeseed and green peas because of agronomic constraints in the absence of pesticides and because of an absence of organic markets.

Financial data indicate that existing organic dairy farmers can outperform conventional farmers. Lower production per hectare (through changes in yields and rotation) on the one hand, and lower production costs and higher output prices (mainly through premiums) on the other, result in favourable net farm income comparisons for farms under organic management. Estimates of organic crop and pig farms suggest a similar story, although yields there are lower and prices for the livestock enterprise are higher than on dairy farms. This performance is turned around over time, as premiums are estimated to fall with increased supply of organic products. This assumes that present conditions of marketing structures (for inputs and outputs) and technology are maintained at present levels.

The main conclusion from the analysis of the model results is that primary agricultural sector income may stay the same, or rise slightly if less than 25 per cent of Danish farmers across all sectors adopted organic methods, but that considerable losses could accrue if a high percentage of farmers followed this approach (see Figure 1). It must be stressed that this estimate is valid under present conditions of input and output prices, level of tech-nology, and estimates in the crop and pig sector and future values. The slight initial gains occur because, according to the latest (1995 and 1996) SJFI survey data in the dairy sector and estimates in the crop and pig sector, organic producers - especially in the dairy sector which comprises half of the total number of organic farmers - are making greater profits than their conventional counterparts. This result of higher net returns per hectare does not hold as more and more farmers convert, because the organic price premiums that currently exist would be substantially or wholly eroded. Considerations of increased knowledge over time in organic management, possibilities in technological change, changes in combination of enterprises, sector and farm size, and especially increased efficiencies in the marketing of organic produce are not properly accounted for here. They are likely to enhance the financial position of organic producers to some extent. If age per se influences financial results, the difference in age between organic and conventional farmers would overestimate the relative financial position of organic farmers. The limitations of the data in the crop and pig sectors call for some caution in interpreting the results. 

Using the model enabled several factors to be identified as key variables determining costs, production and net returns. The rotational constraints, the yield reductions, subsidies and the existence of the price premium on organic products are main factors. Changes in input prices were not modelled, except where the inputs are outputs (for example fodder crops) used in the livestock enterprise. An exogenous drop in output prices (as can be expected in the organic market) is found to be significant in decreasing the gap between organic and conventional farms at higher rates of conversion.

        abstract = {This work is a continuation of the investigation into the effects of the adoption of an organic farming regime in the uplands, on the dynamics of plant species and plant communities. The work comprises six vegetation trials: three investigating the differences between dynamics of organically and conventionally managed sub-units of each type of vegetation system on the unit (temporary ley, improved hill, semi-natural), two which investigated the effects of different UKROFS approved PK fertilisers on the composistion of improved hill and in-bye swards, and one which is investigating the effect of different sources of external nitrogen inputs on the composition of an in-bye sward.

The vegetation was monitored using 1m2 quadrats, surveyed either annually or beennially, depending on the dynamics of the system.  The vegetation data were used to quantify diferences in species abundance over time, and as inputs for a community level model.

The model used the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) as a reference point for comparison with the vegetation communities identified at Redesdale were placed in ordination space along with fixed positions of the NVC communities which typify these.  The temporaral movement in ordination space, of the Redesdale communities indicate the response of each management unit to the applied regime.

The NPK fertiliser trials finished in 1996 after 6 years, and the N trial is now in its third year.  Although in all trials the sward exhibits a very dynamic response to the environmnet, there have been no differences between treatments.

On the less dynaic improved hill and semi-natural (native hill) communities, analysis at both the quadrat-scale and community-scale has shown that the behaviour or organically managed sites appears to be the same as the parallel conventionally managed system.  This suggests that environmental and general management variables exert a greater influence on the dynamics of the system that differences between both management regiemes.  As monitoring has only taken place over a six year period, it is too early to say whether there are any differences in the dynamics of the semi-natural vegetation.  Of particular interest on the semi-natural vegetation trial is the increase (not significant) in cover of Calluna vulgaris on the heft where the stocking rate was reduced by 30\%.

The organic management system adopted at ADAS Redesdale, has aimed to elevate and maintain a high cover of Trifolium repens on the improved and intensively managed leys.  The quality of the organic in-bye swards has been consistently better in terms of raised Trifolium repens and reduced weed populations than in the conventional in-bye.  However, the dynamics of these swards appear too respond more to site specific environmental forcing variables than to a particular variant of management regime.},

Total protein yield in green juice was measured for three different cutting strategies (2, 15 3 and 4 cuts per season) in three different forage species mixtures. The forage species mixtures were given 16 three levels of sulfur fertilization (0, 30 and 60 kg S ha-1). Results indicated that the economic optimum 17 cutting strategy was 3 cuts per season (7 weeks between cuts) as this yielded same total protein yield as a 18 more frequent cutting strategy. The highest protein recovery was found among plant species with high 19 protein content and low dry matter content. The tested plants species from the Brassicaceae group all had 20 high protein recovery, whereas the grasses generally had low protein recovery. Within the leguminous 21 species Anthyllis vulneraria, Trifolium repens and Vicia villosa all had the highest protein recovery. The 22 amino acid profile in the green juice differed between species, harvest dates and sulfur fertilization regimes, 23 however the differences were minor. The most determine factor for the protein quality was the plant species.},

        abstract = {Low-input agriculture is dominant farming style in majority of the Central and East European  (CEE) countries. However, the shift from high-input agriculture as practised during the communist time to the present low-input farming was not the result of a designed policy for agricultural development but rather the consequence of a socio-political evolution from state economy to market economy. 

Ten years after the transition, the agricultural policies of most Central and East European countries are still at the ?crossroad?. They are characterised by a diversity of visions on the further development and concepts how to implement these visions. The agri-environmental component of the current CEE?s agricultural policies either doesn?t exist or is rather vague and underdeveloped. Most of the CEE countries still aim at restoring agri-chemical inputs to the pre 1990 level. 

The low-input farming is not necessarily environmentally friendly since it often doesn?t pay sufficient attention to the environmental degradations caused by agricultural operations. This type of farming too can lead to severe soil erosion, declining biodiversity and building up of pests and diseases. Besides, the low-input farming is often not economically viable. 

To enable development of environmentally friendly agriculture in CEE countries, a three-track policy approach is suggested. Its measures should:
1.	improve environmental and economic performance of the current low-input agriculture;
2.	promote further development of pioneering organic agriculture, and
3.	convert the remaining high-external-input regime to integrated agriculture. 

A mix of policy instruments (regulative, economic, informative, institutional and voluntary) should be put in place to facilitate further development of this three-track policy.

The calculation from a recently finished Phare project in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania suggests that a tree-track policy approach make an interesting policy option both from the economic and environmental point of view. A share of as little as 30\% of improved low-input agriculture and organic agriculture in the total agricultural production results in gross national agricultural production values comparable to those obtained by the conventional scenario. However, when the external (environmental) costs of N-leaching are internalised into the price of the produce by charging a shadow price of ?1 per kg of nitrogen leached, the sustainable scenario showed even greater economic benefit. It resulted in net national agricultural production values of 5\% (Romania), 16\% (Bulgaria) and 40\% (Hungary) higher than by the conventional scenario. At the same time, the sustainable scenario exhibits substantially lower nitrogen leaching (45\% in Romania, 34\% in Bulgaria and 18\% in Hungary) as compared with the conventional scenario. This nutrient emission reduction complies quite well with the targets set for nutrient reduction for the Danube River and the Black Sea. 

Establishment of an international facility to support national teams in preparing and implementing the-three track policy would enable a concerted action in CEE countries. },

        abstract = {Introduction
Most agricultural operations, such as soil tillage, manuring, grazing, and irrigation, pose a serious threat to water quality. Agriculture is a heavy water user and a serious water polluter (nutrients, pesticides, salts, pathogens, heavy metals, oxygen-depleting and radioactive substances, etc.). In addition, agriculture threatens water habitats. The UN ?Convention for the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes? ratified at Helsinki in 1992 obliges the signatory countries to further prevent, control and reduce water pollution from point and non-point sources. The implementation of the Convention is co-ordinated by the UN Economic Commission for Europe. In October 1999, this organisation commissioned a study aimed at assessing the status of implementation of regulatory and policy instruments to protect European waters from the consequences of agricultural practices. 

Material and methods
The study (Znaor, 1999) involved nine European countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Great Britain, Hungary, Netherlands, Romania and Slovenia), as well as several regional (international) programmes, such as EU, Baltic Sea, Danube River Basin and the Black Sea programmes. The information needed to analyse the existing national and international policies and their implementation was obtained through a survey using a specially developed questionnaire. The answers were provided by a number of high governmental officials from the ministries of agriculture, environment and/or water management of the reviewed countries and the respected international organisations. The survey was complemented with information collected through a literature study. Because of its potential to reduce the water pollution caused by agricultural practices, the policy instruments to promote organic farming have been given special attention in the study. 

Results and discussion
The study showed that (i) although all surveyed countries have special legislation and policy instruments on protecting water from the consequences of agricultural practices, their implementation is unsatisfactory; (ii) thirteen out of fifteen EU countries failed in complying with the EU Nitrate Directive (in mid December 1999, only Denmark and Finland entirely complied with the Directive); (iii) only four out of nine countries surveyed have specific regulations and policies to support organic agriculture; (iv) the officials contacted assess organic farming to an agricultural method with the least pollution risk. The main obstacles for carrying out the above-mentioned convention are the weak institutional arrangements and the lack of appropriate policy instruments stimulating good agricultural practices. The convention is best implemented in the countries with both well-established national co-ordination between responsible ministries and operating subsidies for ?water-friendly? farming. The subsidies that are provided within the framework of the agri-environmental programme in the EU, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovenia are great tools in enhancing conversion to organic agriculture. 

Conclusions
The economic policy instruments were found to be most fundamental for change to organic farming. In order to encourage farmers (voluntarily) to participate in programs that minimise water pollution, the financial incentives for these programmes have to be as stimulating as other agricultural programmes designed to encourage high-input agriculture. The experience of several countries suggests that "green taxes" on fertilisers and pesticides higher than 100\% would have a better impact on conversion to organic farming than the combination of conversion subsidies and low "green taxes". This is because the "green taxes" affect 95-99\% of the farmer population, while the conversion subsidies offer incentives to a few farmers who belong to the group of pioneers and early adopters. Organic agriculture can be a great help for the EU countries in complying with the Nitrate Directive. A ?policy-led? development based on appropriate regulations and economic instruments are central to foster further expansion of organic agriculture throughout Europe.

        abstract = {Next to soil, water is the resource mostly threatened with agricultural practices. Agricultural pollutants (fertilizers, pesticides, silage effluent, organic manures and other farm wastes) enter the water through the run off, erosion, leaching and rarely by direct input. Studies from various parts of the world have shown that agriculture represents major, much more serious source of water pollution than any other sector (industry, transport, population, tourism, etc.) or sometimes all these sectors together. The same counts for Danube, and this has been confirmed by the recent Danube Environmental Integrated Study. The damage to priority functions of ground and surface water in the Danube basin (DB) and part of the north western shelf of the Black Sea is estimated at some 8 billion DEM/year.

More than a half of the territory of the Danube basin is used for agricultural activities and agriculture represents an important economic activity of the region. Except in Germany and Austria, farmers in all other Danube countries currently practice mostly low-input agriculture. This is due to the post-communistic economic transition resulting in price liberization and serious disproportion between change of producer, input and retail price of agricultural commodities. This situation resulted in reduced purchasing power and demand for agricultural commodities inducing a mere negative profit margins for farmers. Dramatic price increase of agricultural inputs (fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, fuels, etc.) also resulted in dramatic change in the use and production of pesticides and fertilizers which in some countries dropped by more than 70\% since 1989. Although from the environmental point of view this change is desirable, it inevitably resulted in declined agricultural output. Therefore advocating continuation of low-input farming in the DB, from the view point of an average "Danubian" seems to be nonsense. "Do you want us to starve?", and "contrary to Germany and Austria we don't use fertilizers and pesticides and our agriculture is already environmentally friendly" are the two most common and most frequent statements one hears about the issue. Indeed, travelling along the mid and lower Danube one can find hundreds of thousands of hectares being managed almost as century ago. Scenes with horse ploughing, hand sowing and weeding are reality again. Very little, or often no pesticides and fertilizers are used. And yields are very poor. Far too little to attribute the word "sustainable" to that type of agriculture. However an experienced eye can notice that besides poor yields, low-input agriculture as practised in the region, causes a number of environmental problems, too. Signs of ongoing erosion, over (or more often) undergrazing, lack of soil organic matter and bad soil structure, soil left bare after harvest, inappropriate manure storage and handling (often resulting in leaching) are only a few of these. Besides, narrow crop rotation or sometimes monoculture (e.g. maize, grain cereals, potatoes) apart from reducing soil fertility and building-up pest and diseases, has deuterating effect on overall biodiversity, too. In other words, present agriculture in DB, although low, or often "zero" input, is not sustainable neither from economic nor environmental point of view. 

Only a tiny part of DB farmers learnt the lesson: drastic reduce or complete refrain from agri-chemical inputs alone, without parallel steps in (re)designing eco system and its strengthening through biological processes is not sufficient. What does it mean? It means that "conventional agriculture  without inputs" unless complemented with better farm management is not an optimal form of low-input agriculture, and will never achieve production levels and environmental benefits as required by the concept of sustainable agriculture. This can be achieved only when low-input agriculture is encompassed with good farm management, wider crop rotation, proper land:animal ratio, careful soil cultivation, wise use of green and other organic manures, preventive and environmentally friendly curative plant protection measures, etc. Some DB farmers took this approach, and they are usually called "organic" or "ecological" farmers.

Organic agriculture is rapidly growing sector both in EU and DB, with the annual growth rate of 25-30\%. Reliable data on the area farmed organically in DB are scare, but it is estimated that some 1 million ha are currently being farmed according to the EU or similar (inter)national regulations on organic agriculture (table 1). However, organic farming is more popular in Germany and especially in Austria (16\% of total Austrian agriculture is organic), while in other DB countries it is still marginalized. 

Yields obtain under organic management, as well as net return indicate that this type of agriculture is fully competitive to the existing low-input agricultural practices in the basin. Besides, comparison studies with other farming systems show far less environmental degradation. Organic farms usually have better soil structure, more organic matter, better nutrient balance, less polluted soil and lower erosion rate. Further, organic farms show better energy efficiency and are also more diversified both at the level of crops/animals grown and the level of naturally occurring species and habitats. 

In some Danube countries organic products are certified and separately labelled and sold, sometimes also attracting 10 50\% higher price. This is especially true in CZ, H and SK where organic agriculture is far more developed than in other post communistic DB countries. While CZ has developed domestic market for organic produce, H and SK export most of their organic production ({\ensuremath{>}} 80\%). Research on organic farming is being carried at agricultural universities and research institutes in Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Moldova. 

Although the sustainable (organic) agriculture in DB has increasingly been under focus of various parties (e.g. UNDP round table on sustainable agriculture, several Avalon Foundation seminars, PHARE demonstration centres project, etc.), the issue is still not taken seriously enough. And all this in spite of clear indications that agriculture plays the key role in biodiversity, climate change, water pollution (the main polluter of the DB), and that it is at the same time most cost-effective sector when reduction/prevention of (water) pollution is in question. This ignorance is however, not only at the side of international organizations like UNDP, UNEP, FAO, EC, etc. and governments (both from DB and others), but what surprises, even at the side of well respected environmental organizations. Although the "Gro\_njan Declaration" (resulted from a workshop organized by Avalon Foundation) which appeals for further recognition of organic agriculture in the region as it is "one of the most ecologically, socially, economically and culturally appropriate forms of agriculture for Europe" was co-signed by organizations like EURONATUR (European Natural Heritage Fund), WWF (World Wilde Fund for Nature), Birdlife International, IUCN (The World Conservation Union) and Greenpeace- these organizations their concern about, and care for nature conservation and biodiversity translate into support for nature parks and not for sustainable agriculture yet. The same counts for REC (Regional Environmental Centre- Budapest) which when compared with other fields, awarded far too little grants in the field of sustainable agriculture.  

Sustainable (organic) agriculture is also a very important part of the Strategic Action Plan for the Danube River Basin 1995 2005, and is positively addressed in the documents from the Pan European Ministerial Environmental Protection Conferences in Luzerne, and especially in Sofia. Governments policy however is still almost entirely focusing on reaching the former output levels through restoring of the former high input approaches via re organised cooperatives or a small number of big private farms. But Danube countries (and apparently CEE in general) are going through a "forced" experience with low-input agriculture. Forced in the sense that it was not desired policy for agricultural development but was a consequence of a politically dominant process of evolution from state economy to market economy. Policy makers can chose for different strategies to support the development of organic agriculture. These can include a whole range of actions, consisting both from the deterring (regulations, "green taxes", penalties, etc.) and stimulating measures (subsidies, education, research, publications, building public awareness and institutional structures, etc.). Every DB country can devote 1-2\% of its total agricultural budget to sustainable (organic) agriculture, as well as international funding programmes. But the fact that this is not happening, and that potentials of agriculture towards solving urgent environmental problems of the Basin are neglected, lead towards one of two following conclusions. Either policy makers from the region and international organizations because of insufficient information don't know exactly how to put agriculture on a more sustainable track, or there are other prevailing interests preventing cheap, but "beginning of the pipe" environmental actions. As long as there is no answer on this question and concrete projects demonstrating good will to change the current neglectance of contribution that sustainable types of agriculture can offer to cleaner DB, we cannot even think about having "Sch{\"o}ne Blau Donau" again.

In other words, it is expected that in the near future only technologies which care about environmental aspects will be promoted and accepted by policy makers, scientists, consumers, and society in general. This is not surprising since the environmental problems are among the most urgent ones our civilization will have to tackle and solve. This demand for more careful stewardship of environment is also acknowledged by philosophy of sustainable development - a widely recognized concept and necessity of future development. 

Although established at the very beginning of this century, ecological types of agriculture (often also referred as organic or biological types of agriculture) have for long time remained on the margin of the agricultural development. This is not surprising since the last decades were the "golden ages" of conventional agriculture which achieved enormous success in many respects. However, this success was based on specialized production characterised by high external inputs and intensive chemical and energy use, which has at the same time caused substantial environmental degradations. At the other side, ecological types of agriculture have from its beginning payed respectable attention to environmental aspects of agricultural production. How to realize agricultural production trying at the same time to avoid and/or reduce environmental degradations, protecting soil, water and organisms living in agro-eco systems, as well as how to produce sufficient quantities of high quality foods are top priorities in ecological farming. These attributes, next to the minimization of external inputs and non-renewable resources show that ecological types of agriculture among others also comply with the recommendations of Chapter 14 of Agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment \& Development (UNCED).

Today, ecological farming practice has technical solutions for most of the problems arising during the production, and it is estimated that some 1 million ha in EU, and some 70.000 ha in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) are currently being farmed according to the EU or similar (inter)national regulations on ecological agriculture, with the average annual growth rate of 25-35\%. However, it must be stressed that ecological farming can be fully successful even on larger scales, but under the condition that the compliant socio-economic and political levels of society are willing to support its implementation. This paper tries to cast some more light on certain aspects and performances of this type of agricultural production. Among these, a special
attention is paid to the:
a) feasibility of ecological farming in EU and in CEE;
b) contribution ecological farming can offer concerning environmental, especially water protection;
c) recent important international and national documents, meetings and policy measures supporting sustainable development in general and environmental protection and ecological agriculture as its components in particular.

Additionally, it is also hoped that this paper can serve as a contribution towards an open and constructive dialogue concerning the possible options of sustainable (agricultural) development.},

While classical research focuses to problem solving, design is a problem- prevention methodology, and is suitable for multi- and and interdisciplinary research teams with the vision of how to improve the agricultural sustainability. Since organic agriculture is based on the holistic approach and is also problem-prevention oriented in that it refrains from certain inputs and practices, design is an interesting methodology that could be applied more often in organic agriculture. 

1. Introduction, the need to redesign agricultural systems
The demand for a more careful stewardship of a-biotic and biotic resources is central to the philosophy of sustainable development. A widely recognised concept, sustainable development is an essential element in future development. Agriculture plays a vital role in the concept of sustainable development. Without sustainable agriculture, no sustainable development is possible. Agriculture related problems such as environmental pollution of soil, water and air; resource depletion and nature degradation; as well as socio-economic problems are high at the agenda of various communities and interest groups (including those of farmers, environmentalists, nature-conservators, scientists, consumers and policy makers. This has resulted in the serious demand that today?s farming systems be redesigned and transformed into more sustainable ones. However, this is not an easy task, because agriculture is a multifunctional and multiple objective activity (Goewie, 1997; Vereijken, 1995). Agriculture has to supply food in sufficient quantity and quality and the supply itself must be stable, sustainable and accessible. It must provide employment and generate basic income and profit at farm, regional level and national levels. In addition, agriculture also has to try and avoid and minimise the pollution of a-biotic resources, protect and steward nature and landscape, as well as ensure the overall health and well-being of farm animals and rural and urban people (Vereijken, 1995). 

2. Desired improvements of farming systems and the measurement of their sustainability 
Taking into account agriculture-related problems, the following improvements seem to be desirable in order to make farming systems more sustainable: 
1)	?ecologisation?: prevention and/or minimisation of environmental pollution through the overall management and the use of agricultural inputs; 
2)	production of more ?nature? and (bio)diversity on farms;
3)	ensure stable and fair income for farmers allowing them to maintain their dignity and function in society;
4)	a higher degree of ethical and political acceptability;
5)	in non-EU regions such as Central and Eastern Europe overall farm management and yields should be improved.
A farming system should be designed and function in a way that complies as far as possible with the requirements, criteria and parameters of sustainable agriculture (van Mansvelt and Znaor, forthcoming). However, the above mentioned functions and objectives of agriculture are not necessarily always compatible. Sometimes they conflict as in the case of economy and nature protection (Goewie, 1997). Besides, each farm is an agro-ecological and socio-economic entity, operating under specific conditions, which makes it impossible to impose a set of uniform sustainability criteria because sustainability is both site-specific and determined by macro institutional and economic settings. Therefore, in practice no farm entirely fulfills all the requirements for sustainable agriculture, even if these have been theoretically determined. The overall sustainability of a farming system can best be expressed by the index (degree) of sustainability reached. This index can be derived from farm balances such as nutrients, soil organic matter, energy, labour, economic return, resource use and biodiversity value, and from other relevant farm data (Znaor, 1996).

3. Methodology of designing sustainable farming systems
Design is not a typical research methodology. In fact it is a process very different from classical research. Classical research investigates a particular problem, phenomena or a set of problems, in order to understand the mechanisms involved. Sometimes it seeks answers to practical problems. In most cases, a research problem or object is segregated into smaller ?researchable? units, and analysis and experiments are performed to prove causal relations between manipulation and phenomena (Goewie, 1997). Design, however, involves another process entirely. In design one synthesises the knowledge into the larger units through which the ?whole? functions in reality. In other words, in research one ?discovers something?, while in designing one ?creates something? out of its vision and synthesised knowledge. However, although design takes another route than the one followed in research, it does not exclude the need for classical research, since designing is enriched by each new research discovery. Agro-designing methodology involves several steps (Vereijken, 1995). It starts with an inventory of the needs and objectives of the stakeholders concerned. Objectives are then ordered hierarchical and rated. The most important of these are then transformed into a suitable set of parameters. In other words, in order to quantify selected objectives, a set of measurable key parameters should be developed. The next step is to establish appropriate agricultural methods and techniques serving more than one objective, - for example, intensive fertilisation serves in general the objective of high yield and is detrimental to other objectives such as the environment - and capable of bridging gaps between conflicting objectives. Finally, the set of multi-objective parameters and methods is linked in a general theoretical prototype based on agronomic, agro-ecological and economic considerations. Theoretical prototypes are then tested in practice and their shortcomings are used as the learning points for the next phase (re)designing of the same or another farming system.

        abstract = {In the period 2002-2004, the Netherlands Government's Pin-Matra programme funded an international project aiming to support the introduction of an agri-environment programme (AE) in Croatia. The project resulted in proposals for national and pilot agri-environment programmes. The project addressed key actors working on agri-environmental issues in Croatia, such as government representatives, scientists, farmers, environmental and nature conservation NGOs.

An AE Programme has been operating in the EU since 1992. Today it is the only obligatory measure under the EU Rural Development Regulation. The costs of the AE programmes are part-financed from the EU budget and partly from national budgets. The programme is based on voluntary agreements between farmers and public authorities and currently covers some 25\% of agricultural land in the EU. The AE schemes have become an important policy instrument for protecting the environment and maintaining biodiversity on EU agricultural land. 

At present Croatia still does not have the appropriate legislative framework needed to facilitate an AE programme. However, Croatia has been working to improve this situation: a Code of Good Agricultural Practices and a National Programme for Agriculture and Rural Areas are soon to be adopted. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management runs a comprehensive agricultural support scheme for farmers. However, 98\% of this budget is devoted to production-linked direct payments, while support for rural development is limited to only 0.4\% of the total agricultural aid budget. Except for subsidies for organic farming and local breeds, currently there are no other financial provisions for environmentally friendly farming in Croatia. Responsibility for environmental and nature protection in Croatia is divided between three ministries: the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management; the Ministry of Environmental Protection, Spatial Planning and Construction; and the Ministry of Culture (nature protection). There are a number of opportunities for the introduction of an agri-environment programme in Croatia, notably the political climate and Croatia's aspirations to join the EU. However, there are also some obstacles. A particular problem is the high level of the current direct payments. In order to be attractive enough, the AE subsidies would have to be high as well.  

The Croatian agricultural sector has two parallel production systems: private family farms and agricultural companies. Private farming constitutes the core of the agricultural sector of Croatia. The recent agricultural census, satellite images and the Ministry of Agriculture's Farm Register indicate that the agricultural area utilised in Croatia is nearly three times smaller than the agricultural area recorded in official statistics. According to these figures, Croatia has only 0.18 ha of arable land per capita, which puts it in the group of countries with a critical land per capita ratio. This is also one of the reasons why Croatia is a great food importer and is self-sufficient in only five agricultural products. 

Agriculture is by far the biggest single influence on the Croatian environment and  countryside. Croatia practices bipolar agriculture: high-input in regions with intensive arable farming and low-input farming in less favoured areas, most of which are karst regions. The environmental impact of Croatian agriculture is much greater than usually believed. Croatia is a heavy user of mineral fertilisers and pesticides. With an average consumption of 260 kg of nutrients and 4.1 kg of pesticide active ingredients per ha of arable land in the last five years, Croatia significantly exceeds the EU average. Agri-chemicals are applied only on arable land and permanent crops. Most Croatian farms practice very narrow crop rotation, resulting in a number of environmental problems and a decline in biodiversity. Soil erosion is a significant problem, although the biggest one seems to be land abandonment. Shrubs and forest-like vegetation are rapidly invading a vast area of Croatian agricultural land, notably species-rich grassland.  

The Croatian AE programme is designed to contribute to environmental and nature protection and the countryside. It will encourage farmers to continue practising environmentally friendly measures or introduce those that are not economically attractive, but essential from the environmental and biodiversity point of view. In this respect, the Programme is an instrument through which Croatian society rewards farmers for the public goods and services they provide (clean water and air, fertile soil, rich biodiversity, appealing landscape, etc.). Through the AE payments, Croatian society would reward farmers for the public goods and services they provide, as the value of this is not recognised by the market.
 
The Agri-Environment Programme has been designed to respond to two major problems that Croatia faces concerning agriculture, and environmental and nature protection: a rapid decline in (grassland) biodiversity and environmental degradation caused by inappropriate agricultural practices. 

The AE Programme consists of six schemes: 
1. The Information Transfer Scheme 
It should provide training to farmers, administrators and extensionists, as well as inform general public on the Programme importance.
2. Abandoned Land Clearance Scheme 
This Scheme should enable farmers to clean and restore agricultural land overgrown by shrubs.
3. Arable Land Scheme
It facilitates reduction of environmental pressure caused by intensive arable farming. The Scheme consists of the following packages: crop rotation, undersowing, anti-erosion and field strips package. 
4. Organic Farming Scheme
This should protect soil, water, air and biodiversity by increasing the area under organic management.
5. Grassland Scheme
It encourages farmers to continue with traditional (extensive) grassland management. The Scheme has two packages: for grassland management and species-rich grasslands- and provides payments for mowing and grazing.  
6. Biodiversity Scheme
This consists of five packages: the Meadow Orchards Package; Local Breeds and Traditional Varieties Package; Countryside Stewardship Package; Wild Species Protection and Carp Fish Ponds Package. These are targeted to improve habitat, species and landscape biodiversity.
Most of the proposed packages are horizontal measures and can be practised in all regions. However, the Species-Rich Grassland, Wild Species Protection and Carp Fish Ponds Packages are site-specific and can be applied only in selected areas.  

Only farms that are bigger than 3 hectares and inscribed in the Farm Register should be eligible for support under the AE Programme. These farms manage 87\% of the Croatian UAA. The only exceptions are farms in protected natural areas and organic farms, whose size can be smaller. It is estimated that some 2-10\% of arable land and 20\% of grassland would take part in the Programme, while the target for organic agriculture is 3\% of the UAA. The Biodiversity Scheme is hopped to occupy 23,000 hectares, involve 2.5\% of all livestock units and provide 175 km under linear habitats. The envisaged cost for the first three years of the AE Programme's implementation is 23 million EUR per year on average, representing some 7\% of the current budget for the state's support for agriculture. Once Croatia joins the EU, the AE Programme could be 85\% financed by the EU and 15\% by the national agricultural budget. 

Reaching the targets set out by this Programme would enhance the rural landscape, protect the environment, improve biodiversity and maintain Croatia's rich natural heritage. Therefore, this Programme should be given a prominent place when designing Croatia?s future agricultural policy.

        abstract = {Several studies from the mid-nineties pointed to agriculture as the single biggest nutrient polluter of the surface water in the Danube River Basin (Haskoning, 1994). Following these findings, the EU Phare programme awarded in 1995 a four-year education and research project aimed at introducing and assessing feasibility of organic agriculture in three Danube River countries: Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania. So far it is the biggest and most elaborate project on organic agriculture ever implemented in these three countries. The project consisted of a spectrum of training, on-farm demonstration and research/study activities, and prepared strategy papers for policy redesigning. The studies and research performed assessed the impact of organic agriculture on (i) water quality; (ii) biodiversity; (iii) regional markets, and (iv) macro-economic feasibility. In order to comply with the highly demanding project terms of reference and its complexity, an international consortium led by ETC Netherlands (consultancy specialised in sustainable types of agriculture) was formed. The consortium involved partners from Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Netherlands, Romania and United Kingdom. This paper is an attempt to summarise the most important findings of the research performed within the framework of this project. However, the diversity of the research topics as well as the limited size of the paper doesn?t allow very elaborated presentation of the results. Therefore this paper outlines only the most essential research findings.   

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:
Water quality
The results obtained show considerable variations between the three countries, as well as among the organic and conventional variants. A true comparison of the country results is not possible, since due to the differences in soil types and research organisation, the three countries were forced to apply different monitoring system. In Hungary, the total amount of seepage water fluctuated over the years. In 1997 there was no significant difference between organic and conventional arable plots, while the organic horticulture plot had some 31\% less seepage water than the conventional one. In 1998, the organic arable plot produced 22\% less seepage water than the conventional vegetables. However, this was not the case with organic vegetables plot: in 1998 it produced 24\% more seepage water than the conventional plot. In 1997 the nitrogen concentration in the soil solution of the organic arable plots was most of the time below 25 mg NO3 l-1, and always below 50 mg NO3 l-1. However, neither organic nor conventional vegetable plots were able to reduce the nitrogen concentration below 60 mg NO3 l-1, and the conventional plot exhibited figures as high as 185 mg NO3 l-1 (sandy soil). In 1998, only the organic arable plot maintained in early spring (and before manuring) the nitrogen concentration below 50 mg NO3 l-1. All other variants exhibited very high nitrogen concentrations, with conventional vegetable plot resulting in figures as high as 265 mg NO3 l-1. The Hungarian results show that the nitrate-N in vegetable plots (both organic and conventional) was much higher than in arable plots, which is due to higher level of nutrients applied, intensive soil cultivation and row cultivation. Contrary to the sandy soil in Hungary, the trial at the loamy soil in Bulgaria gave quite different figures. In the arable plots, organic treatment resulted in nitrate concentrations below 20 mg NO3 l-1 in all soil depths through the year, while the conventional treatment recorded concentrations of 40-60 NO3 l-1. Similar results were obtained from the plots under perennial grassland: the nitrate concentration under organic management was below 20 mg NO3 l-1 throughout the year, while the concentration in the conventional plot amounted to 110 mg NO3 l-1 in spring and 75 mg NO3 l-1 in winter. In Romania the total amount of water transferred from the soil profile to the groundwater (calculated from the difference between cumulated drained water and the cumulated upward flux by capillary rise) was higher in conventional plots than in organic ones. This was due to a lower soil bulk density, a greater water retention and deeper root penetration in the organic plots. A more elaborated information on the results obtained can be found in Hartl and Kromp (1999).

Biodiversity assessment
The biodiversity was found to be significantly higher (often 100\% more) in the organic plots both on weeds and fauna. In Hungary, the organic plots had 19-25 carabid sub species compared to 16-19 found in the conventional plots, while several carabid species occurred significantly more abundant under the organic treatment (Brachinus explodens, Carabus scabriusculus, Dolichus halensis and Harpalus rufipes). Spiders exhibited similar result to that of carabides. In Bulgaria, monitoring of beneficial insects in an orchard (Figure 1), and grain fields found organic treatment to be more favourable than the conventional and integrated ones. The assessment in barley found that earthworms occur significantly more abundant in the organic barley fields. In 1997, one cubic meter of the soil from organic plot contained 41 earthworms, compared to 18 at the conventional plot. In 1998 the difference was even more pronounced, with one cubic meter of organic barley soil harbouring 124 earthworms and conventional only 21. In Romania, the weed survey in maize fields showed a significantly higher biodiversity of weed species in organic maize fields compared to a herbicide-treated conventional one. Further, in Romania organic manure application was found to have a favouring effect on the soil mesofauna. Organic plots exhibited higher densities of total mesofauna as well as of collembolans and oribatid mites compared to the conventional plots. Gammasid mites, occurring only sporadically and with single species in the conventional fields, showed up in higher densities and 2-3 spp. in the organic soils. In Romania, too, the more spiders and Carabus individuals occurred in the organic treatment, as well as a moderately higher diversity of beetle species active on the soil surface.

The organic sector represents less than 0.5\% of agricultural production in the region. The share of organic market in the Czech Republic is estimated at 0.35\%, while in Poland it represents only 0.05\% of agricultural production. The organic market stagnates both in Poland and the Czech Republic, while Hungary exports most of its organic production and the market is under expansion. The majority of the organic farms in central and eastern Europe rely on direct marketing, and substantial part of the organic production is still sold through conventional distribution channels. The results obtained suggest that organic farmers in the region can produce for almost the same cost as conventional farmers. The price difference between organic and conventional products seems to be fairly small, with Polish organic market exhibiting somewhat higher differences. The price differences between countries were found to be smaller than differences within a country. The premium price is very small in the countryside, while in big cities consumers sometimes accept considerably higher prices. Cereals and dairy products tend to attract lower premium than other products, particularly fruits and vegetables. More information on the marketing study outcome can be found in Verschuur et al. 1998.

Macro-economic feasibility
The large-scale conversion study exhibited substantial macro-economic and environmental benefits of the ?sustainable scenario?. The calculation suggests that large-scale conversion to the sustainable scenario in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania would result in gross national agricultural production values comparable to those obtained by the conventional scenario. When the external (environmental) costs of N-leaching are internalised into the price of the produce, by charging a shadow price of 1 EURO per kg of nitrogen leached, the sustainable scenario showed even greater economic benefit. It resulted in higher net national agricultural production values (Romania 5\%; Bulgaria 16\% and Hungary 40\%) than in the conventional scenario. At the same time, the sustainable scenario resulted in substantially lower nitrogen leaching than that in the conventional scenario: 55\% in Romania, 66\% in Bulgaria and 82\% in Hungary. Since the study took into account exclusively the portion of nitrogen lost through leaching, which represents only 39\% of the total, the positive environmental impact of organic agriculture migh turn out to be even greater if losses occurring through direct discharge, erosion and run-off were added as well. 

CONCLUSIONS 
?	The study was too short to establish scientifically reliable results. Only two full seasons were monitored. Therefore the intention of the national research partners to continue this original type of research is laudable. However, the emerging results are in line with comparable research results in western Europe and the USA: in arable farming and pasture the N-leaching is lower under organic as compared to conventional; in horticulture, covering small land areas however, N-leaching tends to be higher in the initial stages of transition as a result of initially high manure dosages. Careful manure management is crucial indeed, both for environmental and for cost-saving reasons.
?	Preliminary results obtained suggest that the area under organic agriculture generally exhibits positive environmental effects in terms of reduced nutrient leaching, as horticulture covers relatively small percentages of the agricultural land. Leaching is critical on sandy soils under intensive production like in Hungary. In Bulgaria only leaching from organic land use remained below 25 mg NO3 l-1.
?	Bio-diversity benefits are demonstrated in all 3 countries for various beneficial species and in various crops. In the case of the longer term research in Bulgaria these results are more reliable already and indicate increasing positive effects of organic management on pest- and disease prevention in orchards.
?	The growing demand for organic food in western Europe could pull the market in central and eastern Europe, on the condition that certification is promoted and larger quantities of produce become available. The Hungarian tactics may be relevant for other countries as well: enhancing organic production via the export market with attractive prices, while creating a local demand in the meantime with slightly lower market prices. 
?	The macro-economic benefits of organic agriculture are very pronounced when the environmental costs of nitrogen leaching are internalised in the production value. This conclusion would justify policy incentives towards environmentally more sustainable agriculture.

The emerging results are in line with research results elsewhere. They indicate the potential of organic agriculture to positively contribute to environmental, biodiversity and macro-economic situation in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania. 

To enable development of sustainable agriculture in these countries, a 3-track policy is suggested. Its measures should improve environmental and economic performance of the current low-external-input agriculture; promote further development of pioneering organic agriculture; and convert high-external-input regime to integrated agriculture.},

        abstract = {Modern spring barley varieties have been developed with the aim of combining high productivity and standardised product quality under high-input conditions using pesticides for control of weeds, diseases and insects as well as heavy application of nutrient-rich and water-soluble inorganic fertilizers. In the organic growing system, biotic and abiotic stresses have to be overcome by growing the appropriate varieties and by practicing good farm management. The important spring barley traits to be considered in organic farming are related to the inherited viability and adaptation of plants to survive biotic and abiotic stresses and includes competitive ability (morphology, weed tolerance, growth rate, allelopathy), disease resistance (morphology, specific and non-specific resistance proporties, disease tolerance) and nutrient acquisition ability (root morphology, nutrient uptake and use efficiencies, low-nutrient tolerance, symbioses). An important question is whether modern spring barley varieties possess the right combinations of these characteristics to ensure a stable and acceptable yield of good quality when grown under different organic growing conditions. We know that varieties often perform and yield differently in different environments due to genotype-environment interactions, so it may be important to evaluate characteristics of varieties in organic as well as in conventional farming systems. However, it remains unclear to date whether the differences between the conventional and the organic growing systems are large enough to justify breeding and testing of varieties in both environments. Extensive field experiments and refined statistical methods are needed to clarify this. Characterisation of varieties as part of the official variety testing is at present done under conventional farming conditions in Denmark.

The aim of a newly started inter-institutional Danish research project within The Danish Research Center for Organic Farming (DARCOF) with project participants from The Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University, Danish Institute of Agricultural Sciences and Ris{\o} National Laboratory is to
Identify combinations of plant characteristics required for a barley crop to be successful in organic growing systems and develop methodologies for measuring these characteristics.
Evaluate, by investigating genotype-environment interactions, the need for specific variety trials for organic farming, and if necessary implement such trials.
Improve yield and yield stability in different organic farming systems by strategic use of the appropriate varieties and variety mixtures. 
Investigate the potential of different variety mixtures for reducing diseases and weeds and increasing nutrient uptake efficiency.  
Obtain new knowledge on plant competition, disease complexes, epidemiological models, nutrient acquisition and associations between molecular markers and agronomical traits.

The results of the first-year trials on three organic workshop areas and in two conventional fields with about 120 mostly modern varieties and a few variety mixtures will be discussed. The preliminary analyses indicate large variation in yield between the different varieties.
