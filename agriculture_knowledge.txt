igher demand for agricultural raw material is now anticipated and agriculture is not any more about 
producing farm products and selling them exclusively at the local market. Instead farmers today have 
a world market to serve. But the new chances bring new challenges. Farmers and agricultural enterprises, 
willing to be part of the new expanding world market, not only have to take into consideration customers’ 
preferences whom they want to serve, but also adhere to international trade regulations set by WTO and 
comply with high production and quality standards required by the importing countries.
Agriculture contributes around 17% to GDP and continues to be among the most important and success-
ful sectors in India. Around 58% of the Indian population depend on agriculture for their livelihood. Apart 
from delivering the local industries with top quality raw materials for processing, agriculture provides 
almost 10% of total export earnings. However, to support the impressive Indian economic growth in the 
coming years, agriculture will have to contribute more towards value addition, productivity enhancement, 
high quality products and trained manpower to successfully tackle these challenges.
The states of Gujarat and Maharashtra have competitive advantages for the production of several com-
modities. However, productivity and competitiveness remains low. Rising quality requirements of export 
and domestic markets require an up-scaling of the production which is only feasible with educated farmers 
and skilled workers.
Desai Fruits and Vegetables (DFV)in cooperation with the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale 
Zusammenarbeit(GIZ) GmbH on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (BMZ) takes up the existing education gap by implementing a development partnership 
called “Partnership Farming India”.
The goal of Partnership Farming India (PFI) is to enable farmers to be self-sufficient decision-makers, 
“agripreneurs”, which allows for a more flexible production system and highlights farming as profession by 
choice and not by inheritance. 
Furthermore, PFI strengthens farmers’ and farm workers’ management skills to adopt modern agricul-
tural practices and concepts and enhance the international competitiveness of smallholders’ agricultural 
produce by giving farmers and workers in Gujarat and Maharashtra access to practical agricultural educa-
tion. Therefore, DFV and GIZ in close cooperation with the National Institute of Agricultural Extension 
Management (MANAGE, an organization of Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India) developed the 
training material on basic agricultural knowledge and skills.
The states of Gujarat and Maharashtra will serve as an example on how to establish long term successful 
and trustful business relationships by combining small scale production in the field with large scale pro-
cessing and marketing. I am confident that this effort will serve the Indian agriculture as a replicable model 
make lasting contributions towards sustainable agriculture and prosperous farmers.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the people and institutions namely MANAGE, DFV and 
GIZ,which supported this project and enabled making information available. This is a useful source of in-
formation for farmers, trainers, and other interested persons to improve not only the agriculture but also 
the livelihood of the farming community.

Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
Preface
A
griculture is an important sector of Indian Economy as more than half of its population relies on Ag-
riculture as principle source of income.  Research and Extension systems play major role in generation 
and dissemination of Agricultural technologies aiming at enhancing the income of farmers. The extension 
system adopts series of extension methods such as Training, demonstration, exposure visit to transfer 
the technologies from lab to land. Majority of these extension efforts mainly focus on location and crop 
specific technologies, and mostly on solution to problem basis. However, there is a need for equipping the 
farmers with Basic knowledge of Agriculture in order to create a better knowledge platform at farmer level 
for taking appropriate farm management decisions and to absorb modern technologies.  
In view of this, Desai Fruits and Vegetables Pvt. Ltd. (DFV), India, in cooperation with the Deutsche 
Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH on behalf of the German Federal Ministry 
for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) in close cooperation with National Institute of Ag-
ricultural Extension Management (MANAGE- An Organization of Ministry of Agriculture, Government 
of India) brought out Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture to impart technical knowledge on Basic 
Agriculture to farmers to provide holistic perspective of scientific Agriculture.
This handbook is a product of series of brainstorming workshops and consultative meetings with various 
stakeholders such as Researchers, Academicians, Extension Functionaries, Agripreneurs, Master Trainers 
and Farmers. Based on the identified needs, the topics were prioritized and contents were developed with 
the help of experts. The farmer-friendly content has been written in simple language, using more pictures 
with practical examples for the benefit of farmers. 
The book contains six chapters, each focusing on a particular topic. The first chapter, “General conditions 
for cultivation of crops”, talks about the basic needs of farmers and farming sector, by providing basic 
knowledge on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), enhancing the awareness of farmers on critical factors 
in selection of crops and cropping patterns, judicious use of natural resources such as soil and water, and 
emphasizing the importance of mechanization in the field of agriculture.
The second chapter “Soil and Plant Nutrition” is aimed at increasing the awareness and understanding of 
farmers about soil, it’s structure, physical, chemical, biological properties, soil fertility and managing the 
soil fertility in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner. It also focuses on the need for 
soil testing, plant nutrition requirement, organic & inorganic fertilizers, and Integrated Nutrient Manage-
ment (INM) for efficient, economic and sustainable production of crops.
The third chapter of the book is about Pest Management, and focuses on enhancing the awareness of and 
understanding among farmers about the crop pests, diseases and weed management through Integrated 
Pest Management. It also aims at sensitizing farmers on safe handling of chemicals and plant protection 
equipments as also elaborated further in the fifth chapter on “Occupational health and safety of farmers”. 
It creates awareness about causes, preventive measures of health hazards, risks & fatalities in agriculture, 
and use of first aid in emergencies. It further includes safety tips and care to reduce the risk of injuries and 
fatalities while handling machineries and pesticides by farmers.
Time and resources management is an integral part of each and every activity, be it service sector, busi-
ness or day-to-day activities of life. Farming sector too has not remained untouched by it. Therefore, the 
fourth chapter of the book is devoted to “Farm Management”. It is to educate and equip the farmers to 
make proper plans, take appropriate decisions and also to take advantage of the improved technologies 
to increase production, assure food security for the family and market opportunities to increase income 
considering available resources, anticipated risks, including market fluctuations.
“Farmer’s access to services”, the last chapter of the book, aims at enhancing awareness among farmers 
about sources of extension, information and services, public and private extension services, agricultural 
credit, insurance and legal aspects through Information & Communication Technologies. The content is 
useful not only for farmers but also for other stakeholders involved in farm advisory services such as Agri 
input dealers, Agripreneurs, Kisan Call Centers and extension functionaries working at grass roots level. 
We trust that this Handbook will benefit maximum number of farmers to make farming economically and 
environmentally more sustainable.

gricultural Universities, Research Institutes, 
Krishi Vigyan Kendras have been generat-
ing ample technologies to improve the productiv-
ity and profitability of the farmers. How many of 
these technologies are reaching the farmers? Base-
line Situation Assessment conducted by Partner-
ship farming in India, in Gujarat and Maharashtra, 
clearly indicated that farmers with access to techni-
cal knowledge on agriculture realized better income 
compared to others. Fifty one percent of sample 
farmers who were part of partnership farming In-
dia had knowledge of soil testing compared to only 
28% of control group. Mulching and intercropping 
as a practice were not widely adopted by control 
group of farmers. They were less aware about other 
organic fertilizers. Fertigation as a method of appli-
cation of fertilizers was not widely practiced by con-
trol group. Farmers who accessed information from 
agricultural universities and magazines were less in 
number in the control group. The treatment farmers 
had an average yield of 35.65 tons and control farm-
ers had yield of 22.36 tons of banana per acre. The 
average net income of the treatment farmers was Rs 
93,822 and for the control farmers Rs.81,659. More 
than 85% of the farmers wanted basic education on 
agriculture and crop production and ready to pay 
for undergoing such basic education and training. 
There was a clear interest in the farmers to improve 
their skill and knowledge and they were ready to 
pay for the service.
The above study clearly indicates that the knowl-
edge gap is prevailing among farmers and those who 
have access to knowledge harvested better profits.
Increase in productivity and profitability can be 
achieved through:
• 
Blending practical knowledge with scientific 
technologies
• 
Efficient use of natural resources
• 
Adopting time specific management prac-
tices
• 
Giving priority for quality driven produc-
tion
• 
Adopting suitable farming systems 
• 
Adoption of location specific technology
• 
Market demand driven production 
• 
Adopting low cost and no cost technologies

F
armers need to answer all the above questions 
while making decisions for choosing a crop/ 
cropping pattern. During this decision making pro-
cess, farmer cross check the suitability of proposed 
crop/cropping systems with his existing resources 
and other conditions. Thereby, they justify choosing 
or rejecting a crop/cropping systems. This process 
enables the farmers to undertake a SWOT analysis 
internally which in turn guides them to take an ap-
propriate decision.
1.4. Climatic factors
Climate and agriculture
• 
Monsoon is a key source of water in agriculture
• 
Most of our rivers are seasonal fed by the mon-
soon; even irrigated agriculture depends on 
monsoon.
• 
Cropping pattern has evolved over years based 
on climate.
• 
Market forces influence cropping patterns in 
recent times. 
Climatic factors and crops 
• 
Rainfall drives water availability and deter-
mines sowing time (rainfed crops).
• 
Temperature drives crop growth, duration and 
influences milk production in animals. 
• 
Temperature and relative humidity influence 
pest and diseases incidence on crops, livestock 
and poultry.
• 
Wet and dry spells cause significant impact on 
standing crops, physiology, loss of economic 
products (e.g. fruit drop).
• 
Extreme events (e.g. high rainfall, floods, heat / 
cold wave, cyclone, hail, frost) cause enormous 
losses of standing crops, livestock and fisheries. 
Climate and seasons
• 
Rainy (June-September) season also known 
as Kharif, supports most of the rainfed crops 
(coarse cereals, pulses, oilseeds, etc.).
• 
Post-rainy (October-February) season also 
known as Rabi, supports the irrigated or stored 
moisture grown crops (wheat, mustard, chick-
pea, etc.).
• 
Summer season (March-May) supports short 
duration pulses and vegetables. 
• 
Rabi production is more assured, has a higher 
yield and reduces pest and disease related prob-
lems.
• 
Over time, with irrigation development, the 
contribution of Kharif is declining and Rabi is 
increasing.

Climate, cropping pattern and agricul-
tural production issues
• 
Cropping patterns based on climate and land 
capability are sustainable but market forces and 
farmers’ aspirations are forcing unsustainable 
systems.
• 
Farmers must innovate in producing more even 
from less endowed areas by adopting suitable 
technologies to cope with changing climate. 
• 
Climate change will likely to cause further 
problems in our crop production and is likely 
to become the most important environmental 
issue in the 21st century. 
Important agricultural related factors 
responsible for climate change
• 
Deforestation and forest degradation
• 
Burning of fuel and farm waste
• 
Water logged condition
• 
Excessive use of external input
• 
Large-scale conversion of land for non-agricul-
tural purpose
Impact of climate change in India
• 
Rainfall: No long-term trend noted. However, 
regional variations seen, increased summer 
rainfall and less number of rainy days.
• 
Temperature: About 0.6 ºC rise in surface tem-
perature during 100 years. Projected to increase 
3.5 to 5 ºC by 2100.
• 
Carbon dioxide: Increasing at the rate of 1.9 
ppm per year and expected to reach 550 ppm 
by 2050 and 700 ppm by 2100. 
• 
Extreme events: Increased frequency of heat 
wave, cold wave, droughts and floods observed 
during last decade.
• 
Rising sea level: Rise of 2.5 mm/year since 1950.
• 
Glaciers: Rapid melting of the glaciers in the 
Himalayas.
• 
Rainfall distribution: Shift in peak rainfall dis-
tribution also noticed in some parts of country.
Expected impact of climate change on 
agriculture
• 
Due to increase in temperature, crop may re-
quire more water.
• 
Yield may be reduced in cereal crops especially 
in Rabi; i.e. wheat.
Impact of Drought
Impact of Flood
Heat Wave on Maize
Cold wave damage to chana harvest

General Conditions for Cultivation of Crops
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
Change in pest and disease scenario 
due to climate change
• 
Due to increase in rainfall: Pests like bollworm, 
red hairy caterpillar and leaf spot diseases may 
increase.Due to increase in temperature: Suck-
ing pests such as mites and leaf miner may in-
crease.
• 
Due to variation in rainfall and temperature: 
Pest and diseases of crops to be altered because 
of more enhanced pathogen and vector devel-
opment, rapid pathogen transmission and in-
creased host susceptibility. Sometimes a minor 
pest may become a major pest.
• 
Agricultural biodiversity is also threatened by 
decreased rainfall and increased temperature, 
sea level rise and increased frequency and se-
verity of drought, cyclone and flood. Quality 
of farm products such as fruits, vegetables, tea, 
coffee, aromatic and medicinal plants may be 
affected.
Water
• 
Demand for irrigation to increase with in-
creased temperature and higher amount of 
evapo-transpiration. This may result in lower-
ing of groundwater table at some places.
• 
The melting of glaciers in the Himalayas will 
increase water availability in the Ganga, Brah-
maputra and their tributaries in the short-run 
but in the long-run the availability of water will 
decrease considerably.
• 
A significant increase in runoff is projected in 
the rainy season, however, may not be very ben-
eficial unless storage infrastructure could be 
vastly expanded. This extra water in the rainy 
season, on the other hand, may lead to increase 
in frequency and duration of floods.
• 
The water balance in different parts of India will 
be disturbed and the quality of ground water 
along costal track will be more affected due to 
intrusion of sea water.
Soil
• 
Organic matter content, which is already quite 
low in Indian soil, would become even lower. 
Quality of soil organic matter may be affected.
• 
Reduction in rate of decomposition and nutri-
ent supply.
• 
Increase in soil temperature may reduce Nitro-
gen availability due to volatilization and deni-
trification.
• 
Change in rainfall volume and frequency as 
well as wind may alter the severity, frequency 
and extent of soil erosion.
• 
Rise in sea level may lead to salt water entry in 
the coastal lands turning them less suitable for 
conventional agriculture.
Livestock
• 
Affect feed production and nutrition of live-
stock. Increased temperature would reduce di-
gestibility. Increased water scarcity would also 
decrease the food and fodder production.
• 
Major impacts on vector-borne diseases 
through expansion of vector populations dur-
ing rainy years, leading to large outbreaks of 
diseases.
• 
Increase water, shelter, and energy require-
ment of livestock for meeting projected milk 
demands.
• 
Climate change is likely to aggravate heat stress 
in dairy animals, adversely affecting their re-
productive performance.
Fishery
• 
Increased sea and river water temperature is 
likely to affect fish breeding, migration and har-
vest.
• 
Impacts of increased temperature and tropical 
cyclonic activity would affect capture, produc-
tion and marketing costs of the marine fish.

1.5. Soil and Water Conservation
S
oil and water are our precious heritage. Hence, 
it is obligatory on our part to protect and hand 
over these resources to further generations. It is 
estimated that about 50% of the cultivated area in 
India suffers from severe soil erosion and requires 
remedial measures. 
• 
Water resources are essential for increasing and 
stabilizing crop production.
• 
Wind erosion has been responsible for destroy-
ing the valuable top soil.
1.5.1. Degradation of soil and water 
takes place with water and wind ero-
sion
• 
The main cause of water erosion is unmanaged 
runoff.
• 
Runoff is the portion of the rainfall or irriga-
tion water applied which leaves a field either as 
surface or as subsurface flow.
Several factors are responsible for runoff 
• 
Climatic factors: Precipitation characteristics - 
duration, intensity, distribution, direction, tem-
perature, humidity, wind velocity.
• 
Watershed characteristics: Geological shape of 
the catchments, size and shape of the catch-
ments, topography, drainage pattern.
• 
Barren land without vegetation
• 
Soil types: 
• 
Sandy soil: Average rain – no problem of 
erosion. High intensity – More serious of 
less binding material i.e. fine soil particle.
• 
Clay soil: Ordinary rain – more runoff in 
moderate and steep slopes but high water 
holding capacity. 
• 
Silt loam, loamy and fine sandy loam: More 
desirable soils from the point of view of 
minimizing soil erosion.
How vegetation reduces runoff
• 
Interception of rainfall
• 
Root structure 
• 
Biological influences
• 
Transpiration effects
• 
Intercept, absorb the impact of raindrop
• 
Hindrance to runoff water slows down the rate 
at which travels down the slope
• 
Knitting and binding effect aggregates the soil 
into granules 
• 
Die and decay increase pore space and water 
holding capacity
• 
One cubic meter of soil has several kilometres 
of root fibre
• 
More vegetative cover, most active soil fauna, 
channels of earth worm, beetles and other life
• 
Vegetation increases the storage capacity of 
the soil for rainfall by the transpiration of large 
quantities of moistures from the soil
Soil erosion 
Soil erosion is the detachment and transportation 
of soil material from one place to another through 
the action of wind, water in motion or by the hitting 
action of the rain drops.
• 
When the vegetation is removed and land is 
put under cultivation the natural equilibrium 
between soil building and soil removal is dis-
turbed.
• 
The removal of surface soil takes place at a 
much faster rate than it can be built up by the 
soil forming process.
Erosion by water: Known as water erosion, is 
the removal of soil from the lands surface by water 
in motion.
Sheet erosion: The removal of a thin relatively 
uniform layer of soil particles by the action of rain-
fall and runoff.
• 
Extremely harmful
• 
Usually so slow that the farmer is not conscious 
of its existence
• 
Common on lands having a gentle uniform 
slope
• 
Results in the uniform removal of the cream of 
the top soil with every heavy rain
• 
Shallow top soil overlies a tight sub soil are most 
susceptible to sheet erosion
• 
Movement of soil by rain drop splash is the pri-
mary cause of sheet erosion
• 
Sheet erosion has damaged millions of hectares 
of slopping land throughout the India
Rill erosion is the removal of soil by running wa-
ter with the formation of shallow channels that can 
be smoothed out completely by normal cultivation.
• 
There is no sharp lines of demarcation where 
sheet erosion and rill erosion begins but rill 
erosion is more readily apparent than sheet ero-
sion.

General Conditions for Cultivation of Crops

• 
Rills develop when there is a concentration 
of runoff water which, if neglected, grow into 
large gullies.
• 
More serious in soils having a loose shallow top 
soil.
• 
Transition stage between sheet erosion and gul-
lying.
Gully erosion: Removal of soil by running wa-
ter with the formation of channels that cannot be 
smoothed out completely by cultivation.
• 
Advance stage of rill erosion.
• 
Any concentration of surface runoff is a poten-
tial source of gullying.
• 
Cattle paths, cart tracks, dead furrows, tillage 
furrows or other small depression down a slope 
favour concentration of flow.
• 
Unattended rills deepen and widen every year 
and begin to attain the form of gullies.
• 
Unattended gullies may result over a few years 
for an entire landscape to be filled with a net-
work of gullies.
• 
More spectacular than other type of erosions.
Stream channel erosion: Erosion caused by 
stream flow.
• 
Closely resembles rill erosion.
• 
Intensive channel erosion areas are on the 
outside of lands where flow shear stresses are 
high.	
Mass movement: Enmass movement of soil.
• 
Landslides, land slips, soil and mudflows are 
various forms of mass movement.
Wind erosion: Movement of soil particles is 
caused by wind force exerted against or parallel to 
surface of the ground.  
1.5.2. Conservation
Conservation is the utilization without wastage of 
resources is required to ensure a high level of pro-
duction.
Important soil conservation measures are
• 
Conservation Tillage 
• 
Minimum tillage
• 
Zero tillage
• 
Stubble mulching
• 
Trash farming
Sheet and Rill Erosion
Landslide 
Gully Erosion
Shelterbelts for Moderating microclimate

• 
Several practices are in use such as zero till-
age, minimum tillage and direct seeding.
• 
Planting crops in previously untilled soil by 
opening a narrow slot, trench or band only 
of sufficient width and depth to obtain seed 
coverage. No other soil tillage is done.
Advantages of zero tillage farming
• 
Erosion control: Retained stubble and crop 
residue reduces soil erosion and enhances 
soil fertility
• 
Moisture conservation: Stubble traps water, 
reduce runoff water, better infiltration lead-
ing to improved soil moisture condition
• 
Higher nitrogen availability
• 
Seedling protection: Stubbles protects young 
seedling from wind and heat
• 
Crop yields will be on par with traditional 
tillage system. However good yield can be 
harvested during dry years
• 
Reduce labour and save time
• 
Savings on equipment cost
• 
Savings on oil/fuel cost
Mulching: Benefits of crop residue mulch-
ing are
• 
Increased availability of water and organic 
matter 
• 
Less erosion
• 
Environment protection
Additional benefit to farmers
• 
Less drought susceptibility
• 
Improved soil quality and fertilizer efficiency
• 
Minimises long term dependency on external

1.6. Irrigation
A
n adequate water supply is important for plant 
growth. When rainfall is not sufficient, the 
plants must receive additional water from irriga-
tion. 
Points consider for irrigation decisions
• 
Land suitability for irrigation like slope
• 
Effective rainfall: Part of the total rain is useful 
for crop production
• 
When to irrigate: Decide based on soil, crop 
and climatic condition
• 
How much to irrigate: Decide based on crop 
water requirement 
• 
How to irrigate: Select appropriate method for 
irrigation
• 
Quality of irrigation water
1.6.1. Various methods can be used to 
supply irrigation water to the plants
• 
Surface irrigation:	
• 
Basin irrigation
• 
Furrow irrigation
• 
Sprinkler irrigation	
• 
Drip irrigation	
Surface Irrigation
Surface irrigation is the application of water by 
gravity flow to the surface of the field. 
• 
Either the entire field is flooded (Basin Irriga-
tion) or the water is fed into small channels 
(furrows) or strips of land (borders).
Basin Irrigation
• 
Basins are flat areas of land, surrounded by 
low bunds. 
• 
The bunds prevent the water from flowing 
to the adjacent fields. 
• 
Basin irrigation is commonly used for rice 
grown on flat lands or in terraces on hill-
sides. Paddy grows best when its roots are 
submerged in water. Hence, basin irrigation 
is the best method to use for this kind of 
crop.
• 
Trees can also be grown in basins, where 
one tree is usually located in the middle of a 
small basin.
• 
In general, the basin method is suitable for 
crops that are no affected by standing in 
water for longer periods. 
• 
Basin irrigation is suitable for many field 
crops. 
• 
Crops suitable for basin irrigation include 
pastures, citrus, banana and crops that are 
broadcasted such as cereals and to some 
extent row crops such as tobacco.
• 
Basin irrigation is generally not suited to 
crops, which cannot stand in wet or water-
logged conditions for periods longer than 24 
hours; eg: potatoes, beet root and carrots 
• 
The flatter the land surface, the easier it is to 
construct basins. 
• 
It is also possible to construct basins on 
sloping land, even when the slope is quite 
steep. Level basins, called terraces, can be 
constructed like the steps of a staircase.
• 
Soils suitable for basin irrigation depend on 
the crop grown. 
Basin should be small if the:
• 
Slope of the land is steep
• 
Soil is sandy
• 
Stream size to the basin is small
• 
Required depth of the irrigation application 
is small
• 
Field preparation is done by hand or animal 
power
Basin can be large if the:
• 
Slope of the land is gentle or flat
• 
Soil is clay
• 
Stream size to the basin is large
• 
Required depth of the irrigation application 
is large
• 
Field preparation is mechanized
• 
The land slope, the soil type, the available 
stream size, the required depth of the ir-
rigation application and farming practices 
mainly determine the shape and size of 
basins
• 
If the land slope is steep, the basin should be 
narrow; otherwise too much earth move-
ment will be needed to obtain level basins. 
• 
Three other factors, which may affect basin 
width, are depth of fertile soil, method of 
basin construction, agricultural practices.
• 
There are two methods to supply irrigation 
water to basins: (i) The direct method: Ir-
rigation water is led directly from the field 
channel into the basin through siphons, 

14
General Conditions for Cultivation of Crops
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
or bund breaks. (ii) The cascade method: 
irrigation water is supplied to the highest 
terrace, and then allowed to flow to a lower 
terrace and so on. 
Maintenance of basins
• 
Bunds are susceptible to erosion. This may 
be caused by, for example, rainfall, flood or 
the passing of people when used as foot-
paths. 
• 
Rats may dig holes in the sides of the bunds. 
• 
Therefore, it is important to check the bunds 
regularly, notice defects and repair them 
instantly, before greater damage is done. 
Advantages of basin irrigation
• 
Conservation of rainfall and reduction in 
soil erosion.
• 
High water application and distribution ef-
ficiencies.
• 
Useful in leaching of salts.
• 
Suitable to all close growing crops, row 
crops and orchards.
Furrow irrigation
• 
Furrows are small channels, which carry water 
down the land slope between the crop rows. 
• 
Water infiltrates into the soil as it moves along 
the slope. 
• 
The crop is usually grown on the ridges be-
tween the furrows.
• 
This method is suitable for all row crops and for 
crops that cannot stand in water for long peri-
ods. Crops such as maize, sunflower, sugarcane, 
and soybean can be irrigated by furrow irriga-
tion.
• 
Crops that would be damaged by inundation, 
such as tomatoes, vegetables, potatoes, beans; 
fruit trees like citrus and grape as well as broad-
casted crops like wheat.
• 
Irrigation water flows from the field channel 
into the furrows by opening up the bank of the 
channel or by means of siphons or spiles.
• 
Furrows must be on consonance with the slope, 
soil type, stream size, irrigation depth, cultiva-
tion practice and field length.
• 
Uniform flat or gentle slopes are preferred for 
furrow irrigation.
• 
On undulating land, furrows should follow the 
land contours.
Advantages of furrow irrigation
• 
Suitable for row crops and vegetables.
• 
Suitable for soils in which the infiltration 
rates vary between 0.5 and 2.5 cm/hr. 
• 
Ideal for slopes varying from 0.2 to 0.5 per 
cent and a stream size of 1-2 liters/sec. 
• 
In areas requiring surface drainage or prone 
to temporary water logging, furrows are 
very effective.
• 
In areas where water for irrigation purposes. 
is scarce, the practice of alternate or skip 
furrow irrigation can save considerable 
quantity of water without significantly af-
fecting yields.  
Sprinkler irrigation
Water is pumped through a pipe system and then 
sprayed onto the crops through sprinkler heads.
Advantages
• 
Water conservation
• 
Soil conservation 
• 
Efficient use of water
• 
Saving of labour
• 
Early seed germination
•

Drip irrigation
Water is conveyed under pressure through a pipe 
system to the fields, from where it is discharged 
slowly or at a pre designed rate. The latter can be 
matched to the soil infiltration capacity through 
emitters or drippers that are located close to the 
root zone of the plants. 
A typical drip irrigation system consists of the 
following components:
• 
Pump unit
• 
Control unit

1.7. Seed 
A 
’seed’ (in some plants, referred to as a ‘kernel’) 
is a small embryonic ’plant’ enclosed in a cov-
ering called the seed coat, usually with some ‘stored 
food’. Seeds fundamentally are a means of repro-
duction and most seeds are the product of ‘sexual 
reproduction’, which remixes genetic material and 
‘phenotype variability’ that ‘natural selection’ acts 
upon.
The seed is the basic input in agriculture upon 
which other inputs are applied. A good vigorous 
seed utilizes all the resources and realizes a reason-
able output to the grower. It is wealth to the farmer 
since yesterday’s harvest is tomorrow’s hope. Good 
seed in good soil realizes a good yield. Moreover, it 
is the link between two generations.
Functions of seeds
• 
Nourishment of the embryo
• 
Dispersal to a new location

Seed treatment
Seed treatment is usages of specific products and spe-
cific techniques to improve the growth environment 
for the seed, seedlings and young plants. It ranges 
from a basic dressing to coating and pelleting.
Seed dressing: This is the most common method 
of seed treatment. The seed is dressed with either a 
dry formulation or wet treated with a slurry or liq-
uid formulation. Dressings can be applied at both, 
the farm and industries. Low cost earthen pots can 
be used for mixing pesticides with seed or seed can 
be spread on a polythene sheet. The required quan-
tity of chemical can be sprinkled on the seed lot and 
mixed mechanically by the farmers.
Seed coating: A special binder is used with a for-
mulation to enhance adherence to the seed. 
Seed pelleting: The most sophisticated Seed 
Treatment Technology changes the physical shape 
of a seed to enhance pelletability and handling. Pel-
leting requires specialized application machinery 
and techniques and is the most expensive applica-
tion.	
The farmer must take care of the fol-
lowing while buying the seeds
• 
When purchasing the seed farmer should ob-
tain a bill/cash memo wherein the lot number 
and seed tag number is mentioned.
• 
After purchasing the seed, empty bag/packet 
(pouches) and receipt should be kept safely.
• 
Out of purchased seed, 100 seeds are taken from 
each purchased variety to test them for germi-
nation before sowing in the field. Knowing the 
germination percentage, the farmer can decide 
the seed rate when sowing in the field.

1.8. Cropping systems
F
armers resort to cultivation of a number of crops 
and rotate particular crop combinations. More 
than 250 cropping systems are being followed in In-
dia, of which 30 cropping systems are more preva-
lent. Some of the important cropping systems are:
1.	
Sequential cropping system: 
Growing crops in sequence within a crop year, one 
crop being sown after the harvest of the other. For 
example, rice followed by pigeonpea, pigeonpea fol-
lowed by wheat.
2.	
Intercropping System: 
Growing more than one crop in the same area in 
rows of definite proportion and pattern.
The following intercropping practices 
were found to be remunerative in India’s 
groundnut growing states. 
State
Crop combination
 Maharashtra
Groundnut + Red gram (6:1/4:1)
Groundnut + Soybean (6:2)
Groundnut + Sunflower (6:2/3:1)
 Gujarat
Groundnut + Castor (9:2/3:1)
Groundnut + Sunflower (3:1/2:1)
Groundnut + Red gram (4:1)
Alley cropping 
Is an agroforestry practice in which perennial, pref-
erably leguminous, trees or shrubs are grown simul-
taneously with an arable crop. The trees, managed as 
hedgerows, are grown in wide rows and the crop is 
planted in the interspace or ‘alley’ between the tree 
rows.
During the cropping phase, the trees are pruned. 
Prunings are used as green manure or mulch on the 
crop to improve the organic matter status of the soil 
and to provide nutrients, particularly nitrogen, to 
the crop.

Integrated farming System (IFS)
To feed ever-increasing population of the country, 
extensive cropping system give ways to intensive 
cropping which are exploiting natural resources. 
Therefore in future more thrust will be on efficient 
natural resource management and sustainable pro-
duction system. This encompasses an animal com-
ponent, an perennial and annual crop component, 
aqua culture, agro based production and processing 
units. Integrated farming system typically involves:
• 
Many enterprises including animal component
• 
Planning is based on resource available
• 
It is purely location specific/farmer/holding 
specific activity plan
• 
Very high resource use efficiency
• 
Sustainable farming
         	
Objectives of IFS
• 
To compliment and maximize use of by prod-
ucts
• 
To provide useful employment to all the family 
members
• 
Maximizing land use
• 
Value addition
• 
Self sustainability
• 
Less dependence on external resources
Crop production in IFS 
• 
Food crop should find a place
• 
Family food requirement should be planned
• 
Fodder production to meet the demand of ani-
mal component
• 
Specific enterprise based crops; e.g. mulberry/
sunflower linked to honey
• 
Infrastructure based cropping
• 
Sufficient employment to family members
Animal component in IFS
• 
One or more animal components or combina-
tion of animal component may be planned
• 
Complimentary enterprises should be identi-
fied
• 
Composting should be the interface between 
animal and crop enterprises
• 
Market should be considered before hand
• 
Need based demand driven enterprises should 
be prioritized
Allocation of resource in IFS
• 
List the resources available and required
• 
Prioritize the resources based on scarcity
• 
Resource demand will be prioritized based on 
economic impact and sustainability
• 
Scares resource on the farm should be allocated 
for the most important activity
• 
Recycling of resources should be planned
• 
Resource based contingent plan should be pre-
pared in advance. This will serve as a security 
and sustainable alternative in case of crisis

1.10. Good Agricultural Practices 
(GAP)
G
ood Agricultural Practices (GAP) are "prac-
tices that address environmental, economic and 
social sustainability for on-farm processes, and which 
result in safe and quality food and non-food agricul-
tural products".
What are GAP codes, standards and 
regulations? 
Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) codes, stand-
ards and regulations are guidelines which have 
been developed in recent years by the food industry, 
producers' organizations, governments and NGOs 
aiming to codify agricultural practices at farm level 
for a range of commodities.
Why do GAP codes, standards and 
regulations exist?
These GAP codes, programmes or standards exist 
because of: 
• 
Growing concerns about food quality and safe-
ty worldwide.
• 
Fulfilment of trade and government regulatory 
requirements. 
• 
Specific requirements especially for niche mar-
kets. 
Objectives
• 
Ensuring safety and quality of produce in the 
food chain.
• 
Capturing new market advantages by modify-
ing supply chain governance.
• 
Improving natural resources used, workers' 
health and working conditions to creating new 
market opportunities for farmers and exporters 
in developing countries.
The benefits of GAP codes 
• 
Standards and regulations are numerous, in-
cluding food quality and safety improvement.
• 
Facilitation of market access.
• 
Reduction in non-compliance risks regarding 
permitted pesticides, Maximum Residue Limits 
(MRLs) and other contamination hazards. 
GAP related to crop protection 
• 
Use resistant cultivars and varieties. 
• 
Crop sequences, associations and cultural prac-
tices. 
• 
Biological prevention of pests and diseases.
• 
Maintain regular and quantitative assessment 
of the balance status between pests and diseases 
and beneficial organisms of all crops. 
• 
Adopt organic control practices where and 
when applicable. 
• 
Apply pest and disease forecasting techniques 
where available. 
• 
Determine interventions following considera-
tion of all possible methods and their short and 
long-term effects on farm productivity and en-
vironmental implications. This will allow the 
minimizing of agrochemicals, in particular, to 
promote Integrated Pest Management (IPM). 
• 
Store and use agrochemicals according to le-
gal requirements of registration for individual 
crops, rates, timings, and pre-harvest intervals
• 
Ensure that agrochemicals are only applied by 
specially trained and knowledgeable persons. 
• 
Ensure that equipment used for the handling 
and application of agrochemicals complies with 
established safety and maintenance standards.
• 
Maintain accurate records of agrochemical use.
• 
Identify the GAP in each protection method.
Crop rotation systems 
• 
Sequence crops by selecting pest host relation.
• 
Selected crop for rotation in order to break the 
life cycle of pest (Jowar should be rotated with 
pulses to combat striga weed).
• 
The selected crop for rotation should not be the 
food of previous crop pest.
• 
To select appropriate crops for rotation:
• 
Analyze the pest habitat
• 
Follow forecasts
• 
Monitor pest and natural enemies
Privilege resistant species 
• 
Cultivate plant varieties which are less prone to 
pest attack.
• 
The resistant varieties reduce production cost.
• 
Pest resistant transgenic crops developed for 
specific pest can be used. This is new avenue for 
reducing pesticide load.

e.g. keeping bird perch in the field.
• 
Identify the useful animals and study their hab-
itat for providing the required environment.
Observe and control populations
• 
Follow forecast-short term and long term.
• 
Study habitat of pest and congenial weather.
• 
Accordingly take necessary precautions to 
manage pest.
Give priority to mechanical and biological 
measures (instead of chemical)
• 
Get the full knowledge about botanical pesti-
cides.
• 
Get the knowledge on available parasites and 
predator/friendly insects and pests.
• 
Accordingly develop action plan for mechani-
cal and biological measures.
• 
Use non cash inputs: Saves money.
• 
Use information on plant protection: Analyze 
spatial and temporal distribution and trend 
analysis. 
Monitoring of performance through taking 
notes each year/season. 
• 
Keep the pest management record along with 
season, weather and other agriculture activity.
• 
Document the pest load and control achieved
• 
Use this experience for future planning.
Precision farming: Use precision farming mod-
ules and apply Information Technology (IT) to 
economize and for effective monitoring.
Good Agriculture Practices help the farmers to make 
use of the opportunities available in International 
Markets for selling their products and realising bet-
ter farm profits.
1.10. Lessons Learnt
1.	 Critical factors to be considered while de-
ciding the crops and cropping pattern are 
climatic factors, soil conservation, water, 
cropping system options, past and present 
experiences of farmers, expected profit 
and risk, economic conditions of farmers 
including land holding, labour availability, 
mechanization potential technology avail-
ability and suitability, demand and avail-
ability of market policies and schemes, 
public and private extension influence, 
availability of required agricultural inputs 
including agricultural credit and post har-
vest storage and processing technologies.
2.	 Soil, water and wind erosion may be man-
aged through various recommended prac-
tices.
3.	 Method of irrigation has to be decided 
considering the quantity of water available 
and crop to be grown.
4.	 Recommended certified seeds may be 
used.
5.	 Mechanisation enhances quality of agri-
cultural operations and minimises the cost 
and dependence on labour.
6.	 Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) may 
be considered essentials to enhance the 
price and market competitiveness of the 
produce.

2.3. What is Soil? 
S
oil is a thin layer of earth’s crust, which serves as 
natural medium for the growth of plants. Rocks 
are the important sources for the parent materials 
over which soils are developed.
Soil Constituents 
Soil is a dynamic medium made up of minerals, or-
ganic matter, water, air and living creatures includ-
ing bacteria and earthworms.
It was formed and is forever changing due to 5 major 
physical factors: parent material, time, climate, or-
ganisms present and topography. The way in which 
we manage soil is another major factor influencing 
the character of the soil.

Soil and Plant Nutrition
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
Soil colour
• 
Dark colour indicates usually medium to high 
fertility due to high amount of organic matter. 
These soils have usually high amount of nutri-
ents, good water holding capacity and structure 
and are well aerated.  
• 
Light colour indicates medium to low fertil-
ity. These soils may have leaching issue (water 
makes organic matter and other nutrients move 
downward faster).
	
Soil depth
• 
The depth of soil to which the roots of a plant 
can readily penetrate to in order to reach water 
and nutrients.
• 
Minimum of 3-5 feet is desirable, deeper soils 
are better because they can hold more nutrients 
and water.
	
        
Soil texture
• 
Texture refers to relative proportion of miner-
al particles (sand, silt, and clay) in soil. Many 
properties of soils; e.g. drainage, water holding 
capacity, aeration and the nutrient availability; 
depend largely on soil texture. 
• 
Sandy: Low fertility and water holding capacity 
but good aeration.
• 
Loamy: Medium fertility and good aeration.
• 
Clayey: High fertility and poor aeration, hard 
to plough.
• 
Farmers may refer to their soil as heavy or light, 
illustrating the ease of working. The heavy soils 
are usually hard to plough and require much 
more effort than light soils. Organic matter may 
be added to improve the soil texture.

Soil pH
• 
Soil pH is of utmost importance in plant growth 
as it influences nutrient availability, toxicities 
and the activity of soil organisms.
Tips for soil pH management
• 
Acid soils are to be corrected by using lime, 
quantity of lime application is as per soil test 
report.
• 
Alkali soils are to be corrected by gypsum/sul-
phur, quantity of application is as per soil test 
report.
• 
Saline – alkali soils should be treated with gyp-
sum and improved drainage.
Soil organic matter
• 
Soil organic matter is the mix of plant and ani-
mal matter in different stages of decay.
• 
Soil organic matter plays a key role in biologi-
cal, physical, and chemical function in soil.
Soil organic matter helps by:
• 
Providing nutrients for soil organisms
• 
Acting as major reservoir of plant nutrients
• 
Making nutrient exchange between soil and 
root of the plants easier
• 
Improving soil structure
• 
Influencing soil temperature
• 
Reducing the risk of soil erosion
• 
Increasing water holding capacity
Soil organic matter can be improved 
through:
• 
Recycling the crop residue back to field 
without wasting and burning
• 
Applying compost

• 
Soil gradient is the angle of inclination of the soil surface from the soil.
• 
It is expressed in percentage, which is the number of feet raise or fall in 100 feet from the horizontal 
distance.
• 
Mild gradient up to 1% is desirable. 
• 
Higher gradients are not desirable as it leads to soil and water erosion.
• 
Perfect levelling is required only for paddy crop.

Carbon - Nitrogen Ratio (C:N Ratio)
There are chemical elements in the organic matter, 
which are extremely important, especially in their 
relation or proportion to each other. They are Car-
bon and Nitrogen. The relationship is called Car-
bon - Nitrogen Ratio (C:N Ratio). For example, 
composed manure has 20:1 and sawdust has 400:1 
of carbon and nitrogen. Generally speaking, the 
legumes are highest in nitrogen and have low C:N 
Ratio, which is highly desirable. Farmers can use 
blood meal, bone meal, poultry manure, cottonseed 
meal and soybean meal and other nitrogen rich ma-
terial as organic matter, which enhance the decom-
position.
Electrical Conductivity (EC): EC is normally consid-
ered to be a measurement of the dissolved salts in a 
solution.
General interpretation of EC values 
Through application of zypsum, the saline/sodic 
soils can be amended. The quantity of zypsum to 
be applied is decided by EC value. Farmers having 
problem of saline/sodic soils can go for soil testing 
and approach extension officials for further guid-
ance.
Soil fertility
• 
Soil fertility is generally defined as “ability of 
soil to supply plant nutrients”. Soil structure, 
soil texture, temperature, water, light and air 
also play an important role in maintaining soil 
fertility.
• 
Plant nutrients which are often scarce in soil 
are nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus since 
plants use large amounts for their growth and 
survival.
• 
Important nutrients, their function and defi-
ciency symptoms are described below.

2.4. Deficiency Symptoms of Nutrients in Plants
Nitrogen (N) – deficiency symptoms
1.	 Stunted growth.
2.	 Appearance of light green to pale-yellow col-
our on the older leaves, starting from the tips. 
This is followed by death and/or dropping of 
the older leaves depending upon the degree 
of deficiency.
3.	 In acute deficiency, flowering is greatly re-
duced.
4.	 Lower protein content.
 
Phosphorous (P) – deficiency  
symptoms
1.	 Overall stunted appearance, the mature 
leaves have characteristic dark to blue-green 
colouration, restricted root development.
2.	 In acute deficiency, occasional purpling of 
leaves and stems; spindly growth.
3.	 Delayed maturity and poor seed and fruit de-
velopment.
Potassium (K) – deficiency  
symptoms
1.	 Chlorosis along the leaf margins followed 
by scorching and browning of tips of older 
leaves. These symptoms then gradually 
progress inwards.
2.	 Slow and stunted growth of plants.
3.	 Stalks weaken and plant lodge easily.
4.	 Shrivelled seeds of fruits.

Soil and Plant Nutrition
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
Calcium (Ca) – deficiency symptoms
1.	 Calcium deficiencies are not seen in the field 
because secondary effects associated with 
high acidity limit growth.
2.	 The young leaves of new plants are affected 
first. These are often distorted, small and ab-
normally dark green.
3.	 Leaves may be cup-shaped and crinkled and 
the terminal buds deteriorate with some 
breakdown of petioles.
4.	 Root growth is markedly impaired; rooting of 
roots occurs.
5.	 Dessication of growing points (terminal 
buds) of plants under severe deficiency.
6.	 Buds and blossoms shed prematurely.
7.	 Stem structure weakened.
Magnesium (Mg) – deficiency  
symptoms
1.	 Interveinal chlorosis, mainly of older leaves, 
producing a streaked or patchy effect; with 
acute deficiency, the affected tissue may dry 
up and die.
2.	 Leaves usually small, brittle in final stages 
and curve upwards at margin.
3.	 In some vegetable plants, chlorotic spot be-
tween veins, with tints of orange, red and 
purple.
4.	 Twigs weak and prone to fungus attack, usu-
ally premature, leaf drop.
Sulphur (S) deficiency symptoms
1.	 Younger leaves turn uniformly yellowish 
green or chlorotic.
2.	 Root growth is restricted, flower production

Zinc (Zn) deficiency symptoms
1.	 Deficiency symptoms mostly appear on the 
2nd or 3rd fully mature leaves from the top 
of plants.
2.	 In maize, from light yellow striping to a broad 
band of white or yellow tissue with reddish 
purple veins between the midrib and edges 
of the leaf, occurring mainly in the lower half 
of the leaf.
3.	 In wheat, a longitudinal band of white or yel-
low leaf tissue, followed by interveinal chlo-
rotic mottling and white to brown necrotic 
lesions in the middle of the leaf blade; even-
tual collapse of the affected leaves near the 
middle.
4.	 In rice, after 15-20 days of transplanting, 
small scattered light yellow spots appear on 
the older leaves which later enlarge, coalesce 
and turn deep brown, the entire leaf becomes 
rust-brown in colour and dries out within a 
month.
5.	 In citrus, irregular interveinal chlorosis; ter-
minal leaves become small and barrowed 
(little-leaf); fruit-bud formation is severely 
reduced, twigs die back plants.
Copper (Cu) - deficiency symptoms
1.	 In cereals, yellowing and curling of the leaf 
blades, restricted ear production and poor 
grain set, indeterminate tillering.
2.	 In citrus, die back of new growth; exanthema 
pockets of gum develop between the bark 
and the weed; the fruit shows brown spots.
Iron (Fe) - deficiency symptoms
1.	 Typical interveinal chlorosls; youngest leaves 
first affected, points and margins of leaves 
keep their green colour longest.
2.	 In severe case, the entire leaf, veins and in-
terveinal area turn yellow and may eventually 
become bleached.

Some common deficiency symptoms are:
 
Chlorosis - It is the loss of chlorophyll leading 
to yellowing in leaves. It is caused by the defi-
ciency of elements like K, Mg, N, S, Fe, Mn, Zn 
and Mo.
Necrosis are death of tissues, particularly leaf 
tissue is caused by deficiency of K, Ca, Mg
Inhibition of cell division is caused due to lack or deficiency of N, K, S and Mo.
 
Premature fall of leaves and buds 
• 
deficiency of K and P.

A. Soil Analysis: Key to a Successful 
Nutrient Management Plan
H
igher crop yields and quality of 
the crops depend largely on the ef-
ficient supply of nutrients. Soil provides 
not only the medium but also functions 
as the source of these nutrients for the 
plants. Soil resources get depleted with 
every harvest and need to be replenished 
for every crop. However, one must know 
which nutrients are to what extent deplet-
ed and what addition of fertilizers should 
be planned accordingly. Soil analysis, in 
this regard, helps in determining the level 
of nutrients and in deciding the required 
amount of fertilizer application.
Accuracy of soil analysis is directly relat-
ed to the quality of the soil sample taken. 
Application of appropriate fertilizers with 
the proper nutrient mix will help not only 
to increase the productivity and farm in-
come but also provide a more realistic 
chance to obtain the desired yield. There 
are various methods for taking a soil sam-
ple from a field. The right method of sam-
pling may be decided by consulting local 
extension officer or your DESAI-trainer.

B. Plant Analysis
P
lant Analysis is the second tool, after soil test-
ing that is critical to improve crop nutrition and 
yield. Only plant analysis can identify the actual 
nutrient status of a plant or crop. While soil testing 
identifies the nutrients offered to the crop or plants, 
Plant analysis identifies how well the plants utilizes 
the soil nutrients and applied nutrients. Plant analy-
sis allows the plant to tell us what nutrients it needs.
 It is critical that the correct plant part and stage of 
growth be sampled. The normal nutrient concentra-
tion differs between the various plant parts. Also, 
the normal nutrient concentration of each plant 
part changes as the plant matures. It is important 
to keep these factors in mind to assess the nutrients 
status of plants. The plant parts required to be col-
lected for different crops are as follows.

C. Irrigation Water Analysis
I
rrigation water, irrespective of its source, always 
contains some soluble salts. The suitability of wa-
ters for a specific purpose depends upon the types 
and amounts of dissolved salts. Some of the dis-
solved salts or other constituents may be useful for 
crops but the quality or suitability of water for irri-
gation purposes is assessed in terms of the presence 
of undesirable constituents. Some of the dissolved 
ions such as NO3 are useful for crops.
The most important characteristic that de-
termine the quality of irrigation water are:
• 
pH
• 
Total concentration of soluble salts are judged 
through Electrical Conductivity (EC).
• 
Relative proportion of sodium to other cations 
such as Ca and Mg are referred to as      Sodium 
Adsorption Ratio (SAR).
• 
Concentration of boron or other elements that 
may be toxic to plants.
• 
Concentration of carbonates and bi-carbonate 
as related to the concentration of calcium plus 
magnesium are referred to as Residual Sodium 
Carbonate (RSC).
• 
Content of anions such as chloride, sulphate 
and nitrate.
Methods of water sample collection
As water quality and suitability plays an important 
role in deciding production and productivity of 
crops, farmers are advised consult extension worker 
to test the water.

Although 
the 
ability of the 
soil to supply 
the plants with 
the 
required 
nutrients depends also on the soil condition like i.e. 
soil texture, soil structure and soil organic matter. 
Therefore, soil fertility management does not only 
include nutrient management but also soil condi-
tion management. 
Apart from other soil management practices, 
soil fertility focuses on:
• 
Maintain a balance between nutrient uptake 
and nutrient application.
• 
Adequate fertility for the plants at the specific 
growth stages.
• 
Soil fertility and organic matter maintenance
• 
Minimizing the nutrient loss by avoiding excess 
application.

The soil nutrient demand usually is based on:
• 
Soil nutrient level
• 
Crop variety and yielding ability
• 
Soil moisture
• 
Targeted yield
Soil analysis direct the farmer on quantity and qual-
ity of fertilisers to be used. Farmers can get the crop 
specific nutrient (fertilizer) recommendations af-
ter consulting the local extension service or their 
DESAI-trainer and discussing with them the soil 
analysis report. 
C. Recommended Fertilizer Dose for 
Important Crops
G
eneral considerations before fertilizer applica-
tion:
• 
Nutrients and not fertilizers should be bought. 
(Think nutrients, not fertilizers).
• 
Each nutrient applied as fertilizer should give a 
desired production response.
• 
The cost of fertilization must be calculated on 
the basis of applied plant nutrients per unit area 
of land.
• 
Calculate one nutrient at a time, considering 
available sources, prices and feasibility of using.
• 
A sample Soil Health Card, issued to the farm-
ers based on the soil test results, should be used 
by the farmer to calculate the quantities of fer-
tilizers required:

Disadvantages:
• 
Over application usually results in economic 
and environmental losses.
• 
Over supply makes plant tissues soft and vul-
nerable to diseases and pathogens.
• 
Increased rate of soil organic matter decompo-
sition resulting in soil degradation.
• 
Many nutrients applied are easily lost through 
different chemical reactions.
Organic fertilizers
Advantages:
• 
Balanced nutrient supply.
• 
Enhance the soil biological activity.
• 
Help in improving soil structure.
• 
Increase the organic matter content.
• 
Slow release of nutrients makes soil on the long 
run fertile.
• 
Help in combating plant diseases.
Disadvantages
• 
Low nutrient content.
• 
Only effective in the long run.
• 
It may not supply all the nutrients required for 
plant growth.
• 
High cost.
• 
Bulkiness.
Efficient fertilizer use
Good knowledge and management practices can 
improve the fertilizer use efficiency.
• 
Select the crops and varieties that suit the local-
ity and have best fertilizer response.
• 
Select right kind of fertilizer according to crop 
and soil.
• 
The fertilization should be planned for the 
cropping pattern and not for single crops.
• 
Fertilization application rate should be decided 
only after discussing your soil analysis report 
with your local extension officer or Desai-
Trainer.
• 
Balanced fertilization should be practiced.
• 
Crops should only be sown at the locally rec-
ommended periods.
• 
Maintain optimum plant population and prop-
er plant spacing.
• 
Effective control of pests and diseases will help 
in maximizing the fertilizer efficiency.
• 
To maximize the yield increase through ferti-
lizer, all other growth critical factors must also 
be optimum e.g. crop must be irrigated at criti-
cal growth stages.
Fertilizer application methods
Broadcasting: fertilizer is distributed manually 
over the cropped field.
• 
The most common fertilizer application 
method.
• 
Highly inefficient method
• 
High economic and nutrient losses
Placement: application in band or packets near 
the plants.
• 
Two sub-types:
	
i.	
Band application                                	
	
ii.

Method of application and nutrients
The method of application should be chosen ac-
cording to the nutrient, crop, soil and cultivation 
method. 
• 
Nitrogen application should be applied in splits 
and slow release mode to minimize loss.
• 
Frequent application in small quantity through 
foliar application is most efficient and results in 
quick recovery of crops.
• 
Use slow release nitrogen for plantation crops 
and long duration crops.
• 
Under puddle condition, use coated urea-neem 
oil. Coal tar sulphur coating will make urea to 
release nitrogen slow to match the uptake pat-
tern.
• 
Urea can be cured with soil (1 part urea with 
5-10 parts soil) to reduce the losses.
• 
Phosphate should be placed 4 to 6 cm below 
and 4 to 6 cm away from the seeds to ensure 
maximum availability.
• 
Phosphatic fertilizers give better response when 
placed in bands near the plant rows.
• 
Potassic fertilizers can be applied in one dose 
as basal application but for long duration crops 
the fertilizer application may be done in 2 to 3 
splits.
Fertilizer calculations
Here is an example for the application of fertilizers 
based on the soil test recommendations. Suppose 
the recommendations are 120 kg N, 60 Kg P and 40 
Kg K per ha. Calculate the quantity of urea, super-
phosphate and muriate of potash fertilizers needed 
to supply the recommended doses!  
Urea content is 46%, so to supply 46 kg N/ha 
100 kg urea is required. To supply 120 kg N/ha 
100/46*120=260.9 or 261 kg urea is required. Simi-
larly super phosphate content is 16% P2O5 and the 
recommendation is given in the form of Phospho-
rous.
• 
% P  = %P2O5 X 0.44
• 
Kg P = kg P2O5 X 0.44
• 
Kg P = 16 X 0.44
• 
Kg P = 7.04
So super phosphate contains 7.04 P and the recom-
mendation is given as 60 kg P.
To supply 60 kg P=100/7.04*60=852.27 or 852 kg 
single super phosphate is required. Similarly, we 
have to calculate the dose of potash through Muri-
ate of Potash (MOP) as MOP contains 60% K2O. 
So MOP contains 49.8 K and the recommendation 
given is 40 kg K/ha.
To supply 40 kg K=100/49.8*40=80.3 kg or 80 kg 
MOP is required. So based on fertilizer analysis and 
soil test information the fertilizer application rates 
are calculated as above.

Nutrient cost comparison
Example - 1
1.	Urea with 46% N costs Rs.562.20 per 100 kg.
2.	Ammonium sulphate 20% N costs Rs.1029 per 
100 kg.
Urea has 46% N i.e. 46 kg N in every 100 kg urea. 
Therefore unit value of N in urea: 562.2/46= Rs.12.22 
per kg N. Ammonium sulphate has 20.6% N i.e. 20 
kg N in every 100 kg fertilizer and 24% sulphur. 
Therefore unit value of N in ammonium sulphate: 
1029/20.6= Rs.49.95 per kg N. Thus, the nitrogen is 
cheaper in urea. Yet, ammonium sulphate also has 
24% sulphur in it.
Therefore, for soils with sulphur deficiency, am-
monium sulphate is a better choice and for soils 
with normal sulphur levels, urea presents a better 
N source.
Example - 2
1.	 Single Super Phosphate (SSP) with 7 % P 
costs Rs.480 per 100 kg.
2.	 Di - Ammonium Phosphate (DAP) 20% P 
and 18% N costs Rs.1596 per 100 kg.
SSP has 7% P i.e. 7 kg P in every 100 kg SSP. There-
fore unit value of P in SSP: 480/7= Rs.68.57 per kg P.
Whereas, DAP has 20% P and 18% N, i.e. 20 kg P 
and 18 kg of N in every 100 kg of DAP.
Cost of Nitrogen in 100 kg of DAP = (18 X 12.22 ) = 
Rs.219.96. Therefore unit value of P in DAP: (1596 
– 219.96 = 1376.00); i.e. 1376/20=  Rs.68.80 per kg P
Thus, the unit cost of P is the same in both the ferti-
lisers. Yet, DAP also has 18% N in it. Therefore, for 
soils with nitrogen requirement, DAP is the better 
choice.

Organic fertilizers
Organic manures are natural products used to pro-
vide the nutrients to crops. Examples of organic 
manure are cow dung, farmyard manure, green ma-
nure, compost from crop residues, vermicompost 
and other biological waste.
Organic manures increase the organic matter in the 
soil. Organic matter in turn releases the plant food 
in available form for the use of crops. However, or-
ganic manures should not be seen only as carriers of 
plant food. These manures also enable a soil to hold 
more water and also help to improve the drainage 
in clay soils. They provide organic acids that help to 
dissolve soil nutrients and make them available for 
the plants.
Additionally, organic manures have low nutrient 
content and, therefore, need to be applied in large 
quantities. For example, to get a standard mixture 
of 25 kg NPK, almost 1000-2000 kg organic manure 
is required, whereas the same amount of NPK can 
be easily obtained with a 50 kg bag of NPK fertilizer.
Compost: Compost is well decomposed organic 
wastes like plant residues, animal dung and urine 
earth from cattle sheds, waste fodder, etc.	
Tips for FYM preparation
• 
Provide shade to compost site
• 
Make compost pit in a well drained elevated 
place
• 
Smaller heaps of manageable shape are better
• 
Keep the pit free from weeds
• 
Pit should be near to cattle shed and water 
source
• 
Allowing for full maturity
• 
Also use urine 
• 
If ash is added do not heap in the pit but spread 
uniformly
How to use
• 
Manure should not be kept exposed in the field 
before application
• 
Preferably apply in bands into the soil instead 
of broadcast. In case broadcast, work it into the 
soil immediately
Advantage
• 
Complete plant nutrient
• 
Improved soil structure increases soil aeration 
and drainability
• 
Organic matter acts as biological clay and in-
crease nutrient and water holding capacity of 
soil
• 
It reduces the bulk density to desirable level 
(1.3g/cc)
• 
It provides enough food for micro organisms in 
the soil and helps to build up microorganisms 
in the soil
• 
Nutrients slow release nature is very useful for 
long duration and plantation crops
Disadvantage
• 
It is bulky
• 
Cost of handling, transportation and storage 
are high
• 
High labour input
• 
High cost per kg of nutrients
Vermi-Compost: Vermi-composting is a process 
by which earthworms convert organic waste into 
fertile manure. Important spp of earthworm used 
for vermicomposting in Indian conditions are Epi-
geic Eugeniae, Eisenia Foetida, and Perionyx Exca-
vatus. 
Earthworms
• 
Feed on soil and soil organic matter and con-
vert it into compost
• 
Encourage growth of useful micro organisms
• 
Aerate and pulverize the soil
• 
Make soil porous and improving drainage
• 
Increasing water holding capacity of soil
• 
Give strength to plant immunity system
Advantages of vermi-compost
• 
Easy to use
• 
Low cost to produce
• 
Convert organic matter in to good manure in 
short time
How to make it
• 
Enrich vermi-compost with bio-agents 
• 
Earthworms are our friends. Protect them and 
nurture in the field
Green manures
• 
Select important species
• 
Find a season to fit the green manuring crop in 
to cropping system
• 
Incorporate when 45 days old
• 
Allow 15-20 days before next planting for de-
composition
Example: Sunhemp and Daincha
Green leaf manure
•

Liquid Fertilisers
• 
Liquid form of fertilizers are applied with irri-
gation water or for direct application through 
foliar spray to augment yield and improve qual-
ity of a variety of crops like fruits, vegetables, 
oil seeds, pulses, cereals, cotton, tobacco, sug-
arcane, tea, etc.
• 
It will ease handling, less labour requirement as 
well as the possibility of mixing with herbicides 
have made the liquid fertilisers more acceptable 
to farmers
Fertigation
• 
Fertigation is the judicious application of ferti-
lizers by combining it with irrigation water
• 
Fertigation can be achieved through fertilizer 
tank, venturi system, injector pump, Non-Elec-
tric Proportional Liquid Dispenser (NEPLD) 
and automated system
Advantages of Fertigation
• 
Ensures a regular flow of water as well as , re-
sulting in increased growth rates for higher 
yields
• 
Offers greater versatility in the timing of the 
nutrient application to meet specific crop de-
mands
• 
Improves availability of nutrients and their up-
take by the roots
• 
Safer application method which eliminates the 
danger of burning the plant root system
• 
Offers simpler and more convenient applica-
tion than soil application of fertilizer, thus, sav-
ing time, labour, equipment and energy
• 
Improves fertilizer use efficiency
• 
Reduction of soil compaction and mechanical 
damage to the crops

Bio-Fertilizers
These are products of microbial origin containing 
live cells of micro organisms multiplied in a labo-
ratory and mixed with a carrier material like finely 
powdered coal, lignite or humus and supplied in a 
solid form.
Basically two types of bio fertilizer distinguished 
based on their capacity to supply nitrogen or phos-
phorus. Some bio-fertilizers have the capacity to 
supply nitrogen because they have the capacity to 
absorb nitrogen gas from the atmosphere in asso-
ciation with plants and use the nutrient for their cell 
synthesis. The nitrogen fixed becomes available to 
crop plants after the plant material is incorporated 
in to soil. This process is known as symbiotic nitro-
gen fixation. Other nitrogen fixing organisms can 
live freely in soil and fix nitrogen. There is one more 
type where the organism establishes a weak or as-
sociative symbiosis and fixes nitrogen.
In addition to nitrogen fixers there are some bacte-
ria and fungi, which are used as bio-fertilizers to en-
hance phosphorus supply to crops. They solubilize 
insoluble or difficulty soluble phosphorus through 
their capacity to produce organic acids.

• 
The best nutrient management method is Integrated Nutrient Management.
• 
Use bulk quantity of organic matter to provide good physical and chemical prop-
erties to soil.
• 
Smaller quantities of chemical fertilizer to provide quick release, which matches 
the uptake pattern of crops.
All bio-fertilizers are microorganisms belonging to 
group of bacteria or fungi or blue-green algae.
The capacity of N-Fixers to supply N to crops var-
ies from 10 kg – 100 kg/ha and symbiotic nitrogen 
fixers particularly rhizobium bacteria are very effi-
cient. The P-Solubilizers and P-Absorbers can mo-
bilize insoluble phosphorus to the extent of 10 Kg 
to 50 kg P/ha. Mycorrihizae are symbiotic fungi, 
which get associated with plant roots. Azolla is a 
water fern which establishes a very active and ben-
eficial association with blue-green algae - Anabaena 
Algal inoculants are cultivated on submerged soils 
in tanks, dried and supplied as soil based culture 
(Inoculants). Endomycorrhizal inoculants are sup-
plied as pieces of roots of grass plants infected with 
mycorrhizae. Ectomycorrihizal inoculants are culti-
vated in the laboratory and mixed with carrier ma-
terial for supply. Azolla are supplied as fresh fronds 
(leaf). The bio-fertilizers are inoculated to seeds or 
applied directly to soil after suspending them in wa-
ter. Azolla is applied directly to soil, which on mul-
tiplication establishes a very active symbiotic asso-
ciation with Anabaena, a blue-green alga.

anana is one of the most commonly grown fruit crop of the country. India produces about 
26.217 MT of banana from an area of 0.709 Mha with an average productivity of 37.0 mt/ha. 
Major producing states are Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, As-
sam and Madhya Pradesh. Tamil Nadu has 0.1244 mha under banana and the total production 
during 2008-09 is 6.667 Mmt with 53.6 mt/ha productivity. In Gujarat, banana crop is cultivated 
in 11 districts covering an area of about 60900 ha. Gujarat is ranking 3rd among the states of India 
with an average productivity of 58.7t/ha. Unripe fruits are used for making chips, vegetable flour, 
etc. Ripened fruits are used for preparing drink, jam, beer, salad, etc. Banana fruits are having 
numerous medicinal uses (as per Ayurveda). From psedostem threads are obtained and used for 
making rope and cloths.  
Prevailing Varieties: Basarai, Lokhandi, Robasta, Shreemanti and Grand Naine.
Climate: Banana grows well in warm and humid climate with an average temperature of 27oC 
and rainfall of 2,000 to 2,500 mm. However, it requires assured irrigation facility.
Soil type suitability: Loamy and salty clay loam soils with good fertility status are best suited 
for banana cultivation. However, extremely clayey and sandy soils are not suitable for banana crop.
Land preparation: The land should be ploughed, harrowed and planked to achieve levelled 
fields. For planting banana, dugout a pit of 30 x 30 x 30 cm size at a spacing of 1.5 x 1.5 m.
Soil sterilization: After land preparation, the pits should be exposed to the sunlight for 10 to 
15 days. In the case of heavy infestation of soil born pest and diseases, the soil solarization should 
be done using transparent plastic for a period of 15 to 20 days during summer season (preferably 
during May).
Time of plating: Optimum time for planting is 15th June to 15th July. Banana planting is done 
either by suckers or tissue culture plant.
Suckers: Suckers should be selected from a healthy field of banana. Sufficient care should be 
taken that suckers should not be damaged during digging and transport. Fresh sucker, weighing 
about 500 to 1,500 g, should be selected. For control of fungal diseases, suckers should be dipped 
in a solution of aurofugine1 (10 g / 100 litres of water) for 1.5 hour prior to planting.
Tissue culture plant: Select healthy and uniform plants.
Irrigation and scheduling: The water requirement of banana crop by surface method of ir-
rigation (25-30 irrigations) is 1,500-1,800 mm. By drip irrigation method, water requirement is 
900-1,080 mm. The drip system should be operated on alternate day for a period of 1.05 to 2.25 
hours during winter and 2.5 to 2.75 hrs during summer at a pressure of 1.2 kg/cm2.

Application of Fertilizers
Basal
FYM should be applied @ 20 to 25 t/ha at the time of land preparation. Top dressing of fertilizer 
should be done as given below
For using water-soluble fertilizers, the following schedule of fertigation may be followed:
Nutrient
Fertilizer application schedule
N (180g/plant)
7 to 8 splits at an interval of 15 to 20 
days.
P (72g/plant)
7 to 8 splits at an interval of 15 to 20 
days.
K (180g/plant)
7 to 8 splits at an interval of 15 to 20 
days.
Time of application: The total quantities of water-soluble fertilizers should be applied in 7 to 8 
splits at an interval of 15 to 20 days. The first split should be applied at the time of planting before 
monsoon and the rest should be applied after the cessation of monsoon.
Weeding: Banana fields should be kept weed free either by hand weeding/interculturing or by 
weedicide (diuron @ 1.2 kg/ha as pre emergence) application. Mulching with black plastic (50 mi-
cron) or sugarcane trash (@ 10 t/ha) should be done. If required, hand weeding should be done prior 
to mulching.
Desuckering: First desuckering should be done manually. To minimize the regeneration of suck-
ers, 3 ml of diesel or kerosene should be injected into the cut portion of the suckers.

Control Measures
Rhizome weevil and nematode
Neem based products such as Neem oil, Neem cake, Neem 
seed Kernal extract (NSKE) can be applied.
Bunch coverage: After the complete formation of the bunch, it should be covered by LLDP film 
bag (blue, white or black colour). This improves quality as well as yield of banana.
Time of harvesting: Maturity varies with variety but usually the crop takes about 12-14 months 
to mature.
Yield: By adopting the above practices, the banana yields about 70 to 80 t/ha. Generally, size and 
colour based grading is done.
Post harvest handling and storage: Bananas can be stored for up to a week in a cool place 
but unripe bananas should not be stored in the refrigerator as this may irreversibly interrupt the 
ripening process. If the banana is no longer green, then it is ripe and can be stored for a maximum of 
one week. For storage, banana should be stored at 13o to 140C. Bunches should be kept out of light 
after harvest since this hastens ripening and softening. For export, hands are cut into units of 4-16 
fingers, graded for both length and girths and carefully placed in poly-lined boxes to hold 12 to 18 
kg depending on export requirement. Prior to packaging fruits are cleaned in water or dilute sodium 
hypochlorite solution to remove the latex and treated with thiobendazole.
Plastic packaging: Keeping quality of banana can be increased when packed in 400 gauge LDPE 
(Low-Density Poly Ethylene) bags with or without ventilation either under ambient temperature or 
in a zero energy cool chamber (13.5°C). Storing of banana fruits in unvented polybags at low tem-
perature could extend the shelf life of the fruits up to 19.33 days.

M
ango is the most important fruit crop of India. India produces about 12.750 Mt of Mango 
from an area of 2.309 Mha with an average productivity of 5.5 mt/ha. Major producing 
states are Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Orissa & 
Maharashtra. Uttar Pradesh has 0.2712 mha under mango and the total production during 2008-
09 is 3.465 Mt with 12.8 mt/ha productivity. India ranks first in the world for mango production 
and area under cultivation. Mango is a rich source of vitamin A and has a fairly good content of 
vitamin C. Mango fruits are used for preparation of pickle, chatani, amchur, jam, squash, nectar 
and many other delicious products. 
Climate and soil: Mango can be grown from alluvial to lateritic soils except black cotton soil 
which has poor drainage. The temperature between 24 and 270C is ideal for mango cultivation.
Variety: Dashehari, Langra, Chausa, Bombay Green, Lucknow Safeda, Mallika and Amrapali.
Multiplication of genuine planting material: Mango can be propagated by veneer, wedge 
and soft wood grafting. The protected nurseries in polyhouses and use of sprinkler and drip is 
becoming common for raising humidity level, which is required for higher grafting success rate. 
Preparation of land: The land should be prepared one month before planting. The pits of 1m x 
1m x 1m size are dug. The pits are exposed for 2 to 4 weeks to kill harmful soil organisms.
Soil sterilization: Soil sterilization can be achieved through both physical and chemical means. 
Physical control measures include steam and solar energy. Chemical control methods include her-
bicides and fumigants. Soil sterilization can also be achieved by using transparent plastic mulch 
film (25 micron thickness) termed as soil solarisation.
Planting: Square and rectangular systems are popular. Before planting, pits are filled with FYM 
at the rate of 15-20 kg/plant. The grafts should be planted during July to September.
Planting density: High density (3m x 6m or 5m x 5m) planting helps increase the yield/unit 
area. Normal planting distance of mango is 8m x 8m.
Canopy Management: Training should be done after 6th month of planting. It is essential to 
space the branches properly and to help in intercultural operation. At initial branching height be-
tween 60 to 70 cm is appropriate.

Application of fertilizers: Mango should be manured with phosphorus twice in a year i.e. the 
beginning of the monsoon (June-July) and during the period of post-monsoon (September-Octo-
ber). Usually fertilizers (N and K) are applied in split doses in the month of June-July, September-
October, January-February and March-April. For adult trees (10 years or above) 1,000g N, 75g 
P2O5, 75g K2O and 100 kg FYM per year should be applied. Application of micronutrients such 
as Zinc and Boron help in cell elongation process. 
Malformation: Deblossoming at bud stage (1 cm long) alone or in combination with spray of 
200 ppm NAA lowers the number of malformed panicle.
Alternate bearing management: Use of paclobutrazol (5-10g/m canopy diameter), 3 months 
before budburst applied through soil drenching can be used for obtaining regular bearing.
Weed management: Black plastic mulch (100 micron) restricts the germination of weed seeds 
and suppresses the weed growth. The size of the film requirement for young plant is 1 m x 1 m, and 
for 8 years onwards film requirement is 2.5 m x 2.5 m around the tree.
Intercropping: In the interspaces of mango orchard, certain vegetable can be intercropped viz. 
onion, tomato, radish, carrot, ginger, turmeric, methi, cabbage, etc. Moreover, fruit crops can also 
be grown viz. papaya, pineapple, etc. for the initial 4-5 years.
Mulching: Soil drenching with paclobutrazol (5g and 10g/tree) coupled with black polythene 
mulch (100 micron) results into minimum outbreak of September to October vegetative flushing, 
giving an early and profuse flowering and a higher annual yield.

Yield and quality control: 
From a well grown up tree one can expect an average yield of 50-225 marketable fruits (50 kg) per 
plant per year.
Harvesting and post harvest management: 
From the 4th year onwards the mango fruits can be harvested at the mature green stage during 
morning hours. After harvesting fruits are graded according to their size, weight, colour and ma-
turity. Packaging of fruits should be done in corrugated fibreboard (CFB) boxes. Tissue paper and 
polythene foam paper are used for wrapping high-value fresh mangoes. Polyethylene lining has 
been found beneficial as it maintains humidity, which results in lesser shrinkage during storage. 
Dashahari treated with calcium chloride solution (4%) at sub-atmospheric pressure of 500 mm Hg

Cultivation
Selection of site 
O
rchard: Soil should be well drained and of shallow or medium depth. Deep heavy soils hav-
ing more than 60% clay contents are not suitable for citrus plantation. Nursery: Nursery 
should be located at least 500 meters away preferably on western side of the orchard to minimize 
incidence of insect pests and diseases.
Raising of citrus nursery 
Sowing of Rootstock Seeds 
Potting mixture of soil, sand and FYM or compost should be used in equal proportion (1:1:1) for 
filling of trays in primary nursery and polythene bags in secondary nursery. Before it is used for 
filling the bags/trays, the potting mixture should be solarised. For solarisation, it is spread on the 
concrete platform in 4” thick layer in the month of April – May, sufficiently moistened with water, 
then covered fully with the white polythene sheet, sealing its edges with soil. Then it should be left 
undisturbed for 11/2 to 2 months in the hot sun for solarisation. 
• 
Only certified seeds of rough lemon or Rangpur lime rootstocks should be used. 
• 
Shade dried medium size bold seeds of rootstocks should be treated with vitavax or thiram  
(@ 3g/kg seed) and sown on the raised beds or in plastic trays during September – October. 
• 
Stagnation of water in beds should be avoided otherwise roots of young plants may start root-
ing. 
• 
Uniform seedlings of medium height only be selected discarding either vigorous or the weak 
and dwarf ones while transferring to secondary nursery. Plants having hooked or bent roots 
should be discarded.

Phytophthora infected plants must be eliminated. In case of phytophthora infection drenching 
of plants with either metalaxyl MZ72 @ 2.75 g/l water or fosetyl Al @ 2.5 g/l water should be 
done. Second spray should be given after 40 days. 
• 
To prevent infestation of insect pests like citrus leaf miner and thrips plants should be sprayed 
either with acetamiprid or thiamethoxam (0.2gm/litre of water) at 10 days intervals. 
• 
The growth of plants is also affected adversely due to mite attack which can be controlled by 
spraying plans with Fenazaquin 10% EC @ 4ml/litre and wettable sulfur @ 3 g/l water, alter-
natively at 15-20 days interval. 
• 
In containerized nursery irrigation, fertilizer application, weed control, insect pest and disease 
control as well as cultural operations can be performed at ease.

Budding
• 
Budsticks should be used from the author-
ized and certified source only. 
• 
Budstick should be drawn from the last 
years flush. The stick should have pencil 
thickness, be roundish and have whitish 
longitudinal streaks.   
• 
Budstick should not be drawn from rub-
bery wood or kikarpani plants. 
• 
Budding should be performed at 10” – 12” 
height on the rootstock seedling. 
Orchard Establishment 
Pits size 
• 
Pits for planting should be 2’6” x 2’6” x 2’6” (75 x 75 x 75 cm) size and spaced at 6 x 6 m dis-
tance. 
• 
To avoid soil borne fungi or nematodes soil of roots should be removed. 
Pre-planting treatment for budlings 
• 
Roots of budling should be dipped in the solution of metalaxy1MZ72  2.75 g  for 10-15 min-
utes before planting. 
Planting of budlings
• 
While planting care should be taken that rootstock union remains at least 6” above ground. 
Manure and fertilizer application
• 
Nitrogen containing fertilizers should be applied in three equal splits in January, July and No-
vember months; phosphorus containing fertilizers in two splits in January and July months 
and Potassium containing fertilizers may be applied as singly dose in January.
• 
Surveys conducted by NRCC in Kalmeshwar, Katol, Narkhed, Saoner, Hingna and Ramtek 
tehsils of Nagpur district have revealed N deficiency in most of the orchards and P deficiency 
in leaf and soil of 50% orchards. Similarly, leaf and soil K was either at desired levels or even 
more than it. Citrus trees are nitrogen loving plants. They respond well to the applied ni-
trogenous fertilizers. During fruit development K may also be applied as it may fell deficient. 
Supplementary doses of P and K at 200 and 100 g/tree, respectively, may be included in the 
fertilizer package recommended for bearing orchard.

Leaf sampling 
For correct diagnosis of nutritional status use of correct sampling technique is very important. 
For this, it is important to know as to how many leaves, when, from which part of the plant and 
from how many trees should be sampled. In case of ambia bahar, 5-6 month old leaves in August-
October and for mrig bahar 6-8 months old leaves in December and February should be sampled. 
As far as possible, the 2nd, 3rd of 4th leaf should be picked from the tip of the non-bearing shoot, 
preferably at 1.5 – 2 m above the ground and sampled. 
Drip irrigation 
With the help of a drip system of irrigation, the required quantity of water can be provided right 
at the feeder root system. Similarly, water-soluble fertilizers and micronutrients also can be given 
through the drip system. Water requirement of irrigation depends upon age of the tree and season 
of the year (Table 1). Mulching with drip irrigation maintains moisture in soil for a longer period.

Weed control 
For effective and economic control of mono and dicotyledonous weeds, pre-emergence weedi-
cides, diuron 3 kg at the end of May and 120 days thereafter should be done. For post-emergence 
weed control, glyphosate @ 4 l/ha should be sprayed on weeds before flowering. 
Fruit drop 
Fruit drop in citrus is of serious nature which occurs at least twice; i.e. the first time when the fruits 
are little more than the marble size and the second time when the fruits are fully developed or at 
the time of colour break. This drop is very serious in the ambia bahar crop pre-harvest fruit drop in 
Nagpur Mandarin

Soil and Plant Nutrition
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
nagpur mandarin, which is called as pre-harvest fruit drop and is important from economic point 
of view to the orchardists. To control the fruit drop that occurs after fruit set, two foliar sprays of 
either 2,4-D or GA3 at 15 ppm + urea 1% and copper oxychloride2 (0.3%) at monthly intervals in 
April – May are recommended. Same spray concentration is recommended for controlling pre-
harvest drop in the months of September and October. 2,4-D and GA3 may be dissolved earlier in 
little quantity (30 – 40 ml for 1g) of some organic solvent such as alcohol or acetone before making 
the spray solution.  
Control of Insect Pests 
Blackfly (Kolshi): Nymphs of citrus blackfly attack the young flush, suck the sap and excrete 
sweet and sticky liquid, which favours rapid development of black sooty mould that covers entire 
plant surface. The process of photosynthesis is hampered greatly resulting in stunted growth of 
plants, low intensity of flowering, scarce fruiting which are insipid in taste and decline of citrus 
orchard sets. For control of blackfly two sprays of insecticides viz. acetamiprid 0.2 g/litre water 
should be given at 50% egg hatching stage that normally occurs in the II weed of July and the I 
week of December and April. One additional spray which targets the adult blackfly population 
when it is as its peak helps tremendously in controlling the pest. 
Method of spraying: Spraying should be directed at the underside of the leaf, ensuring the 
complete drenching of the tree. For proper coverage and penetration of canopy, use of power 
sprayers for spraying operation should be envisaged. Insecticides should be used alternatively for 
better results. 
Citrus psylla: Numerous young brownish nymphs of psylla are seen crawling on the young 
flush. Several dirty gray colour adults can be seen sitting in line with tails upwards. Voluminous 
desapping by the nymphs results into the drop of flush, flowers and berries. Affected branches 
dry and die-back sets in. The nymphs also excrete white crystalline powder, which invites fungal 
infestation. Psylla can be controlled by spraying acetamiprid 0.2 g/litre water twice with 10 days 
interval during the initial days of flushing. Bark eating caterpillar (Larva) are incidence of mites 
on fruits (Lalya).
Leaf miner: Serpentine mines are seen on the new leaves and also young stems are mined when 
the incidence is severe. At times death of young shoots may occur. The problem is quite serious in 
nursery and in young orchard. To control citrus leaf miners, spray either imidacloprid 5 ml (To be 
used in proper doses under guidance of an agriculture expert) and thiamethoxam 0.2g/litre water. 
Bark eating caterpillar: The pest is noticed predominantly in the older and ignored orchards. 
The hanging wooden frass and tunnel at the joint of two branches during October – April indicates 
the presence of the pest. Larva remains hidden inside the tunnel during daytime and becomes 
active in the night and feeds on the bark nearby the tunnel. This results into snapping of food sup-
ply, ultimately yellowing of leaves on the branch and its slow decline. For control of the pest the 
wooden frass should be cleaned and each tunnel should be administered with Emamectin benzo-
ate/spinosad @0.4 ml/litre water. 
Fruit sucking moth: The moth attacks the ripening fruits during late hours in the evening. The 
moth punctures it making a hole in the ripening fruit to suck the juice through which an infection 
may take place. Soon rottening starts, leading to fruit drop. Collection of dropped fruits and their

destruction followed by smoking of orchard late evening hours is suggested. For fruit fly control, 
hanging of methl eugenol (feromone) traps is an effective method to check the pest. 
Mites: Citrus rust mites attack in mrig bahar fruits especially during September – November. 
The fruit surface, particularly the side exposed to sun, is brushed and develops a big patch of dark 
brown colour – called ‘Lalya’ – only after 1 to 11/2 months. To check this, two alternating prophy-
lactic sprays at 15-20 days interval with Fenazaquin 10% EC @ 4ml/litre and wettable sulphur @ 3 
g/l water are recommended in September – October. Similarly, a phytophthora caused gummosis 
spray of  acetamiprid/thiamethoxam @0.2g/litre water at the berry stage of the ambai fruits is re-
quired to protect the fruits from unpleasant scars.  
Precautionary measures: Avoid water stagnation in orchard by providing channels along 
the slope for proper drainage. Moreover, pruning of intermingling branches to allow aeration 
and sunlight to prevent dampness in orchard are suggested. Presence of guava, pomegranate, chi-
ku, mango trees, etc. near the orchard act as the alternate hosts for blackfly, therefore, such trees 
should also be covered with insecticidal sprays. 
Control of Diseases 
Twig Blight: Drying of fruit bearing branches after harvest is a common phenomenon. Removal 
of such dried shoots along with the 2 cm lower live part, followed by a fungicidal spray i.e. copper 
oxychloride or bordeaux paste application is recommended to check twig blight. 
Gummosis, root rot and collar rot 
• 
Proper diagnosis of the disease is must. 
• 
Affected trees should be treated with metalaxyl MZ 72 @ 2.75 g or fosetyl AL @ 2.5 g/l water 
till drenching once in May – June. The second spray should be given after 40 days. The tree 
trunk and soil of the tree basin should also be sprayed/drenched. 
• 
Removal of the rotten roots, cleaning the wound on the gum-oozing trunk with sharp knife 
and then pasting with metalaxyl3 MZ 72 should be done. 
• 
Apply bordeaux paste (1 kg CuSO4 + 1 kg CaOH + 10 l water) on tree trunk upto 2 to 21/2 ft 
from ground twice i.e. before monsoon (May) and after monsoon (October). 
Precautionary measures
• 
Avoid flood irrigation 
• 
Follow the double ring system of irrigation so that water does not come in contact with 
the tree trunk. 
• 
Avoid deep ploughing under the tree to prevent damage/injury of the root system. Declin-
ing nagpur mandarin orchard rejuvenated orchard.

Pre-harvest spray of fungicide: Three pre-harvest sprays of fungicides like difenocon- 
azole @2ml/litre water at 15 day intervals till drenching prevent pre-harvest fruit drop by 54%. It 
also controls post harvest diseases upto 70%. This spray remains effective for 3 weeks at normal 
temperatures. 
Post-harvest fungicidal treatment: Fruits dipped in fungicidal solution difenoconazole for 
5 minutes are safe to minimize rotting upto 70% and can safely be stored for 3 weeks under normal 
condition. 
Precautionary measures 
• 
Follow plant protection measures to keep bearing tree disease free and healthy. 
• 
Post-harvest handling of fruits must be followed carefully to avoid any sort of injury of 
fruits. 
• 
Avoid the use of copper fungicides like b,ordeaux mixture, blitox, phytolan etc. at this 
stage. 
Rejuvenation of declining citrus orchards: Declining citrus orchards can be rejuvenated 
with the use of developed technologies and brought into productive stage. 
Harvesting 
• 
Traditionally fruits are harvested by twisting and pulling forcefully which may lead to a hole in 
the neck of the fruit or injury to the stem end. The fruits should be selectively harvested when 
¾th of the skin turns yellow. TSS: Acidity ratio should not be less than 14 in both ambia and 
mrig bahar fruits. TSS should be at least 10%. Once this stage is reached, harvesting should 
not be delayed for colour development since other fruits may turn loose. 
• 
Fruit should not be allowed to come in contact with soil and straw and also should not be 
exposed to hot sun. 
• 
Packing should be done immediately after harvesting. 
• 
For waxing on a large scale packing line can be used. Washing and waxing (stay fresh high 
shine was 2.5 g + Tebuconazole) and grading of fruits is also done automatically at the end. 
• 
Graded fruits are packed in corrugated fibre board boxes (50 x 30 x 30 cm) which are telescop-
ic with holes on both the sides covering 5% of total side portion. To keep the fruits safe from 
moisture in the store house, boxes should be externally laminated with plastic. 
• 
For small scale (1 – 1.5 tonne) and short duration (20 – 25 days) storage an evaporative cool 
chamber is recommended, costing Rs.10,000/- to 12,000/-. 
• 
For delaying or postponing the harvest of the fruits, two sprays of GA3 (100 mg / 10 litre of 
water) in 15 day intervals at the point of the colour break are recommended. 
• 
For long duration cold storage, a temperature of 6-7 0 C and humidity 90-95% is desirable. 
In such a situation, citrus fruits should not be stored for more than 45 days. To avoid chilling 
injury, care should be taken that the temperature does not go down upto 40 C.

1.	 Dark coloured soils are more fertile compared to light coloured soils. Neutral pH is more 
suitable for majority of crops. Lime is used for amending acid soils and gypsum for alkaline 
soil.
2.	 Soil testing is essential for judicious application of fertilisers based on nutrients status in the 
soils.
3.	 Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) practices are useful for efficient, economic and sus-
tainable production.

3.3. Crop pest and their importance
P
est is any organism which is detrimental to crop 
production. Pest cause damage to the plant to 
the extent of 30 - 90 per cent, sometimes it even 
causes total loss. Pest includes insects, diseases and 
weeds. Non insect pest includes nematodes, snails 
and rodents.
Insect is any of many small invertebrate animals 
having a segmented body and three pairs of legs and 
usually two pairs of wings. Some insects are benefi-
cial and some are harmful to agriculture. 
What is the difference between  
complete and incomplete metamor-
phosis in insects?
Incomplete and complete metamorphosis differs 
in the number of life cycle stages that insects go 
through during their transformation from egg to 
adult. The complete metamorphosis has 4 life cycle 
stages and an incomplete metamorphosis has 3 life 
cycle stages.
Complete metamorphosis
Complete metamorphosis has four distinct life cy-
cle stages: egg, larva, pupa and adult.
Examples of insects that go through complete 
metamorphosis are butterflies, silkworms, meal-
worms and ladybugs. The larva can be worm-like 
even though the six legs are still visible. The larva 
form moths and butterflies are called caterpillars. 
Maggots are the larval stage of flies. The larvae eat 
constantly and grow rapidly. A hard, protective case 
forms around the larva at pupa stage. The pupa 
stage for a butterfly is called a chrysalis. The pupa 
stage for moth is called cocoon.
Incomplete metamorphosis
Incomplete metamorphosis has three life cycle stag-
es: egg, nymph and adult. The nymph looks similar 
too but is a smaller version of the adult. The nymph 
is also wingless. Examples are grasshoppers, cock-
roaches, ants and praying mantids.
3.4. Life stages of insects
• 
EGG is the initial stages of the insect. Normally 
an insect lays at least 30 to 300.
• 
Egg hatch into LARVA or worms. Larva is the 
I. Pest Management

72
Plant Protection
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
damaging stage of insect to any crop. This stage 
is normally seen in the field.
• 
PUPA is an inactive stage preparing itself to de-
velop to an adult.
• 
Mostly ADULTS insects are harmless but many 
bugs and beetles are harmful to plants.
How the damage is visible?
• 
The larva eats the leaf, fruits or the whole plant 
parts. Hence the damage is visible. 
• 
Some insects scrape the plant tissues. They also 
cut the growing parts. Beetles, bugs, thrips and 
hoppers usually suck the sap from the plants 
and growing parts, affecting the healthy plant.
• 
Not at all. HONEY BEES are also insects which 
help in pollination (brings pollen from one 
plant to another), thereby, increasing the yield.

They also provide us valuable HONEY and 
other products. Another example of “friendly” 
insects are SILK WORMS.
• 
NATURAL ENEMIES are insects that are ben-
eficial to man since they feed from the egg or 
larvae and pupae of crop pest. They are called 
biological control agents. Examples are the 
trichogramma parasite for sugarcane borers, 
crub of green lacewing and ladybird beetle.
3.5. Insect classification
I
nsects can be classified into 3 groups, depending 
on their behaviour in the farm such as
• 
Pests
• 
Beneficial insects
• 
Neutral insects
Pest: Whether an insect species is a pest or not 
depends on the situation. This means that a cer-
tain insect could be a pest in one situation but not 
in another situation. For example, the caterpillars 
of diamondback moth feed on cabbage and other 
plants of the cruciferae family. A farmer who grows 
cauliflower will therefore consider it a pest. Yet, for 
a farmer who grows potatoes or bananas, the dia-
mondback moth is a neutral insect. When there is 
nothing to feed it will not even occur. In a paddy 
crop, black gram is a weed/pest since it is growing 
unnecessarily. In a black gram field, cow pea is a 
weed since it can grow. Pest will occur only if there 
is a host.
Beneficial insects
Some insects are beneficial to the farmer, because 
they are the natural enemies of harmful insects. 
Predators feed on other insects and hence control 
the pest. For example, the assassin bug kills caterpil-
lars and ladybird beetles feed on aphids. Some oth-
er insects are beneficial as they help in pollination 
of plants, e.g. honey bees. There are commercially 
beneficial insects such as silkworm, which produces 
silk.
Neutral insects
A neutral insect is neither a pest nor beneficial. Yet 
again, it really depends on the context. A mosquito 
in the rice field can be considered as neutral insect. 
 
3.6. How to control pest
Natural control
Understanding insect life cycle: Insects mul-
tiply in large numbers. However the survival rate 
is very less as the nature maintains insect popula-
tion. Factors like extreme temperature, heavy rains, 
heavy wind, water stagnation, birds, lizards, spiders, 
animals, other insects and diseases control the pest. 
Natural barriers like sea, river, lake, mountains, etc. 
prevent movement and spread of pest.
Mechanical control: Some of the recommended 
practices are
• 
Removal of affected parts 
• 
Collection and destruction of insects 
• 
Drying of seeds
• 
Tar coating of trees to protect from termites 
• 
Provision of barriers to prevent the entry of 
pests like green house / screen house, covering 
of pomegranate fruits with butter paper, etc.
• 
Clipping off the withered shoots
Agronomical methods: Recommended culti-
vation practices are as follows. 
• 
Summer ploughing:  Opens up the soil and ex-
poses pest to hot sun and predators. 
• 
Trap crop: Is growing the most favoured crop of 
the insect along with the main crop. The insect 
feeds from the trap crop and the main crop re-
mains not unaffected. Growing of resistant va-
rieties also prevents the pest attack.
Main Crop
Trap Crop
Tomato
Marigold
Cotton
Okra, Castor, Onion, Garlic
Maize
Sorghum
• 
Mixed cropping: Is growing more than one crop.
• 
Inter cropping: Growing another crop along 
with main crop, which increases the population 
of natural enemy.
Main Crop
Intercrop
Cabbage
Tomato, mustard
Cotton
Black gram, green gram
Maize
Sorghum
• 
Crop Rotation: Is growing of different crops in 

74
Plant Protection
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
sequence instead of one single crop.
• 
Keeping the fields clean: Managing the weeds 
which provides home for pests, treating the 
seeds with pesticides, growing the crops in sea-
sons where pest incidence is less, application of 
correct dose of fertilizer at correct time, opti-
mum use of water are some of the agronomical 
methods to control pests.
Pest load and monitoring
Pest monitoring: Is the practice of examining 
the crop to know whether the pest has affected the 
crop and the extent of damage to decide whether to 
spray the pesticide or not.
Economic Threshold Level (ETL): ETL is 
the pest population density at which the control 
measure has to be taken up to prevent the pest from 
reaching economic injury level.
ETL for some of the crops are as follows
• 
Brown plant hopper in paddy - nymph or adult 
hopper 5-10 / hill 
• 
Leaf miner in groundnut: 2 larvae / 10 plant or 
20-30% plant infestation
• 
Whitefly in cotton: 5-10 adults / leaf or 20 
nymphs / leaf
Biological control methods: There are several 
biological agents that controls pest such as
• 
The insect that kills another insect by living 
inside its body is called Parasite. There is egg, 
larval and pupal parasites. Trichogramma is an 
egg parasite used commercially on sugarcane 
borers. 
• 
Predators are insects that eat other insects. For 
example, the Ladybird Beetle, dragonfly, dam-
selfly, etc. Insects are also affected by many 
diseases. Some are fungal, bacterial and viral. 
Verticillium, a fungal agent, bacillus, a bacterial 
agent, and NPV (Virus) are commercially used.
Physical Control 
• 
An age old practice is to mix pulses with red 
earth to protect pulses from pulse beetle. 
• 
Drying of seeds in hot sun and using radiation 
are some of the physical control methods.   
Traps
• 
Light Trap: Most of the insects are attracted to-
wards light. This principle is used to monitor 
and control pests.
• 
Pheromone Trap:  Insects are trapped using the 
scent of one sex. This is commonly used for the 
control of cotton bollworms. 
• 
Yellow Sticky Traps: Some of the small sucking 
insects are attracted by yellow colour. Hence 
yellow coloured containers smeared with sticky 
materials are kept inside the field to attract 
sucking insect.
Chemical control
Manual pesticide spraying	
• 
Pesticide application is the last resort to control 
pests. 
• 
Pesticides to be selected carefully to control the 
pests. 
• 
Dose and spraying equipments should be se-
lected carefully.
• 
Get the correct recommendation from the ex-
tension worker. 
• 
Understand the difference between chemical 
name and trade name. Trade name is the trader 
given name but the chemical name is originated 
based on the chemical ingredient.
Botanicals: are plant origin pesticides like neem 
based formulations. We can also use neem seed 
kernal extract or neem oil along with soap as pes-
ticides. Commercial botanicals are available in the 
market and botanicals can be prepared, which cost 
less and are eco friendly.

For example, Neem Seed Kernal Extract (NSKE) 
5%, Gronim, Achook and Neemazal.
3.7. Pesticides
P
esticides are the chemicals used to control pests. 
The pesticides can be broadly classified into 
three groups based on how they act on insects.
Contact and stomach poison: When insect 
comes into contact or when the insect eats the pesti-
cide sprayed parts, it gets killed. Contact and stom-
ach poison is used for controlling larvae that feed 
on leaves. Examples include Flubendamide. Some 
of the pesticides derived from plants also have con-
tact action, for example pyrethrum, sabadilla, etc.  
Systemic poison: When the chemical is sprayed 
on the plant, it is absorbed by the plant and trans-
ferred to the entire plant system. Sucking type of 
pest like aphids, leafhoppers thrips suck the sap 
from plants. This kind of sucking pests can be con-
trolled by systemic poison like Imidacloprid (To 
be used with caution), flubendamide, acetamiprid, 
thiamethoxam, etc. 
1)	
Fumigant: Forms vapour and acts on breath-
ing system of the insects. When insects breathe 
it, they get killed.  Examples include, hydrogen 
cyanamide, sulfuryl fluoride, etc.  
Insecticides are poisons which cannot be used di-
rectly. They need to be used as per directions given 
on the container or as per the recommendation of 
extension workers. Insecticides are available in dif-
ferent forms of which some are:
i)	
Dust (D): Poisons are mixed with gypsum, 
talc or clay so that it can be used in powder form. 
There is no need to mix with water.
ii)	 Wettable Powders (WP/WDP):Mixed with 
dry fillers with sticking agents but these dry 
powders can be mixed with water.
iii)	 Granules (G): Dry formulations in which 
poisons are mixed with calcium or gypsum in 
granulated form. Main merit of this formulation 
is handling will be easy, it is not carried away by 
the wind and it is less toxic to plants.
iv)	 Liquid forms, Soluble Liquids (SL), Emulsifi-
able Concentrates (EC), and Soluble Concentrates 
(SC): Liquid forms of pesticides. Since the pesti-
cides are directly soluble in water, they are mixed 
with organic solvents, EC formulations disperse 
in water easily as they are mixed with emulsifi-
ers.
v)	
Fumigants: are the poisons in gas form. 
Normally it is used to fumigate godowns, grains, 
storage rooms and ships even for rat control. 
vi)	 Poison baits: Poisons mixed with food mate-
rial. The latter acts as attractants. Baits are exclu-
sively used to control rats. As the rats are more 
sensitive, pre baiting is necessary.

(IPM)
"I
PM is a sustainable approach for managing 
pests by combining biological, cultural, physi-
cal and chemical tools in a way that minimizes eco-
nomic, health, and environmental risks." 
3.11. Some insecticidal materials for 
common household use
Kerosene emulsion
This is a contact insecticide useful against many 
sucking insects. Finely divide 500 g of ordinary bar 
soap and dissolve it in 4.5 litres of boiling water. 
Cool and add 9 litres of kerosene. The mixture is 
then vigorously agitated until the oil is completely 
emulsified. The stock solution can be diluted with 
15-20 times of water before spraying.
Tobacco decoction
This is very effective for controlling aphids infesting 
vegetable crops. Tobacco decoction can be prepared 
by steaming 500 gm of tobacco in 4.5 litres of water 
for 24 hours. Then, 320 gm of ordinary sliced bar 
soap is dissolved separately in another vessel. The 
soap solution is added to tobacco decoction and the 
stock solution is diluted 6 - 7 times.
Neem seed suspension
This is very effective as a repellent against locusts 
and grasshoppers. Kernels of mature neem fruits 
should be crushed into a coarse powder. For obtain-
ing 0.1% concentration, 1 g of powdered neem seed 
is required for a litre of water. The required quantity 
of the coarse powder should be put in a small bag 
of muslin cloth and dipped in water contained in 
a bucket and squeezed till the water becomes light 
brownish. This has to be sprayed on crops.
The latest registered chemicals are available in www.

3.12. Disease 
D
isease is an impairment of the normal state 
of a plant that interrupts or modifies its vital 
functions. All species of plants, wild and cultivated 
alike are subject to disease. Although each species 
is susceptible to characteristic diseases, these are, in 
each case, relatively few in number. The occurrence 
and prevalence of plant diseases vary from season 
to season, depending on the presence of the patho-
gen, environmental conditions, and the crops and 
varieties grown. Some plant varieties are particu-
larly subject to outbreaks of diseases.
Disease of crops and their importance 
• 
Plant become diseased when it is continuously 
disturbed by some causal agent including an 
abnormal process that disrupts the plants.
• 
There are more than 80,000 plant diseases.
• 
Diseases reduce the yield of the crops and 
sometimes lead to disaster e.g. late blight of po-
tato, Panama of banana, etc.
• 
Managing outbreak of diseases is challenge to 
the farmer.
Causes of plant disease
Infectious diseases: caused due to fungi, bacte-
ria, viruses, nematodes, etc.
Non-infectious diseases: caused due to unfa-
vourable extraneous condition such as scorching 
sunlight, high temperature, moisture stress or defi-
ciency of micronutrients, pH, heavy metal toxicity, 
atmospheric pollution, etc.
3.13. The disease cycle
T
he main events of stages comprising the disease 
cycle include the following: production and 
dissemination of the primary inoculum, primary 
infection, growth and development of the patho-
gen, secondary infection and over wintering.
The primary inoculum is the part of the pathogen 
(that is, bacterial or fungal spores or fungal myce-
lium) that over winters (over-seasons) and causes 
the first infection of the season, known as primary 
infection. In general, the greater the amount of in-
oculum and the nearer it is to its host, the greater 
the potential for a disease epidemic.
Dissemination refers to the spread or dispersal of 
the pathogen from an inoculum source to a host. 
Dissemination can occur by wind, splashing rain, 
insects, infested pruning tools, infected or infested 
transplants, and other means. Spread can occur 
over short distances within the tree canopy or from 
distant sources. 
Primary infection occurs when the pathogen comes 
into contact with a susceptible host under favour-
able environmental conditions. Pathogens pene-
trate the surface of a plant directly or enter through 
wounds or natural openings. 
Growth and development of a pathogen usually oc-
curs on or within infected plant tissue. 
Secondary infection results from spores or cells 
produced following primary infection or from 
other secondary infections. The secondary infec-
tion cycle can be repeated many times during the 
growing season. The number of cycles is dependent 
on the biology of the pathogen and its host and the 
duration of environmental conditions needed for 
infection. 
Over wintering or over seasoning is the ability of 
a pathogen to survive from one growing season to 
the next. Pathogens of apple survive the winter in a 
number of different ways. 
For a plant disease to occur, a susceptible host, a 
pathogen (casual agent), and favourable environ-
mental conditions must be present and interact 
with one another. If any one of these requirements 
is not met, a plant disease will not occur. At pre-
sent, our ability to manipulate the environment is 
limited to only a few practices such as pruning to 
promote drying, bedding to improve soil drainage, 
and scheduling of irrigation. Severe disease out-
breaks can be prevented by manipulating the host - 
through the use of resistant cultivars - and the path-
ogen -- through cultural practices and fungicidal or 
bactericidal sprays.

Seed-rot, root-rot, pre emergence and-
post emergence damping-off.
Fungicide seed treatments help con-
trol seed rots and some pre emergence 
damping off.  However, an additional 
soil treatment of fungicide must be 
used to control root-rots and most 
damping-off.  In addition,  producers  
must follow all other recommended 
cotton production practices to de-

these practices include use of correct 
planting equipment and date of plant-
ing, good seed bed preparation, cor-
rect use of herbicides and insecticides 
and use of high germinating seed.
2. Fusari-
um wilt
Plants become stunted, yellowed, fol-
lowed by defoliation.  Yellowing first 
occurs around leaf edges and advances 
inward.  Cross sections of infected 
stems usually reveals a brown Discol-
oration which is more intense in outer 
layers of tissue.  Infected plants fruit 
earlier and produce smaller boll.
Reduce nematode population.  Crop 
rotations. Use resistant varieties.
3. Boll rot
Boll rots usually first appear as water 
soaked spots.  Later, as infection-
spreads, bolls turn black and may be-
covered with a moldy fungus growth.
Badly infected bolls may drop from-
plant.
Avoid excessive rates of nitrogen.  
Practice skip-row planting.  Timely de-
foliation will reduce boll rots.  Reduce 
insects which injure bolls.  Growth 
regulators such as Pix can be used ef-
fectively to reduce boll rots.

decline
Symptoms vary with the cause of 
the malady. The affected trees do not 
always die completely, but remain in a 
state for decandance and unproductive 
for a number of years.
Some-times they may suddenly wilt 
and die in a day or two. In early stages, 
Symptoms are restricted to a few 
limbs, but eventually the whole tree is 
involved. Trees show sparse mottling 
leaves, stunted growth, sickly appear-
ance. Midrib and lateral veins of old, 
mature leaves turn yellow with in-
terveinal areas along the veins showing 
diffuse yellowing.
Leaves may turn yellow and are shed 
with the onset of summer or autumn 
and the die-back of twigs starts. Dead 
shoots stand out prominently and 
may be found dead right down to the 
main trunk. The entire tree bears short 
twigs carrying narrow small leaves 
on their lower portion.  Subsequent 
secondary growth consists of short, 
upright small, weak shoots showing 
a variety of discolouration of leaves. 
Often these leaves have green veins of 
green blotches. Occasionally, small, 
circular, green spots appear on yel-
low tissue on leaves. The die-back of 
weak shoots continues. There is exces-
sive flowering, but the fruits are not 
carried to maturity. The fruits show 
distinct sun-blotching. The feeder root 
system becomes depleted, roots turn 
black and sometimes are covered with 
rotting bark. Either only a few trees or 
entire orchard may be affected.
Good cultural practices, improvement 
in soil fertility and drainage, control 
of insect pests, nematodes, etc. may 
be useful to minimize the incidence of 
decline. Use of resistant rootstocks and 
certified budwood for propagation is 
also useful.

3.15 Concept of Seed Treatment
T
he concept of seed treatment is the use and 
application of biological and chemical agents 
that control or contain primary soil and seed borne 
infestation of insects and diseases which pose dev-
astating consequences to crop production and im-
proving crop safety leading to good establishment of 
healthy and vigorous plants resulting better yields. 
The benefits of seed treatment are as follows:
• 
Increased germination
• 
Ensures uniform seedling emergence.
• 
Protect seeds or seedlings from early season 
diseases and insect pests improving crop emer-
gence and its growth.
• 
Use of plant growth hormones may enhance 
crop performance during the growing season.
• 
Rhizobium inoculation enhances the nitrogen fixing 
capability of legume crops, and their productivity. 
• 
Improved plant population and thus higher 
productivity.

3.16. Nematode management
N
ematodes are thread-like roundworms in-
visible to the naked eye. Species parasitic on 
plants attack roots and other plant parts, causing 
stunting and yield reduction. Nematode-infected 
plants are not only weakened but their root systems 
are more susceptible to secondary infections by 
fungi or bacteria. 
Correct identification is the first step when a nem-
atode problem is suspected. The second step is to 
determine whether populations are high enough to 
threaten the crop. Root knot nematodes, the most 
common pathogenic nematodes in vegetables, can-
not penetrate roots when soil temperatures are 
below 50 degrees F, and will not reproduce when 
soil temperatures are below 58 degrees F. Their re-
productive rate is slower at cooler temperatures, so 
populations build up more slowly. Thus, cool sea-
son crops are less likely to be damaged. E.g., early 
spring potatoes, are rarely damaged by nematodes.
Nematode management practices
Isolation: Once a nematode problem is confirmed, 
affected areas and plants should be isolated because 
transplants, machinery and irrigation water can all 
spread nematode infections. From initially small-
infested areas, nematodes can spread across a field 
at a rate of 3 feet per year.
Crop rotation and cover crops: Crops suscep-
tible to root knot nematodes include all cole crop 
species, beans, cucumber, muskmelon, watermelon, 
bendi, potato, sweet potato and tomato. All pota-
toes are susceptible to nematodes except for a few 
cultivars resistant to the golden nematode. 

86
Plant Protection
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
Rotation to non-host crops such as corn, cucurbits, 
potatoes and tomatoes is an effective control for the 
cyst nematode. But is less likely to control the root 
knot nematode because of its wider host range. All 
species of Meloidogyne are called 'root knot' nema-
tode but each species has a different host range, 
causing confusion over which crops or cultivars are 
resistant or tolerant to which species of root knot 
nematode. Rotations to non-host crops for more 
than a year reduce populations below damaging 
levels but will not eliminate them. 
Cover crops: significantly reduce subsequent 
damage to crop. 
Increasing Soil Organic Matter: Higher soil 
organic matter content protects plants against nem-
atodes by increasing soil water-holding capacity 
and enhancing the activity of naturally-occurring 
biological organisms that compete with nematodes 
in the soil. 
Fallow Period: A fallow period of two years 
with no susceptible plants in the field decreases 
nematode populations. Marigold as a rotation 
crop suppress nematodes. 
Plant resistance: Nematode resistant cultivars 
may be used to reduce the incidence of nematodes

3.17. Control measures - Tips for the 
farmers
• 
Correct identification of disease in your farm is 
essential for effective control of disease.
• 
With little experience, you can identify the dis-
ease. However you can contact agricultural of-
ficers of your area along with disease specimen 
and seek their help in identifying the disease.
• 
You can also give disease-affected plant parts to 
the Agri clinics for clinical test before under-
taking control measures.
• 
Follow Integrated Diseases Management such 
as host plant resistance, agronomic practices, 
judicious use of fungicides, pesticides for vec-
tor control, bio-pesticides for pathogen control 
etc., as indicated below. 
3.18. Integrated disease management 
practices in the field
• 
Select varieties and hybrids resistant to the 
most common or economically important dis-
eases in consultation with agricultural officers 
of your area.
For  example:
• 
Plant only good quality, disease-free seed hav-
ing good germination. E.g. Cotton seed hav-
ing above 80% germination will have vigorous 
growth and will not suffer from infection of soil 
borne diseases
• 
Use seed-treatment with fungicides to control 
diseases.
• 
Plant when soil temperature and moisture are 
most favourable for specific crop. E.g: If the 
farmers take up sowing of cotton during the 
warmer temperature (>65 F), there will be bet-
ter germination and growth.
• 
Avoid planting the same crop in a field year af-
ter year. E.g.: 
I) Growing paddy in the Veriticillium wilt in-
fested field will reduce the incidence of micro-
bial population in the soil.
II) Growing Chrysanthemum will inhibit the 
growth of the Veriticillium in the soil.
• 
Incorporate the crop residues of the previous 
crop by tilling well before planting season.  E.g. 
Disease affected plants should be burnt imme-
diately.
• 
Choose right sowing time and maintain ap-
propriate plant population by adopting recom-
mended spacing.
• 
Apply a balanced fertilizers based on a soil test. 
E.g.: Potassium deficiency leads to susceptibil-
ity of Alternaria leaf spot.
• 
Apply recommended amount of Farmyard Ma-
nures/compost at regular intervals and main-
tain soil-organic matter content.  E.g.: Over 
dose of chemical fertilisers lead to more vegeta-
tive growth and more disease.
• 
Enrich soil with beneficial micro-organisms 
like Trichoderma.
• 
Keep the land weed free. Weeds can serve as 
alternate hosts for pathogens and helps disease 
development. 
• 
Timing and duration of irrigation should match 
the crop and water requirement without allow-
ing for excess water. E.g.: Excessive irrigation 
favour soil borne pathogen
• 
Maintain insect population below ETL to re-
duce the incident of disease transfer by insects. 
• 
Regular crop monitoring is essential for effec-
tive disease management.
• 
Use bio-pesticide as far as possible to control 
disease. Chemical may be used only as last re-
sort.

3.19.	Weed and its relevance in crop 
production 
• 
Weeds are the plants, which grow where they 
are not wanted 
• 
Weeds compete with crops for water, soil nutri-
ents, light and space 
• 
Weeds reduce crop yields to the extent of up to 
50 percent
• 
Critical period of weed competition is approxi-
mately 1/3rd of the duration of the crop
Characteristics of weeds: “One year 
seeding, seven years weeding”
• 
Produces larger number of seeds compared to 
crops. E.g.: Amaranthus retroflexus produces 
1,96,405 seeds/plant, whereas wheat & rice pro-
duces only 90 to 100 seeds/plant
• 
Most of the weed seeds are small in size 
• 
Easy and diverse means of seed dispersion 
• 
Seeds germinate earlier and grow faster
• 
Flower earlier and mature ahead of the crop 
• 
Germinate under tough conditions, season 
bound 
• 
Seeds are dormant for long period and germi-
nate during suitable season
• 
Good viability for years 
• 
Tolerate moisture stress
• 
Possess stronger and deeper root system
Effect of weed competition on crop 
growth and yield
• 
Crop suffers from nutritional deficiency
• 
Growth is reduced
• 
Water requirement will be more
• 
Lowers the input response
• 
Pest and disease incidence will be more
• 
Yield is affected
• 
Cost of production will increase

3.22. Control measures of weeds
Principles of weed control
• 
Prevention
• 
Eradication
• 
Control
• 
Management
a) Preventive weed control
• 
Avoid using crop that are infested with weed 
seeds for sowing
• 
Avoid adding weeds to the manure pits
• 
Nursery or planting material should be free 
from weeds
• 
Keep irrigation channels, fence-lines and un-
cropped areas clean
• 
Constantly look for weed, destroy the weeds 
then and there
• 
Use good quality certified seeds, which are free 
from weed seeds 
• 
Use pre-emergence herbicides to prevent ger-
mination of weeds
b) Eradication (complete removal): Weeds are 
killed or completely removed from a given area, will 
not reappear unless it is introduced again. However, 
• 
It is very difficult
• 
Involves high cost
• 
Can be used in green houses and nurseries
c) Control: Weeds growth is restricted and killed 
when necessary so that it does not affect crop 
growth.
d) Weed management: Managing the population 
of weeds using all possible methods. 
(i) Mechanical method: 
• 
Tillage: Using plough or disc, weeds are re-
moved from soil and exposed to sunlight. 
• 
Hoeing: Using hand hoe, annual and bienni-
als are completely removed. 
• 
Hand weeding: Either by physical removal or 
pulling out of weeds by hand or using some 
implements. 
• 
Digging: Advisable in the case of perennial 
weeds.
• 
Using sickle: Top portion of weeds are re-
moved using sickle, thereby weeds seed pro-
duction is controlled. 
• 
Burning: Burning is often an economical and 
practical means of controlling weeds but not 
always possible in crop production field.
• 
Flooding: Kills weeds by reducing oxygen to 
plant growth. This is possible only under gar-
den land or wetland condition.
Merits of mechanical method
• 
Oldest and effective method
• 
Safe method for environment
• 
High skill is not necessary
• 
Weeding is possible in between plants 
• 
Deep rooted weeds can be controlled effec-
tively
Demerits of mechanical method
• 
Labour and time consuming
• 
Possibility of crop damage 
• 
Requires ideal moisture
• 
Costly 
ii)	 Cultural weed control
• 
Summer ploughing: Is done immediately af-
ter summer showers. This exposes weeds to 
hot sun. 
• 
Field preparation: Makes the field weed free 
by constant removal. 
• 
Select crop that can compete better with 
weeds like cowpea, sudan gross, sorghum are 
good competitors. Fast growing crops sup-
presses the weed effectively. 
• 
Maintenance of optimum plant population: 
Adequate plant population covers the land 
and, hence, growth of the weed will be dif-
ficult. Close row crops are better than wide 
row.
• 
Crop rotation: Minimize the dominance of 
particular weed in the cropping system.
• 
Growing of intercrops: Inter cropping cov-
ers the land quickly and reduce growth of 
the weeds. E.g,: Growing crop such as cow-
pea/ soybean, etc. in wide spaced crops like 
maize/pigeon pea/sugar cane, etc.
• 
Mulching: Mulch is a protective covering 
of material maintained on soil surface. It 
has smothering effect and reduces the weed 
growth. Mulching can be done through de-
gradable farm waste or through plastic sheets. 
In case of plastic, black is the most popular 
colour used in commercial horticulture crop 
production, especially for weed control.
• 
Solarisation: Done by covering the pre soaked 
field with transparent polythene cover, which 
increases the temperature by 5 – 10 ºC.

Plant Protection
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture

• 
Stale seedbed: Weeds are allowed to germi-
nate and non-residual herbicide is sprayed 
to kill the young weed seedlings.  
• 
Blind tillage: Ploughing after sowing of the 
crop and before plants emerge. Normally 
seed drills are used under rainfed condition 
for this purpose. 
• 
Crop management practices: Vigorous and 
fast growing crop varieties for better compe-
tition with weeds. 
Merits of cultural method
• 
Low cost 
• 
Easy to adopt
• 
Less technical skill is sufficient
• 
No damage to crops
• 
Effective weed control
Demerits of cultural method
• 
Time taking and difficult 
• 
Perennial and problematic weeds can not be 
controlled
iii) 	Biological weed control: Natural enemy 
of a weed plant is used to control the weed 
Examples:   
• 
Zygogramma biolorata for control of Par-
thenium 
• 
Hirsch – Manniella spinicaudata is a rice 
root nematode to control most upland rice 
weeds
• 
Azolla in rice
Advantages
• 
Eco friendly
• 
Easy
• 
Low cost
Disadvantages 
• 
They may have alternate host or switching 
over to alternate host
• 
Multiplication of bio agent in many cases is 
difficult 
iv) 	Chemical Weed Control: Herbicides are 
chemicals used to control weeds. 
Merits
• 
Recommended for adverse soil and climatic 
conditions
• 
Applied even before weeds emerge and 
make the environment weed free
• 
Suitable for all types of crops
• 
Controls the targeted weeds only
• 
Controls many perennial weed species
• Cost effective compared to labour
Demerits
• 
Pollutes the environment
• 
Affects the soil 
• 
Herbicide drift affects adjoining field
• 
Requires minimum technical knowledge 
• 
Leaves residual effects
• 
Some herbicides are costly
• 
No suitable herbicides are available for 
mixed and inter-cropping system
3.23. Classification of herbicides
Method 
of appli-
cation
Soil herbicides; e.g:  Fluchloralin
Foliar herbicide: e.g. Glyphosate
Mode of 
action
Selective herbicide: Kills only weeds. 
Non selective herbicide: Kills the entire 
vegetation.
Mobility
Contact herbicide; Kills when comes 
in contact with plant. 
Translocated herbicide: poison moves 
from treated parts to untreated part: 
Eg. Glyphosate
Time of 
applica-
tion
Pre-plant: Before sowing or along 
sowing 
Eg. Glyphosate for Hariyali, Basalin 
for groundnut
Pre emergence: Before weeds 
germinate;Eg. Thiobencarb
Post emergence: applied after weeds 
germinate 
i)	
Eg.  Bispyribac Sodium.

Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
Formula-
tions
Emulsifiable Concentrate (EC): Liquid 
form. 
Wettable powders: Poisons mixed with 
inert carrier.  
Granules (G) poisons are mixed with 
granular forms. 
Water Soluble Concentrates (WSC) 
forms are also available 
3.24. Methods of application
• 
Spraying
• 
Broadcasting
Foliar application
Blanket spray: Both crop and weed is sprayed 
with weedicide.
Directed spray: Application of herbicides on 
weeds only avoiding crop using hood.
Eg: Spraying glyphosate1 in between rows of tapioca 
using hood to control Hariyali.
Protected spray: Crops are covered and herbi-
cides are sprayed on weeds. This method is expen-
sive.
Spot treatment: Applied only where weeds are 
present. 
3.25. Control of parthenium (peren-
nial weed)
• 
Manual removal and destruction of Partheni-
um plants before flowering using hand glouse/ 
machineries (or)
• 
Uniform spraying of sodium chloride 200g + 2 
ml soap oil/litre of water (or)
• 
Spraying of 2,4-D sodium salt 8 g or glypho-
sate10 ml + 20g ammonium sulphate + 2 ml 
soap solution/litre of water before flowering 
(or)
• 
Post-emergence application of metribuzin 3 g / 
litre of water under non-crop situation.
• 
Raising competitive plants like Cassia serecea 
and Abutilon indicum on fallow lands to re-
place Parthenium (or)
• 
Biological control by Mexican beetle, fungal 
pathogen and nematodes
3.26. Control of perennial weeds in 
orchards
P
erennial weeds like Cyperus rotundus, cynodon 
dactylon, etc. in orchards can be controlled ef-
fectively by spraying glyphosate1 at 2.5 to 5.0 L ha-1 
dissolved in 500 liters of water. Falling of the spray 
fluid on young fruit plant foliage should be avoided. 
Second spray is required when there is re-growth of 
weed. (Cost Rs.700/- to 1400 ha).
3.27. Precautions while spraying the 
herbicides
• 
Select right kind of herbicide for right kind of 
crop and spray. Any mistake in choosing the 
herbicide may result in loss of total crop. 
• 
Dosage should be accurate and good quality of 
water should be used.
• 
Use always correct nozzle for spraying. Spray-
ing should be done from front to backwards. 
(We should not step into the sprayed field for a 
minimum of 3 days).
• 
The soil should have sufficient moisture for ef-
fective control. 
• 
For paddy, a thin film of water should be main-
tained for 3 days and it should not be drained.

S
ometimes involves mixing of two or more her-
bicides used for effective and economical weed 
control at reduced dosage. 
Two types of mixtures available are:
1.	 Tank mixtures made with the desired propor-
tion of herbicides before application.  eg: An-
ilophos + Bispyribac Sodium – Rice 
2.	 Ready mix – formulated by the manufacturer. 
Ready mix available in the world market eg: 
Bispyribac Sodium+Glyphosate.
Mixing Ammonium sulphate with glyphosate in-
creases the efficiency where nitrogen increases the 
translocation.
3.30. Integrated Weed Management

3.31. Beneficial Effects of Weeds or 
Economic Uses of Weeds
S
everal weeds have been put to certain economic 
uses since ages. Some of the examples are:
• 
Typha and Saccharum sp is used for making 
ropes and thatch boards.
• 
Chicory Cichorium intybus roots are used for 
adding flavor to coffee powder.
• 
Amaranthus viridis, Chenopodium album and 
Portulaca sp. are used as leafy vegetable. 
• 
Hariyali 
grass 
(Cynodon 
dactylon) 
and 
Cenchrus Ciliaris, Dichanthium Annulatum  
andEclipta alba weeds of grass land serve as 
food for animals.
• 
Weeds act as alternate host for predators and 
parasites of insect pests, which feed on the 
weeds.  For example, Trichogramma chilonis 
feed upon eggs of caster semi looper, which 
damage the castor plants. E.g. Commelina sp 
(Copper), Eichornia crassipes (Copper Zinc, 
lead and cadmium in water bodies.
• 
Several species of weeds like Tephorsia purpu-
rea and Croton sparsiflora in South India are 
used as green manures, whereas Eichornia cras-
sipes and Pistia stratiotes are used for compost-
ing. 
• 
Argemone Mexicana is used for reclamation of 
alkali soils. 
• 
Some weeds have medicinal properties and 
used to cure snake bite (Leucas aspera), gastric 
troubles (Calotropis procera), skin disorders 
(Argemone mexicana) and jaundice (Phyllan-
thus nirur ) and Striga Orobanchioides to con-
trol diabetes. 
• 
Agarbathis (Cyperus rotundus), aromatic oils, 
(Andropogan sp & Simbopogon sp) are pre-
pared from weeds. 
• 
Air pollution determined by wild mustard and 
chickweed respectively.
• 
Aquatic weeds are useful in paper, pulp and 
fiber industry. 
• 
Chenopodium album is used as mulch to re-
duce evaporation losses, whereas Agropyron 
repens (quack grass) is used to control soil ero-
sion because of its prolific root system. 
• 
Weeds like Lantana camara, Amaranthus vir-
idis, Chenopodium Albu and Eichhornia cras-
sipes are used for beautification.
• 
Agropyron repense are used for soil conserva-
tion, whereas Dicanthium Annulatum are used 
as stabilizing field bunds. 
• 
Opuntia Dellini is used as biological fence.    
3.34. Lessons Learnt
1.	 Not all insects are harmful. Farmers need 
to identify beneficial and harmful insects.
2.	 Summer ploughing, growing trap crops, 
adopting mixed  cropping, intercropping, 
crop rotation and keeping the field clean 
are the important agronomical practices 
farmers needs to follow for effective pest 
management.
3.	 Farmers need to understand the Economic 
Threshold level  of major pest of the crops 
grown. 
4.	 Biological control methods results in sus-
tainable pest control. 
5.	 Farmers are advised to harvest the fruits 
and vegetables after the waiting period to 
minimize the residual effect.
6.	 Seed treatment prevents soil and seed 
borne infestation of insects and diseases
7.	 Select varieties and hybrids resistant to 
most common and economically impor-
tant diseases. 
8.	 One year seeding, seven years weeding. 
Hence,  prevent spreading of seeds of 
weeds.

4. Farm Management
What is a farm?
F
arm is a socio economic unit. It is composed of 
farm family, farm enterprises and structures. 
Farmer is a grower cum manager. The farmer has 
to decide how much land, labour, capital and type 
of technology to use to produce in a given season. 
Ultimately, the farmer has to earn a profit to sup-
port his livelihood.
What will the farmer do in farm man-
agement?
The farmer would efficiently use the available re-
sources to increase profits through deciding among 
the best alternatives available.
Some basic functions of farm manage-
ment 
The farmer performs following basic functions to 
effectively manage the farm:
Diagnosis: Analysis of past performance of farm, 
its weakness/strengths.
Planning: Planning for the future crops/animals 
considering the opportunities and threats.
Implementation: Efficient implementation with 
least cost.
Monitoring: Reduce the losses and increase the 
profits by reducing the costs and choosing better 
technologies based on the observed opportunities.
Evaluation: Evaluating the actions for repeating 
the succeses in future.
What will happen if the farmer does 
not do farm management?
In the absence of good farm management, the 
farmer may experience losses in farming for the fol-
lowing the reasons:
• 
There is continuous changes in supply and price 
of agri inputs like seeds, fertilizers, irrigation, 
power etc. 
• 
There is continuous change in prices of the pro-
duce (outputs) in the market due to demand 
and supply changes.
• 
There is continuous change in the farm tech-
nologies.
Module 1: Is farming a business?

100
Farm Management
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
Therefore the objectives of farming as a 
business are: 
• 
How to choose best variety/crop/cropping pat-
tern
• 
How to minimise input cost by judicious use 
• 
How to increase the production and productiv-
ity
• 
How to enhance the quality
• 
How to plan market driven production
• 
Choosing the better source of finance and bet-
ter avenues for investment
• 
Efficient risk management
For better farm management, the farm-
er should have thorough knowledge of 
the following aspects: 
• 
Farm map
• 
Soil slope and topography
• 
Soil type (physical and chemical properties)
• 
Soil colour such as red soil or black soil
• 
Weather parameter such as rainfall, tempera-
ture, relative humidity, etc.
• 
Vegetative cover such as trees, weeds, etc.
• 
Irrigation potential from borewell/tubewell/
nala/channels
• 
Drainage facilities - whether water gets logged 
or not
• 
Technology available and whether the farmer 
can access  them easily
• 
Risk factors like hand loans and high rate of in-
terest
• 
Market facilities - whether they are near to his 
farm or far off
• 
Communication facilities like cell phone and 
internet connectivity
• 
Physical and infrastructure facilities such as 
godowns, roads for transport, vehicles, custom 
hiring centers, etc.
• 
Whether a farmer can afford the crop/animal 
he/she wishes to grow or rear considering the 
above conditions
• 
Supporting programmes and schemes/subsi-
dies
Farmers should maintain farm records 
to have a holistic knowledge of their 
production system 
For example: If a farmer maintains a record for all 
the cost of production such as inputs, labour, etc. 
for the entire crop cycle along with yield and in-
come obtained from selling the produce, he/she 
can compare with the next crop cycle to understand 
whether his/her profit increased or decreased. The 
records also provides information on activities 
which contributed for his/her profit or loss so that, 
the farmer can take alternative decisions to enhance 
his/her net income.
Farm Resources: To make good farm manage-
ment decisions, farmers need some basic knowl-
edge on farm resources such as the extent of land 
available for cultivation, source of irrigation, family 
labour, availability of labour, skill level of labours, 
livestock, availability of fodder, availability of farm 
machinery, availability of inputs such as seeds 
and fertilizers, credit requirement and availability, 
source of credit, market demand for produce, in-
frastructure such as cold storage and godowns. etc. 
For example, regarding manpower and livestock the 
farmers have to understand following issue:
Man Power
• 
Skill: Is the labour employed is skilled, e.g. cot-
ton picking skill?
• 
Knowledge: Does the farmer/labour have a 
thorough knowledge of the package of practices 
of the crop? 
• 
Attitude: Does he/she have a positive attitude 
towards the technology? 
Live Stock
• 
Breed: Selection of a suitable breed 
• 
Production capacity: For instance, milk produc-
tion, meat production and egg laying capacity.
• 
Adaptability: Does the selected breed adapt to 
the local situation? 
• 
Drafting capacity: Knowledge on the draught 
capacity of animal.
• 
Resistance: Is the foreign breeds resistant to lo-
cal Indian conditions. E.g. the Holstein Fresian 
is highly sensitive to high temperatures.
• 
Feeding habit: Are the upgrade breeds or im-
ported breeds capable of feeding on locally 
available feed materials

What does one need to know about the market if one wants to do good business? 
The market for agricultural produce
The market for inputs and equipment
The location of the market
The locations of sale
Who is the buyer?
Who sells the inputs and equipments?
The quality of product that is demanded by the 
market
The quality of inputs and equipment
The price of the product compared to other mar-
kets
The price of sale of the inputs and equipments
When to sell
When to buy
How does the price of agricultural products change?
The price of agriculture products change according 
to the season of the year
The price of agriculture products change between 
years
At times of abundance, the prices are lowest
The price of a product that is needed by more and 
more people will rise from one year to the next
At times of scarcity, the prices are highest
The price a product that is produced in greater 
abundance will fall from one year to the next
The quality of inputs and equipment
The price of sale of the inputs and equipments
When to buy
Important Lesson
T
o DO successful farm business, the farmer must be well aware of prices (of inputs and produce) at dif-
ferent markets. This allows the farmer to plan production as well as make decisions on the purchase of 
inputs and the sale of produce.
Module 2: Know your farm resources
FARM PLANNING: Farm planning is to help 
the farmers to move to a higher level of production 
and income, starting from where he/she is now with 
the resource available to him/her. In this process, 
the farmer has to consider different types of enter-
prises like: 
• 
Land based (agril. production activities, pisci-
culture, plantation, seed production, etc.)
• 
Animal component based (diary, poultry, goat-
ery, piggery, duckery, etc.)
• 
Nursery/orchard
• 
Non-land based (mushroom, apiculture, ver-
miculture, etc.)
In the present example, three crops namely paddy, 
cotton and maize have been taken into comparison 
Module 3: Manage your farm for enough income to 
sustain yourself

grow the following combinations in a year: 
• 
Paddy – Paddy (Kharif followed by Rabi)
• 
Paddy – Maize (Kharif followed by Rabi)
• 
Cotton – Maize (Kharif followed by Rabi)

* It proves that Paddy after Paddy realises the highest profit throughout the year followed by Cotton – 
Maize. Paddy – Cotton is not feasible.
Remember: Even if Paddy after Paddy promises the highest profit throughout the year, farmer should 
avoid continuous monocropping to ensure soil fertility through crop diversification and rotation to 
realize sustained profitability of their farm.
Main Lessons
• 
To know if you are doing successful business with a crop, you need to know the “Income” and 
“Expenditure” accurately.
• 
The farmer records the inputs & labour used in a field, and calculates the “Income” and “Ex-
penditure”
• 
From the “Income” the farmer subtracts the Expenditure. The result indicates whether farm is 
making profit or loss. 
• 
The farmer makes a profit or good business if the “Income” is greater than the “Ex-
penditure.” 
• 
It is a loss, if the “Expenditure” is greater than the “Income.” In that case it is bad business. 
• 
A loss is illustrated by the the minus (dash) and a profit by the plus in front of the number.
• 
A good farmer will abandon loss making crop or use a better technique to make a profit. 
• 
To ensure a profit, the farmer needs to visualise Income and Expenditure before production. 
• 
The Difference between Income and Expenditure indicates whether we are making a loss or 
profit from the use of the land. 
• 
The Unit Cost of a crop indicates if it can compete with the same crop produced elsewhere. 
In the case of food crops, the Unit Cost indicates if it is preferable to buy the produce in the 
market. 
• 
The good farmer calculates well ahead of the season to decide what to produce and which 
techniques to use. 
• 
During the production season the good farmer keeps records on money spent for farm opera-
tions and inputs. 
• 
After the harvest, the good farmer evaluates the profit and identifies what changes are needed 
to improve the planning and profit for the next production season

What are Fixed Costs?
C
ertain costs are called fixed costs.  These are costs for equipment and tools that the farmer owns and 
are used for various crops over several years, such as sprayers, irrigation pumps, buildings etc.  The 
Fixed Costs do not vary with the size of the field.

Module 5: Manage your Money throughout the Year
Bad management of money 
• 
How does one know if the money is managed badly? 
• 
What are the causes? 
• 
What must one do to manage money well during the year? 
One must plan! The person, who fails to plan, plans to fail! 
First Step: Please look at Income and Expenditure for different crops on the farm and also look at 
household expenditures. Below are the expenditures of a Household of 5 persons (1 child not yet in 
school, 1 child in primary school, 1 old parent along with husband and wife).  We discuss if we can pre-
dict all these expenditures.

Let us put these numbers into a financial calendar. On the next page you will see the numbers calcu-
lated in Module 5. 
• 
How much money is left at the end of each month? 
• 
How much money is left at the end of the year?

Case 1: Paddy – Paddy financial calendar based on a farm using current practices (Rs) – Exercise

Farm Management
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
* As the income is realised only during May and November, the monthly balance is shown as negative 
which indicates that the farmers raises a hand loan/personal loan or shall keep the gross income (Rs 81,400 
X 2 = 162,800) and spend through out the year based on the need. 
Note: In this example all produce from the farm is sold as per the prevailing market rates. The profit of the 
farmer depends on the price for the produce i.e., whether the Minimum Support Price (MSP) or market 
rates are prevailing - which are both fluctuating.  
Third Step: 
Fill the second financial calendar. The expenditures for inputs and labour are those from the exercise 
Sheets in Module 5 – using improved practices. 
Fourth Step: 
Discuss the differences and which situation is preferable. What changes are necessary? 
Main Lessons
• 
In the agricultural enterprise, expenditure for the farm and the household are incurred every 
month. But the revenue comes only after sale of produce. Therefore there are months of the 
year where the expenditures are greater than the revenues. These months are called “deficit 
months.”
• 
For this reason, the good farmer makes a financial calendar. The farmer plans expenditures for 
production and household needs in consultation with his spouse.
• 
To be able to cover the expenditures in deficit months, the good farmer saves money from the 
sales of produce (“surplus months”). 
• 
Improved techniques may contribute to improve the revenues of the farmer. 
• 
The needs for inputs can be identified with calculations of gross margin and the financial cal-
endar. This information can be used to make savings in a targeted way or to solicit credit for 
production. 
• 
The above calculations are done for a farmer with one hectare for Paddy – Paddy combination 
in Kharif and Rabi for one year. The same exercise should be repeated for taking farm manage-
ment decisions for the combinations such as
• 
Cotton – Maize (Kharif – Rabi)
• 
Paddy – Maize (Kharif – Rabi)
• 
Maize – Maize (Kharif – Rabi)
Risk in Agriculture
T
he farmer does not like risks because they are difficult to predict. However, he/she can determine the 
risk during the planning so that the impact on revenues could be minimised. For example, Module 4 
indicates income and expenditure of paddy, maize and cotton. With available data, Paddy - Paddy is the 
best preferred cropping pattern. However, the farmer can make a judicious decision taking prevailing and 
anticipated risks into considerations. The anticipated risks and possible decisions are as follows:
Anticipated Risks
Remarks
Reduction in Paddy Market price by 10% 
Cotton – Maize is preferred
Inadequate water due to drought for Paddy - Paddy Cotton – Maize is preferred followed by Maize 
- Maize. Quantity of water available decides the 
cropping pattern.

Main Lessons
• 
Comparing the gross margins of different crops and the production techniques, helps to make 
decisions on using the land to maximise revenue. This comparison is important to all agricul-
tural entrepreneurs.
• 
Comparing the labour productivity helps to identify the crops and techniques that make best 
use of labour (family or wage labour). It also indicates if it is profitable to work on your own 
farm.
• 
Comparing the capital productivity indicates which crops or production techniques make 
best use of money invested.
• 
Production decisions are based on these comparisons. 
• 
The good agricultural entrepreneur knows that a fluctuation in prices constitutes a risk and 
revenues. Risks are concern for traditional as well as improved varieties and techniques.
• 
To evaluate the impact of this market risk, the entrepreneur calculates estimated the gross 
margin with a much lower price (pessimistic) than the current price (or last season’s price). If 
the pessimistic gross margin estimate can still satisfy the revenue objectives, then the risk is 
acceptable.
• 
To evaluate the impact of production risks, the agricultural entrepreneurs calculates a gross 
margin using a yield lower (pessimistic) than expected. If the pessimistic gross margin esti-
mate can still satisfy the revenue objectives, then the risk is acceptable.

n agriculture, farmers work under open condition in natural environment, which expose them to vari-
ous occupational hazards, especially more caused due to handling of chemicals and machineries. Be-
sides, natural hazards are caused due to snakebite, wild animal attack, etc. Knowledge on preventive and 
curative aspects of these occupational hazards would reduce risks and ensure the safety to the farmers.

Gases, pathogen
• 
Skin diseases such as fungal infections 
and allergic reactions
• 
Parasitic diseases such as malaria, 
sleeping sickness and hookworm
• 
Animal related diseases such as an-
thrax, bovine tuberculosis and rabies 
(at least 40 of the 250 animal related 
diseases are occupational diseases in 
agriculture)
• 
Cancers
• 
Workers are in direct contact with en-
vironmental pathogens, fungi, infect-
ed animals, and allergenic plants
• 
Workers have intimate contact with 
parasites in soil, waste water/sewage, 
dirty tools and unhygienic housing
• 
Workers have ongoing, close contact 
with animals through raising and 
sheltering
• 
Agricultural workers are exposed to 
a mix of biological agents, pesticides, 
and diesel fumes, all linked with can-
cer
Others
• 
Electricity shocks, fire, road accidents, 
livestock and wild animal attacks, fall-

Loss of life and injuries and suffering 
to the dependents
Adapted from IFPRI, 2006
5.5. Factors that may increase risk of 
injury or illness for farm workers
Age: Injury rates are highest under 15 and over 65 
years of age.
Equipment and machinery: Most farm acci-
dents and fatalities involve machinery. Proper ma-
chine guarding and regular equipment maintenance 
according to manufacturers’ recommendations can 
help prevent accidents.
Non-availability of protective equipments: 
Using protective equipment, such as seat belts on 
tractors and personal protective equipment (such as 
safety gloves, cover alls, boots, hats, aprons, goggles 
and face shields) could significantly reduce farming 
injuries.
Lack of medical care: Hospitals and emergency 
medical care are typically not readily accessible in 
rural areas near farms. However, the farmers may 
utilize for example 108 mobile medical emergency 
services during emergencies. 
Socio - economic risks
• 
There are dangers due to indiscriminate pes-
ticide/weedicide application to soil, water, air, 
food chain, natural enemies of pest, resistance 
of pest, etc.
• 
Pesticides are hazardous, so there will be asso-
ciated risk and impact of risk on social system 
including economic damage. So there should 
be a proper understanding on hazards of pes-
ticides.
Effects on human beings
• 
Pesticides accumulate in fatty tissues and re-
productive cells lead to birth defects, abnor-
malities, abortions, premature deliveries, etc.
• 
Farm workers who regularly spray pesticides 
are susceptible to impaired eyesight.
• 
The liver is particularly susceptible to damage 
by chlorinated hydrocarbons, which can lead to 
higher risk of serious infection.
Environmental exposures lead to
• 
Air pollution
• 
Soil and water pollution
• 
Food contamination
Looking into the implications of pesticides on so-
cio-economic dimensions, use of pesticides should 
be judiciously planned only in critical situations 
with utmost care. Management of pest below Eco-
nomic Threshold Level (ETL) is most desirable.
5.6. Safe handling of agro chemicals
A
gro chemicals are widely used in agriculture, 
which are major source of health hazards to 
farmers. Important tips to farmers for safe use of 
agro chemicals are as follows:

Occupational Health and Safety
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
123
Buying pesticides

nity water sources.
Colour Coding of pesticides: 
The colour band on the pesticide container indi-
cates the hazard level of pesticides. While han-
dling pesticides farmers should take colour band 
into consideration.
• 
Red – Very toxic to toxic
• 
Yellow – Harmful
• 
Blue - Moderately hazardous
• 
Green - Acute hazard unlikely in normal use
5.7. First aid measures for pesticide 
poisoning
• 
In case of skin contact, remove contaminant 
contacts and wash with clean water.
• 
In case of inhalation, remove from site and 
provide good clean air site, keep the head and 
shoulder upright.
• 
In case of unconscious and breathing stops, 
provide artificial respiration.
• 
If pesticide is swallowed, induce vomiting by 
giving 2-3 liters salt water. Give milk after that.

124
Occupational Health and Safety
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
• 
Take the patient to doctor at the earliest.
• 
Take the container along with patient to consult 
doctor.
Snake and other animal bites or attacks 
and precautions
Snakebite is a routinely occurring life threatening 
emergency in India. The mortality and morbidity 
associated with the diverse presentation of snake-
bites can be decreased if a proper history of the 
patient’s background and habits combined with a 
thorough knowledge of the specific features of the 
regional snakes are kept in mind.
Physical and mental drudgery
To reduce drudgery related to hard work in differ-
ent agricultural operations, several technologies for 
land preparation, weeding, pesticide application 
and various other farm works have been developed 
including farm machinery which need to be used 
by the farmers to keep themselves fit and healthy. 
Farmers are advised to contact local extension 
functionaries and scientists to obtain information 
on such drudgery reducing farm machineries.
5.8. Care in use of pesticides by 
farmers 
Useful tips for safe use of pesticides by farm-
ers are:
• 
Identify the pest and ascertain the damage done.
• 
Use pesticide only if it has exceeded the economical injury level. 
• 
Use only the recommended pesticide, which is the least toxic.
• 
Read instructions manual of the pesticide and equipment.
• 
Check the spraying equipment and accessories, which are to be used.
• 
Ascertain that all components are clean, especially filling and suction, 
strainer, sprayer tank, cut off device and nozzle
• 
Replace worn out parts such as ‘O’ ring, seal, gasket, worn out nozzle tip, 
hose clamps and valves. 
• 
Test the sprayer and ascertain whether it pumps the required output at 
rated pressure. Check the nozzle spray pattern and discharge rate.
• 
Calibrate the sprayer. Set sprayer speed and nozzle swath by adjusting 
spray height and nozzle spacing.

5.10. Safety tips to reduce the risk of 
injuries and fatalities while handling 
machineries
C
ontrary to the popular image of fresh air and 
peaceful surroundings, a farm is not a hazard 
free work setting. Every year, thousands of farm 
workers are injured and hundreds die in farming 
accidents. Safety in agriculture is one of the main 
concern, especially  when handling with farm tools 
and machinery. Many accidents in agriculture go 
unnoticed because they will not be reported. So 
learning from mistakes will be less. Safety tips to 
reduce the risk of injuries and fatalities while han-
dling machineries are as follows:
• 
Safety can be improved on farm by increasing 
awareness of farming hazards and making a 
conscious effort to prepare for emergency situ-
ations including fires, vehicle accidents, elec-
trical shocks from equipment and wires and 
chemical exposures. 
• 
Be especially alert to hazards that may affect 
children and the elderly. 
• 
Minimize hazards by carefully selecting the 
products to ensure safety.
• 
Always use seat belts when operating tractors.
• 
Read and follow instructions in equipment op-
erator’s manuals and on product labels.
• 
Inspect equipment routinely for problems that 
may cause accidents.
• 
Discuss safety hazards and emergency proce-
dures with all concerned.
• 
Take precautions to prevent entrapment and 
suffocation caused by unstable surfaces of 
grain storage bins and silos. Never “walk on the 
grain.” 
• 
Be aware that methane gas, carbon dioxide, 
ammonia and hydrogen sulfide can form in un-
ventilated grain silos and manure pits and can 
suffocate or poison farmers or explode.
• 
Wear clothing that fits well and is not loose fit-
ting to avoid being caught in pinch points. 

128
Occupational Health and Safety
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
• 
Never reach over or work near unguarded ro-
tating parts.
• 
Turn off machinery to attend to repairs.
• 
	
Always replace shields that were removed 
for maintenance.
• 
Plug unused or failed borewell pits
• 
Check all equipment for potential w.rap points 
(e.g. where clothing or hair could be wrapped 
around a shaft) and if possible, shield those 
points.
• 
Replace any damaged manufacturer installed 
warning labels and place warnings on equip-
ment parts not previously labeled (consider 
painting them with a bright color, perhaps with 
a wide stripe).
• 
Stay alert and warn others when working with 
shear and cutting points (e.g. objects with 
blades or hard edges used to cut). Some shear 
and cutting points cannot be guarded, which 
can result in severe cuts, lost limbs or injuries 
from objects thrown by the cutting type equip-
ment.
• 
Wait until a tractor has stopped completely be-
fore stepping into the hitching position. 
• 
Never touch free-wheeling parts (i.e. parts that 
continue to spin after the power is shut off) un-
til they have stopped moving. This could take 
2-2½ minutes.
• 
Be aware of burn points: mufflers, manifolds 
and even gear cases.
• 
Hydraulic systems contain fluid under extreme 
pressure. Before loosening, tightening, remov-
ing or otherwise working with any fittings or 
parts, relieve this pressure (shut off the hy-
draulic pump, lower implements and follow 
instructions in the operator’s manual). 
• 
Keep equipment in good repair and safety fea-
tures up to date.
• 
“Proper machine inspection and maintenance 
can help prevent accidents”. 
• 
When it comes to machinery maintenance, 
a shield and guard to cover spinning parts or 
blades should be kept in place. 
• 
Follow the one seat, one rider rule. If there is 
only one seat on the equipment, there should 
only be one rider – an adult.
• 
Don’t allow children to play or ride on equip-
ment or in areas where machinery is used or 
stored.
• 
Under aged children should not operate 2, 3, 
and 4 wheeled vehicles.
• 
Do not allow riders or passengers in the back 
of pickup trucks.
• 
Before starting machinery, all operators should 
know where kids are located. You may be un-
able to hear or see children, especially behind 
large wheels or in blind spots.
• 
All equipment should be parked and locked 
with the keys removed when not in use.
• 
Keep hand tools out of reach of children, espe-
cially those with sharp or hot parts.
Better safety and health practices reduce farmer fa-
talities, injuries and illnesses as well as associated 
costs such as workers’ compensation insurance 
premiums, lost production and medical expenses. 
A safer and more healthy workplace improves mo-
rale and productivity.
First aid for accidents: The farmers injured 
should be given first aid at the earliest in order to 
reduce the damage caused by the injuries. Impor-
tant tips are as follows:
• 
The treatment should be given from a person 
trained in basic first aid, using supplies from a 
first-aid kit.
• 
Medical treatment and care given at the site of 
any medical emergency or while transporting 
any victim to a medical facility.
• 
Make sure that first-aid trained personnel are 
available to provide quick and effective first-
aid. Alternatively, one of the family members 
should be trained.
• 
Make sure first-aid supplies at your workplace 
are appropriate to your occupational setting. 
The response time of your emergency medical 
services is very important.
• 
Good knowledge about locally available anti-
dotes or medicinal plants, which can be used.
• 
Keep the first aid kit(s) in the work place.
• 
Keep clean water in the work place.
• 
Keep mobile numbers of trained person on 
first aid, ambulances, local hospital, local doc-
tors and vehicle owners in the near by vicinity.
5.11. Suggested items for your first-
aid kit

the farmers to bring about changes starting 
from selection of crops till the marketing.
Past experience: The most important source of in-
formation to the farmers is his/her past experience 
itself. However before acting upon information 
based on past experience, he/she needs to cross 
check the relevance to the present context. 
Progressive farmers: are the small segment of rural 
life who are socially, economically and technologi-
cally advanced compared to other farmers. They 
go in search of advanced technologies proactively, 
adopt and harvest the benefit of technologies. They 
are the nearest and easiest source of agricultural in-
formation to other farmers. For example, contact 
farmers, award winning farmers, Block Farmers 
Advisory Committee (BFAC) members, District 
Farmers Advisory Committee (DFAC) members, 
State Farmers Advisory Committee (SFAC) mem-
bers, farmers running farm school, etc.
Input Dealers: are mostly village level businessmen 
who sell seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and machiner-
ies to the farmers. Also provides extension adviso-
ries by their strength of proximity to the farmers. 
However maximum precautions has to be exercised 
for accessing the advisory services as they are not 
professionally qualified extension functionaries. 
However, some input dealers are trained through 
various programme like Diploma in Agricultural 
Extension Service for Input Dealers (DAESI) who 
can provide quality agricultural information. In 
other cases, advisory from local public extension 
functionaries and inputs based on the advisory 
from input dealers can be accessed.

Improving agricultural policies to enhance 
food security in Tunisia: 
A retrospective and prospective analysis
Chokri Thabet*, Zouhair Rached**, Ali Chebil***
DOI: 10.30682/nm2403g 
JEL codes: E64, Q16, Q18
Abstract
This paper explores the evolution and future perspectives of agricultural policies in Tunisia, focusing on 
their role in enhancing food security. The agricultural sector, while contributing around 9% to GDP and 
employing 16% of the active population, faces numerous challenges including water scarcity, climate 
change, and economic pressures from international trade. The study identifies that despite economic di-
versification, agriculture remains crucial for rural livelihoods and food security. Also, the paper critiques 
existing policies, particularly the inefficiencies in subsidies and the complexity of administrative proce-
dures, which disadvantage small farmers. The analysis underscores the need for policy reforms aimed at 
improving farmers’ incomes, reducing policy costs, and enhancing efficiency. Recommendations include 
developing infrastructure, promoting modern agricultural technologies, and adjusting trade policies to 
better balance export promotion with import substitution. The study concludes that a dynamic and trans-
parent agricultural policy, responsive to international changes and inclusive of all farmer categories, is 
essential for sustainable agricultural development and food security in Tunisia.
Keywords: Agricultural policy, Food security, Retrospective and prospective analysis, Tunisia.
1.  Introduction
The agricultural sector in Tunisia plays a vital 
role in the country’s economy, despite its rela-
tively small contribution to GDP compared to 
other sectors. Indeed, agriculture contributed 
around 9% to GDP during the period 2019-2023, 
with an additional 3.2% coming from the agri-
food industry (AFI). However, the share of the 
agri-food sector in the GDP has decreased from 
about 16 to 9 percent in between 1996 and 2023 
(ONAGRI). Despite the diversification observed 
in the Tunisian economy, the agricultural sector 
remains economically and socially important for 
its contribution to the achievement of national 
objectives as regards to food security and em-
ployment. Agriculture represents 10% of total 
investments and employs 16% of active popula-
tion, with half working in the cereals sub-sector 
(ITES, 2017).
The agricultural sector is made up of three 
main sub-sectors: crop production, animal pro-
duction, and fisheries/aquaculture production. 

NEW MEDIT N. 3/2024
92
Crop production represents 64% of total output, 
while the rest is split between animal and fish-
eries production at an average of 28% and 8% 
respectively. Domestic production is estimated 
to fulfill nearly 50% of the nation’s cereal needs, 
all livestock product needs, and more than 80% 
of its oil needs (ONAGRI, 2020). 
According to FAOSTAT, Tunisia has about 10 
million hectares of agricultural land, with around 
4 million hectares utilized, 90% of which is 
rain-fed. Irrigated agriculture, the biggest water 
consumer, uses 82% of the available resources 
(World Bank, 2020). Primary crops by area in-
clude olives (49%), wheat (17%), barley (13%), 
almonds (5%), and dates (2%), and by production 
quantity: tomatoes (15%), wheat (14%), olives 
(12%), barley (6%), watermelon (6%), potatoes 
(5%), and chilies& pepper (5%). 
In terms of foreign trade, the food balance made 
up 12% of Tunisia’s overall trade balance between 
2019 and 2023. Agricultural and agri-food prod-
ucts constitute 9.6% of total imports and 10.8% of 
total exports. Key imports include durum wheat, 
bread wheat, maize, and soya cake, with wheat 
alone accounting for over 51% of food imports. 
On the export side, major agri-food products in-
clude olive oil, fishery products, dates, and citrus. 
The food balance coverage rate was around 75% 
between 2010 and 2023 (ONAGRI, 2023). 
However, Tunisia’s agricultural sector faces 
challenges such as water scarcity (357 m3/capita/
year), climate change, soil degradation. Indeed, 
the majority of farms are small. Around 75% of 
farmers manage less than 5 hectares (ONAGRI, 
2020). This can make modernization and mech-
anization of farming difficult. The lack of stor-
age and transport infrastructure can also cause 
problems for product marketing. The Tunisian 
agricultural sector has also faced significant 
exogenous shocks, challenging its openness to 
external markets and highlighting the impor-
tance of food security. Notably, these include the 
COVID-19 health crisis and the war in Ukraine.
This paper provides a retrospective analysis of 
the Tunisian agri-food policies. It also identifies 
the new challenges and future perspectives of 
these policies for improving the agricultural sec-
tor’s performance and promoting food security 
in Tunisia.
2.  Main features of the Tunisian agriculture 
sector
2.1.  Importance of agricultural sector
Agricultural sector in Tunisia is a fundamental 
source of economic growth. Despite the change 
and diversification observed in the Tunisian 
economy (industrialization, growth of service 
sector and expansion of tourism), the agricultur-
al sector remains important for its contribution to 
food security, economic and social development. 
The importance of agriculture to the country’s 
economy is highlighted also by its contribution 
to supporting rural livelihoods and controlling 
urban migration as it employs about a quarter of 
the Tunisian workforce (Touayi, 2004). 
Over recent decades, most indicators show 
that the relative importance of Tunisian agri-
cultural sector in the overall economy has been 
declining. The share of agriculture in Tunisia’s 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been sig-
nificant changes over the decades, reflecting the 
country’s economic transformations. Historical-
ly, agriculture was a major pillar of the Tunisian 
economy. However, with the development of the 
industrial and service sectors, the relative share 
of agriculture in GDP has declined. From the 
1960s to 1970s, agriculture made up over 20% 
of Tunisia’s GDP, with the economy being large-
ly agricultural and the population predominantly 
rural. Since the 1980s, the share of agriculture in 
GDP began to decline due to economic diversi-
fication and the growth of industrial and service 
sectors, yet it still contributed around 15-20%. 
In the 1990s and 2000s, this share further de-
creased to about 12-15%, then to around 10-
12%, as economic reforms and the rise of tour-
ism and ICT became more prominent. By the 
2010s, the agricultural share stabilized at 8-10%, 
continuing to be important for rural employment 
and food security. Between 2017 and 2022, ag-
riculture accounted for approximately 10% of 
GDP, remaining vital for rural communities and 
significant for exports like olive oil, dates, citrus, 
and seafood (Boudiche et al., 2022). This evo-
lution, economic diversification and the growth 
of industrial and service sectors reduced reliance 
on agriculture.

NEW MEDIT N. 3/2024
93
The major challenge facing the agricultural 
sector, in addition to climate change and limit-
ed production resources, is the competition from 
imported products, which can reduce the price 
of local produce. Traditional farming practices 
and the use of chemical fertilizers can also exac-
erbate the degradation of soil and water quality.
2.2.  Main agricultural commodities
Agriculture in Tunisia is characterized by 
a wide diversity of crops, including cereals 
(wheat, barley), fruits and vegetables (olives, 
dates, citrus), dairy products, and meat. The 
country’s land, spanning approximately 16 mil-
lion hectares, is classified into three primary 
types: one-third arable land, one-third forests 
and rangeland, and the remaining third as desert. 
The arable land, of about 5 million hectares, is 
typically allocated to three main activities: one 
third to cereals, one third to olive trees and the 
rest to everything else. The irrigable areas in this 
country has increased from 200 thousands ha to 
420 thousands ha in 2020. The heads (numbers) 
is declining over last decade due to low produc-
tivity and profitability.
The major crops grown in Tunisia are cereals, 
food legumes, forages and trees crops. This later 
covers 2 million ha, with the dominating activ-
ity being olive production (3/4). Regarding the 
livestock activities, the heads (numbers) is de-
clining over last decade due to low productivity 
and profitability.
Tunisian farm structures are dominated by 
small farmers. Fam sizes of less 5 hectares 
are increasing in numbers while large ones are 
declining. This is indication of the increasing 
agricultural land fragmentation process that is 
taking place in the country, which represents 
a major constraint to the agricultural develop-
ment in the country.

2.3.  Agricultural products trade 
The most exported agricultural products in Tu-
nisia are olive oil, dates, citrus and fish. In fact, 
olive oil, dates and fish exports represent to-
gether about 50 percent of the value of Tunisian 
agricultural exports (Table 2). A major share of 
all exports of agricultural commodities goes to 
traditional markets of the UE. Tunisians pattern 
of exports is dominated by olive oil. The other 
large products of exports are the fishery products 
and the dates. 
Among the typical products that are imported, 
the cereals are evidently at the top, represented 
about 50% percent in value of its agricultural 
imports.

predominant in the Tunisian agricultural sector, 
with 75% of farmland being under 10 hectares 
in size. Approximately 15% of the workforce is 
engaged in agriculture, along with a significant 
portion in seasonal roles. This sector offers sta-
ble income to about 470.000 farmers, contrib-
uting to rural population stability, with women 
comprising 35% of the agricultural workforce.
3.  Retrospective analysis of past and 
current agricultural policies in Tunisia
Since independence, Tunisia’s economic 
policy has focused on four main objectives: 
I) achieving food self-sufficiency, which has 
evolved into the broader concept of “food se-
curity”; II) promoting agricultural exports such 
as olive oil by subsidizing vegetable oils to pre-
serve more olive oil for export; III) conserv-
ing natural resources (water and soil); and IV) 
enhancing the competitiveness of agricultural 
products in international markets (Laajimi et 
al., 2012; Boudiche et al., 2022).
To achieve these objectives, various econom-
ic instruments have been employed at different 
stages of the agri-food chains. Internal price 
policies, border protection, input use subsidies, 
financial and fiscal incentives and trade policies 
are the main tools used by public authorities to 
support agricultural producers.
3.1.  Price policies
Regarding price policy, public intervention 
distinguishes three regulatory regimes. For the 
first regime (cereals and milk), the state sets a 
guaranteed minimum production price at the be-
ginning of each agricultural season. This aims 
to provide farmers with a signal of future mar-
ket prices to help them make optimal production 
and resource allocation decisions. The set prices 
are those that farmers are assured of receiving 
when they sell their produce. For a long time, 
these prices were higher than world prices, 
but they fell below world prices following the 
2007-2008 food crisis. This downward trend ac-
celerated with the depreciation of the Tunisian 
currency. Between 2012 and 2022, the Tunisian 
dinar depreciated by 34.5% against the Euro and 
38% against the US Dollar. Since 2016, this de-
preciation has had increasingly severe impacts 
on farmers’ incomes and the expenses of the 
compensation fund, widening the gap between 
domestic production prices and global prices for 
several basic agricultural products.
The milk production price administration poli-
cy showed its limits for the first time in 2015 and 
especially in 2016 due to a decline in local de-
mand and dairy product exports, which severely 
affected the capacity of industries to absorb milk 
production despite state subsidies. For the sec-

ond regime (sugar beet and raw tobacco), prices 
are also fixed, but the state intervenes directly 
through a public body that regulates domestic 
prices by releasing the necessary product quan-
tities to absorb any excess demand that would 
drive prices up, thereby aligning the market 
price with the pre-set institutional price. This 
policy requires the government to maintain suf-
ficient stocks. Guaranteeing a minimum produc-
tion price ensures a certain level of remuneration 
for producers and protects them against global 
price fluctuations.
Lastly, for vegetables and meat prices, which 
are supposed to be governed by market mecha-
nisms, public intervention has been heavily criti-
cized for its economic rationality. When national 
production is limited for a given product, prices 
naturally tend to rise. Public authorities inter-
vene whenever these prices reach a level deemed 
too high by setting a ceiling price without com-
pensating producers or even by prohibiting 
exports. Conversely, when prices are very low 
due to abundant national production, no meas-
ures are taken to safeguard producers’ incomes. 
This type of intervention, aimed at controlling 
inflation at the expense of certain categories of 
farmers, has significantly affected their incomes 
and the overall development of the agricultural 
sector in recent years.
The figure illustrates the trend of various food 
production price indices from 2011 to 2023. All 
food production prices show an increasing trend 
over the years, with some categories like Fruits 
and Citrus exhibiting more variability than oth-
ers. This general upward trend indicates growth 
or an increase in these categories’ prices from 
a base index of 100 in 2011 to 2023. Cereals 
prices (represented in blue) start around 100 in 
2011 and show a steady increase, reaching ap-
proximately 167 by 2023. Fruits prices display 
a more variable trend, peaking at about 270 in 
2018, and then reaching their highest point of 
around 313 in 2023.
Index price of fishery exhibits a gradual and 
steady rise over the years, reaching around 
200 by 2023. Index price of olive oil experi-
ences moderate fluctuations, peaking around 
2017 and 2018, and stabilizing at around 200 
by 2023. Legumes price demonstrates a steady 
increase from around 100 in 2011 to approxi-
mately 200 in 2023. Meats also show a consist-
ent upward trend to about 230 in 2023. Citrus 
has the most variability price peaking sharply 
at about 320 in 2018, then fluctuating signifi-
cantly before stabilizing at around 250 in 2023. 
Finally, index of Dates prices shows moderate 
fluctuations but an overall increase from around 
80% between 2011 and 2023.
3.2.  Input use subsidies
In addition to controlling product prices, the 
government intervenes in input prices to sup-
port farmers’ incomes and enhance the inten-

sification of agricultural activities by encour-
aging irrigation and increased use of industrial 
inputs (fertilizers, pesticides, machinery, high-
er-yield varieties, animal feed, etc.). Almost 
all these inputs have been “officially” provid-
ed to farmers at prices below their respective 
market prices. However, in realty, subsidized 
inputs were available in very limited quanti-
ties and often sold through parallel channels 
at much higher prices than those set by the 
government. This systematic intervention, in 
effect during the 1970s and the first part of the 
1980s, aimed to maximize production without 
optimizing input use and without considering 
farmers’ potential reactions to these incentives 
or other related environmental issues. Conse-
quently, progress towards achieving quanti-
tative objectives was modest (Elloumi et al., 
2012). Since the mid-2000s, this policy, in-
stead of controlling production costs in certain 
agricultural activities, has led to accelerated 
transfer of rents to few importers and input 
distributors (Laajimi et al., 2012; La Rovere et 
al., 2010). This situation has worsened since 
2016, with even millers no longer supplying 
animal feed to agricultural cooperatives, de-
spite the entire supply chain being controlled 
and subsidized at every level. These products 
are now sold on the black market at nearly 
double the administered prices.
Regarding irrigation, the government has 
implemented further measures to boost the 
irrigated areas and water efficiency improve-
ment. The State programs involve subsidies of 
modern irrigation equipment (drip) up to 60% 
of total investment costs and irrigation water 
pricing at lower price mainly for cereal crops.
3.3.  Institutional framework
The institutional framework plays a crucial 
role in economic development and has a sig-
nificant impact on agricultural performance. 
The state can influence, either directly or in-
directly, agriculture’s contribution to various 
development goals through series of measures 
and price interventions, facilitated by different 
institutions. For example, the Office of Cere-
als regulates cereal transport and once held a 
near-monopoly on collection and importation. 
However, since 2005, with the liberalization 
of competitive commercial activities, the par-
ticipation of private collectors has steadily in-
creased, rising from 0.7% in 2005 to 42% in 
2010 and 60% in 2023.
The Office of Commerce holds a monopo-
ly on importing sugar and several other food 
products such as potatoes, coffee, and tea. 
The National Oil Office imports edible oils 
and exports olive oil. It is the sole exporter 
under agreements with the EU for bulk olive 
oil, which has a fixed quota of 56,700 tons per 
year. Private actors are allowed to export under 
this quota only when the quantity collected by 
the National Oil Office is below the allocated 
amount. Furthermore, the quota allocation pro-
cess is ambiguous and can lack transparency.
Serious questions arise about the effective-
ness of these offices, which are increasingly 
criticized for their impact on the agricultural 
sector’s development. Issues such as prolonged 
olive oil export crises, grain quality evalua-
tion procedures for price setting, the efficien-
cy of monopoly-controlled agricultural prod-
uct imports, and the rise of black markets for 
various products, particularly livestock feed, 
underscore the need for profound institutional 
reforms. These institutions no longer meet the 
new demands of supporting and developing the 
sector in a highly competitive global environ-
ment that presents both opportunities and risks. 
They appear incapable of playing a pioneering 
role in the sector’s modernization and transfor-
mation. Only through modernization and gen-
uine adaptation of the sector can Tunisia hope 
for a more significant contribution from agri-
culture to the country’s economic and social 
development.
3.4.  Financial and fiscal policies
As for other transfers to producers, they are 
granted with the approval of the Agricultural In-
vestment Promotion Agency (APIA), established 
in 1983. These measures primarily take the form 
of direct investment grants and tax benefits for 
farmers. The new investment code distinguish-
es between two categories of investment grants 

NEW MEDIT N. 3/2024
98
based on the total investment amount: 30% and 
15% for smaller and larger investments, respec-
tively. Additionally, any investment component 
deemed to improve farm competitiveness re-
ceives a 50% grant. This includes, among other 
things, agricultural mechanization and irriga-
tion equipment. However, there is a significant 
gap between goals and reality, as subsidies are 
now almost exclusively directed to large enter-
prises, which are very few in number. Small and 
medium-sized farms are nearly excluded from 
the new subsidy administration system, which 
has become much more complicated in terms 
of procedures and limits subsidy payments to 
the realization of 40% of the planned invest-
ments. This new code and its implementation 
regulations represent the greatest danger to the 
Tunisian agricultural sector, as they fail to con-
sider the characteristics of Tunisian agriculture, 
which is predominantly based on small farms 
that produce almost all of the country’s dairy, 
meat, and vegetable output.
Even the Tunisian tax system, which allows 
for VAT exemption and suspension on certain 
agricultural equipment, remains difficult to 
implement and very costly for both farmers 
and the tax administration itself. Two meas-
ures are effectively in place. The first sus-
pends VAT on two lists of agricultural equip-
ment, specific equipment parts, insecticides, 
and fungicides. The second authorizes spe-
cific exemptions (fuel tax exemption) under 
the investment code. However, over the past 
few years, restrictions on VAT exemption and 
suspension have been gradually introduced. 
To benefit from VAT exemption on inputs and 
equipment, a “local origin” standard is now 
required, covering an extensive list of prod-
ucts. These restrictions are costly for the agri-
cultural sector as they force farmers to source 
from local suppliers, who often provide inferi-
or quality products or sell at relatively higher 
prices. In practice, these measures effectively 
grant local producers a competitive advantage 
equivalent to the VAT rate on a list of prod-
ucts whose selection and annual revision are 
questionable. This VAT regulation is illegal 
considering Tunisia’s commitments under var-
ious trade agreements, which specify that VAT 
should not be used as an equivalent to customs 
duties to discriminate against products based 
on their local or foreign origin. To circumvent 
this, the current regulation states that it is a 
suspension, not an exemption, of VAT.
Viewed from one angle, such a measure 
might seem beneficial for the national econ-
omy. However, considering farmers’ well-be-
ing, the picture changes as they are penalized 
and forced to buy local products, often with 
insignificant local added value, instead of ac-
cessing potentially more competitive and suit-
able imported products. In this context, such 
a policy also diverts the initial fiscal benefits 
intended to encourage agricultural investment 
by creating a captive market for local produc-
ers of inputs and equipment, disregarding the 
farmers’ interests. Besides these system fail-
ures, the procedures required to benefit from 
these advantages are often very complicated 
and costly, preventing small farmers from tak-
ing advantage of them.
3.5.  Trade policy
One of the main objectives assigned to the 
Tunisian economy is to ensure that agricul-
ture contributes to improving the balance of 
payments. To achieve this, export promotion 
policies are implemented for products where 
Tunisia has a comparative advantage (olive oil, 
seafood, dates, citrus fruits). However, given 
the national goal of increasing food self-suf-
ficiency, import substitution policies for food 
products that are socially and economically im-
portant, such as cereals, milk, and beef, are also 
implemented. Consequently, the current issue 
is finding an appropriate mix of export promo-
tion and import substitution policies to improve 
the country’s food security.
The majority of Tunisia’s agricultural and 
agri-food trade is conducted with the European 
Union (EU). Overall, 70% of Tunisian agricul-
tural and agri-food exports are sold on the EU 
market, and 40% of imports of these products 
come from the EU. However, the agricultural 
trade between Tunisia and the EU is currently 
governed by the provisions of the Association 
Agreement which, for these products, provides 

NEW MEDIT N. 3/2024
99
a specific regime based on the exchange of re-
ciprocal concessions (agricultural protocol).
The concessions granted for Tunisian ag-
ricultural exports depend on their nature and 
the sensitivity of the products for the Europe-
an market as well. Four cases are provided: I) 
full exemption from customs duties, without 
restriction on the quantities traded neither on 
the export period; II) a total exemption from 
customs duties, with limitations regarding the 
export period; III) total exemption of customs 
duties for a certain quota, and IV) a partial re-
duction of tariffs, without any quantitative re-
strictions. In contrast, Tunisia has committed to 
provide the EU preferential access to its market 
for cereals, meat and dairy products and also 
consolidate its concessions according to the 
WTO agreements.
Negotiations on agricultural trade between 
Tunisia and the EU in the frame of the CD-
FTA should take into account the recent de-
velopments of the Tunisian economy and en-
compass a more global vision regarding the 
fact that the agricultural sector is supposed to 
play a role within the economic diversification 
strategy in addition to the improvement of so-
cial and economic performance, especially in 
the integration chain of regional and interna-
tional values. 
4.  Emergence of new challenges
Tunisia’s agricultural policy development 
must consider several forward-looking factors 
affecting agricultural production and trade: I) 
Anticipated impacts of climate change: High-
er temperatures and more frequent extreme 
weather events will complicate resource man-
agement, leading to land and groundwater deg-
radation. II) Effects of increased national and 
international demand for higher-quality agri-
cultural and food products: This trend poses 
supply risks for Tunisia but also offers export 
opportunities. III) Fluctuating international 
agricultural prices: Price spikes may encour-
age greater production, yet market volatility 
raises investment risks. IV) Expected rises in 
energy and agricultural input costs, influencing 
production and marketing expenses. V) Global 
conflicts and geostrategic issues (e.g., Ukraini-
an-Russian conflict, Palestine) that can disrupt 
food availability. VI) Challenges like pandem-
ics, diseases, and crop pests exacerbated by cli-
mate change.
Actually, the agricultural sector faces a mul-
titude of challenges and issues. At the agricul-
tural investment level, the dominant approach 
to agricultural investment tends to favor large 
enterprises while largely neglecting small and 
medium-sized farms. Additionally, ineffective 
input subsidies and cumbersome administration 
contribute to the complexity of the situation. 
the reluctance of financial institutions, notably 
the national bank responsible for financing the 
agricultural sector, given the absence of land 
titles for the majority of agricultural operations 
and the status of farmers.
Moreover, in terms of marketing, an oligop-
oly exerts control over milk prices, and grain 
prices often fall below global standards. Sim-
ilarly, the lack of transparency in the market-
ing system poses a significant obstacle to the 
sector’s profitability. The presence of unfavora-
ble logistics, coupled with a money laundering 
sector that increases agricultural production 
costs, exacerbates the difficulties faced by the 
sector. Agricultural incomes are declining, and 
the capacity for processing and adding value 
to agricultural products is low. Markets for 
agricultural equipment and inputs suffer from 
imperfect competition. The sector lacks a clear 
agricultural policy, faces continuously rising 
production costs, and has no credible commer-
cial policy. Controlling the loss and wastage of 
agricultural along the entire value chain covers 
a large part of food deficits (FAO, 2022; Ben 
Becher, 2016). 
The existence of significant regional im-
balances has led to considerable exodus and 
migration of rural populations, with approxi-
mately one million people leaving rural are-
as over a six-year period. The inefficiency of 
natural resource management and governance 
policies for water and soil conservation, cou-
pled with agricultural research disconnected 
from real development issues, exacerbates the 
situation, consequently threatening the sec-
tor’s sustainability.

NEW MEDIT N. 3/2024

5.  Prospective analysis of agricultural 
policies in Tunisia
The entire current policy for encouraging 
the agricultural sector has become unclear and 
should be reformed to ensure better efficiency in 
both spending and expected outcomes. This pol-
icy became obsolete when Tunisia started sub-
sidizing imported products at the expense of lo-
cally produced ones, effectively imposing a new 
tax on the sector, leading to a continuous decline 
in agricultural incomes. This phenomenon began 
in 2008 but significantly increased in 2016 and 
especially during 2017-2019. This observation 
is particularly relevant to bovine milk, for which 
production and consumption prices are set by 
the government. Despite significant rises in pro-
duction costs due to increased prices of concen-
trated feeds—most of which are imported—the 
government has repeatedly refused to raise the 
price paid to local producers. To address the 
milk supply shortage, the government imports 
milk at prices significantly higher than those re-
ceived by local producers. In other words, the 
government opts to import milk at higher prices 
rather than raising consumer prices, hoping for a 
future decrease in global feed prices.
The reality is that the country lacks an effec-
tive agricultural policy, which should ideally 
achieve three main objectives: increase and di-
versify production, ensure sufficient profitability 
for producers, and preserve the country’s main 
natural resources, especially water and land. 
Currently, these objectives are far from being 
achieved, and the sector is confronted with con-
tradictory instruments resulting in decreased 
agricultural incomes, reduced productivity, and 
capacity to adjust, and above all, depletion of 
natural resources. Meanwhile, significant pub-
lic expenditures continue to be allocated to the 
agricultural sector, albeit with very low efficien-
cy. In Tunisia, the state budget allocated to the 
Ministry of Agriculture and its public enterpris-
es reaches between 10 and 15% of agricultural 
value added, a substantial amount compared to 
other countries. Thus, the issue is not to increase 
spending but rather to better manage current re-
sources for improved economic and social effi-
ciency of the sector.
Even with the most favorable conditions for 
the development of the Tunisian agricultural 
sector, economic benefits remain limited due to 
the low capacity for reallocation and adjustment 
within Tunisian agriculture. It seems to possess 
a comparative advantage in arboriculture and its 
derivatives (specifically olives), but its produc-
tion capacities are constrained by the very nature 
of this type of cultivation (which has a very long 
return on investment) and by the limitation of 
natural resources.
The reform of Tunisian agriculture will only 
bear fruit if it is accompanied by increased 
access to the European market for its export 
products as well as other markets. Within the 
framework of deepening its partnership with the 
EU, Tunisia would be entitled to demand such 
a counterpart since the liberalization of Tuni-
sian agriculture significantly favors the EU. The 
main recommendations to improve performance 
of this sector are us follow:
Revise the investment code to facilitate pro-
cedures and ensure it contributes to achieving 
development goals.
 - Review the process for granting drilling per-
mits to better conserve water resources.
 - Ensure more effective transmission of glob-
al prices to local prices for products with 
regulated prices.
 - Revise the agricultural development strate-
gy for better use of natural resources.
 - Reassess the role of public offices and en-
sure greater private sector participation on 
competitive bases for supplying inputs and 
marketing agricultural products.
 - Establish a foreign marketing strategy for 
agricultural products and develop a com-
mon commercial vision based on a national 
strategy.
 - Simplify procedures for acquiring equipment.
 - Reorganize wholesale markets.
 - Promote better competition to facilitate the 
establishment of agricultural product pro-
cessing units.
 - Stop subsidizing inputs and favor a system 
of direct transfers according to objectives.
 - Clarify the role of the Ministry of Agricul-
ture, which should, in our opinion, protect 
farmers’ incomes rather than “consumers.”

NEW MEDIT N. 3/2024
101
 - Encourage the formation of Mutual Agricul-
tural Services Societies (SMSA). This would 
reduce transport costs and losses, subse-
quently lowering consumer prices, stimulat-
ing both consumption and production.
 - Resolve the financial problems of small 
farmers who have been unable to meet their 
repayment commitments on previous loans.
 - Modify the consumption model of Tunisians 
through appropriate policies to stimulate 
domestic production by changing consumer 
diets. For example, reduce the consumption 
of soft wheat (flour used to make bread, 
which is largely imported), vegetable oils, 
and sugar, which also pose public health is-
sues and increasingly strain the state budget.
6.  Conclusion and policy recommendations
Tunisia agricultural sector is facing new chal-
lenges such as water scarcity, climate change, 
soil degradation, land fragmentation, deteriora-
tion of farmers’ income and consumers buying 
power. The present agricultural policies are not 
efficient to address these challenges. Hence, new 
policies for sustainable food system are needed. 
This comprehensive vision should take into ac-
count the following interventions:
 - Improving the income of farmers in order 
to increase the role of agriculture in reduc-
ing the unemployment rate, fighting against 
poverty, and strengthening the balance be-
tween the different country regions. If it 
wants to achieve these objectives, Tunisia 
should abandon the indirect taxation pol-
icy in the agricultural sector now in place 
in favor of a policy which aims to improve 
the growth of farmers’ income based on a 
greater level of transmission of world prices 
to local producer prices.
 - Reducing the cost of agricultural policy 
and improving its efficiency, because ac-
tually the policy of controlling the prices 
for certain goods, such as cereals and dairy 
products, appears to be heavy and expen-
sive whereas its impact remains limited. In 
general, there is an urgent need to assess the 
effectiveness of the agricultural policy in 
Tunisia and to find alternative mechanisms 
that has to be less expensive, but also more 
effective for the development of the sector 
and improvement of farmers’ income.
 - Shifting the efficiency of agricultural policy 
through the development of infrastructure 
(water, transport network, electricity, dis-
tribution channels...) instead of instruments 
of subsidies to the private direct investment 
currently into existence, which largely con-
tributed to introduce heavy disturbance of the 
agricultural sector without taking into con-
sideration the need to improve equal oppor-
tunities for different categories of farmers.
 - Enhancing the transparency and adaptability 
of agricultural policy to effectively respond 
to international changes impacting the sector.
 - Reforming the agricultural trade policy 
should be placed in the broader context of 
the profound reform of the Tunisian agricul-
tural policy.
 - Empowering programs focus on small farm-
ers with access to affordable credit, techni-
cal training, and modern agricultural tech-
nologies. 
 - Enhancing sector efficiency and productivi-
ty through the adoption of smart agriculture 
using drones, sensors, and hydroponic tech-
niques.
 - Developing investments in the agro-in-
dustry and cold storage facilities to reduce 
post-harvest losses and improve agricultur-
al product management. This helps create 
integrated value chains by processing raw 
materials locally, adding value, generating 
employment, and ensuring price stability for 
agricultural products.
 - Promoting organic production to enhance 
the competitiveness of export products.
 - Promoting reused water and improving 
water use efficiency by implementing high 
technologies such as hydroponics and smart 
irrigation.
 - Adjusting cereal producer prices, especially 
to align with world prices.
 - Enhancing the importance of insurance and 
the National Risk Fund.
 - Promoting the roles of institutional struc-
tures like GDAs, SMSAs, and private com-
panies.

Nitrogen Cycle

Nitrogen cycle
• It is a cyclic process by which nitrogen is
converted between its various chemical forms
1.Nitrogen fixation – atmospheric nitrogen is
converted
in
to
ammonia
or
organic
compounds .
p
2.Nitrification – In this step ammonium ion is
initially oxidized to nitrite ions, subsequently
into nitrate ions ,this process is carried out by
nitrifying
bacteria
such
as
species
of
Nitrospira, Nitrosococcus and Nitrosolobus.

3.Assimilation
• Nitrogen compounds in various forms, such as
nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, and ammonium are
taken up from soil by plants which are then
used in the formation of plant and animal
proteins.
4.Ammonification
• When plants and animals die, it is broken
down by other microorganisms, produces
ammonia which is then available for other
biological processes.

5.Denitrification
• Nitrogen makes its way back into the
atmosphere
through
a
process
called
denitrification, in which nitrate (NO3-) is
converted back to gaseous nitrogen (N2).

Sulphur cycle

Sulphur Cycle
• Sulphur can exist in a variety of oxidation states
(-2, 0, +2, +4 and +6),
within organic and
inorganic compounds .
• Each oxidation – reduction reaction is mediated
by microbes
by microbes .
• Under anaerobic condition H2S is produced from
mineralization of organic sulphur compounds
and this H2S is utilized by microbes.

Small Farmer Uprisings and Rural Neglect in Egypt and Tunisia  
by Habib Ayeb , Ray Bush  
MER272 Volume 44 (fall 2014) 
“We should make it up to the peasants,” Muhsin al-Batran, erstwhile head of the economic affairs unit in Egypt’s 
Ministry of Agriculture, told the official daily al-Ahram two months after the toppling of Husni Mubarak in 2011. 
“Make it up” -- why? And what is it that needs to be made up? 
It is a truism that modern Arab states, following in the footsteps of colonial powers, have concentrated on the socio-
economic development of cities, particularly the capital, and badly neglected the provinces. The rulers and the 
nationalist intelligentsia tend to see peasants as backward and mired in “tradition” that can only impede the progress 
toward modernity that the elites desire. In both Egypt and nearby Tunisia, where Mubarak’s fellow dictator Zine El 
Abidine Ben Ali was also overthrown in 2011, there is a complete mismatch between state agricultural policy and 
rural political consciousness, characterized by strong peasant populism and a strong analytical sense of what is 
behind rural development failures. Small farmers know what policies are needed to grow more food for the nation 
and improve their own standards of living. They vigorously defend what E. P.  Thompson called the “moral 
economy” -- the notion that as small producers living close to subsistence they are owed some protection from the 
ravages of the market. But since the late 1980s, when economic liberalization began in the countryside in both 
places, small farmers have been effectively barred from the conversation about development. 
To date the uprisings have not arrested this historical trend. Elites in Egypt and Tunisia continue to consider 
peasants to be part of the “surplus population,” “human debris” or “waste life,” rather than important actors in social 
transformation. [1] Small farmers are quite aware of their place in the pecking order, and they are fighting back, but 
the arena is severely constricted. As one tiller of the Nile Delta soil noted, “The revolution was good but the dream -
- the dream of freedom, social justice and human dignity -- has not been fulfilled.” In Tunisia after the ouster of Ben 

Ali the persistent refrain of small farmers is likewise that “nothing has changed.”
Farming Without Farmers 
In both Egypt and Tunisia, agricultural policy is based on the twin assumptions that local food production is 
inadequate to feed the population and that the difference should be imported. 

Egypt is the world’s largest importer of wheat, meeting 60 percent of its needs. More than 80 percent of Egyptians 
eat subsidized bread. The subsidies are necessary, since up to 50 percent of Egyptians live on $2 per person per day, 
a figure that probably rises closer to 80 percent for those in the countryside. But the program drains the exchequer -- 
the state spends as much as $4 billion annually, about 3 percent of gross domestic product, on the subsidies -- and 
renders Egypt’s food security vulnerable to fluctuations in international prices. In 2008 wheat prices rose 180 
percent, leading to 15 deaths in bread lines, and the cost of rice imports doubled. 
The trade-based view of food security has driven Egypt and Tunisia to reserve vast tracts of land for production of 
high-value, low-nutrition foodstuffs for export with whatever revenue that is generated being used to import food 
staples. But demand for Egyptian and Tunisian agricultural exports is sluggish. Both countries have tried to pump up 
demand essentially by producing more material for export via mechanization and intensive growth.     
An example is Toshka -- the mega-project launched under Mubarak that saw the Egyptian state dig a channel from 
the Nile Valley to irrigate part of the southwestern desert for agriculture. The declared intent was to induce farmers 
to move out of the “overpopulated” Delta. In reality, the state’s aim at Toshka was to attract foreign investment in 
“entrepreneurial” farms that would grow high-value crops for export. It has failed. The environmental impact 
assessment was inadequate and the early investors from the Gulf are gone. The cost to Egyptians may be as high as 
$86.5 billion between 1997 and 2017, sucking in funds that might have been available for rural development in the 
old lands and might have boosted domestic nutrition. 
The Toshka project is Egypt’s agricultural policy in caricature. It captures the modernist preoccupation with large-
scale schemes and private investment. [2] It also affirms the supposed shortcomings of small farmers in transcending 
the restrictions of traditional agriculture, scale and efficiency. The predominant state-driven narrative is that small 
farmers are doomed: Their non-mechanized agriculture cannot meet local, never mind national, needs. Land 
holdings, in any case, have become unsustainably fragmented because of family inheritance. 
This attitude is the only way to understand the draconian Law 96 of 1992, which completely reordered the 
relationship between landlords and tenants in the Egyptian countryside. Previously, tenant farmers were mostly 
guaranteed protection from arbitrary rent increases and eviction. Between 1992 and October 1997, when the 
legislation was fully implemented, rents jumped by a factor of seven to 22. Rental contracts were broken, and farm 
families lost land rights in perpetuity. Over the next decade, rents rocketed upward again, from 500 Egyptian pounds 
per hectare in 1997 to 2,500 pounds in 2000 and over 4,500 in 2010. Informal contracts replaced written agreements 
and were now limited to one year or one crop season, reducing farmers’ incentive to invest in the land. Female-
headed households were often refused renewal of even temporary contracts. Families became destitute. Malnutrition 
increased, school attendance fell and children were again drafted as day laborers in the fields. [3] As many as 45 
percent of tenants left the land with few bothering to ask where they went; the category of tenant farmer has largely 
been erased from land registries. 
Here lies a paradox. Small farmers in Egypt and Tunisia are among the most productive and clever in the world. 
Egyptian fallahin produce more than 100 quintals of wheat (1 quintal = 100 kilogram) per hectare. In Tunisia’s arid 
southeast, particularly in the Gabes region, farmers demonstrate immense skill and knowledge. Irrigation is 100 

percent dependent upon groundwater, coming from springs in oases and wells in the steppe. Small farmers in this 
region eked out an existence until the early 1990s, when investors undermined them by drilling more wells for their 
large-scale irrigation schemes. 
In Egypt and Tunisia, the state has tried to transform farming, but without consulting farmers. 
Rising Inequality 
The attack on small farmer livelihoods is no unintended consequence of development but the direct outcome of 
policies that reward big landowners and agribusiness. 
Even in the heyday of Nasserist land reform, farmers were viewed as pawns in the drive for industrial growth. 
Without question Gamal Abdel Nasser improved rural conditions. His overall strategy, however, was to coopt and 
even absorb into the state the classes sympathetic to his transformative program -- chiefly, civil servants, industrial 
workers and small, landless farmers. This corporatism perpetuated an authoritarian bias that the Free Officers had 
sought, at least rhetorically, to tame. Nasser refused to mobilize political forces that might turn against him. The 
celebrated land reforms of 1952 and 1961 aimed to limit the size of landholdings but failed to reduce the power of 
landowners. The old class of landowners had strong representation on Nasser’s Higher Committee for the 
Liquidation of Feudalism. Peasants were not trusted to help shape the new agricultural policy and as a result it was 
very easy for powerful rural elites to promote market liberalization before Nasser’s death. This trend accelerated 
with Anwar al-Sadat’s infitah, or open door policy, and culminated in Law 96 of 1992. It gained additional speed 
due to the close relationship between and the erstwhile deputy prime minister and agriculture minister, Yusuf Wali, 
and the US Agency for International Development, which has invested more than $1.25 billion since 1987 in free-
market reform of Egyptian farming. [4] 
The dictatorships of Sadat and Mubarak were also periods of enormous neglect of agriculture. Gross investment in 
Egyptian agriculture fell from 31 percent in 1980 to 23 percent in 1992 and per capita expenditure on agriculture 
declined at a rate about twice the average in the region. 
A hallmark of neoliberal policy in the countryside is rising inequality. Between 1990 and 2000 the number of farms 
smaller than one feddan (an area slightly larger than an acre) increased from 36.7 percent of total holdings to 48.5 
percent. Ninety-three percent of Egyptian farmers till patches of land smaller than five feddans while just 3 percent 
of landowners control almost 35 percent of the total agricultural land with an average holding larger than ten 
feddans. 
Similar patterns of social differentiation obtain in Tunisia. Fifty-four percent of farmers have less than five hectares 
-- in all, these farmers share 11 percent of the total area. Yet those with holdings larger than 50 hectares -- a mere 3 
percent of farmers -- exploit 34 percent of the land area. 
As in Egypt, this differentiation was not natural but a product of neoliberal reform that turned more and more land, 
including state-owned farms, over to private investors from the coastal northeast, or Sahel. After the structural 

adjustment program adopted in 1982, this investment intensified competition between the Sahel and the rest of the 
country over farmland and water. The investors were mainly Tunisians who ran food processing and canning 
facilities for export of olive oil and vegetables. Structural adjustment also exacerbated resource conflict between the 
investors and small and medium-sized farmers. Agriculture -- most production is outside the Sahel -- represents 
about 12 percent of gross domestic product. The inhabitants of rural areas resented the increasing transfer of surplus 
produce to the Sahel for processing. Structural adjustment, finally, meant the erosion of state subsidies to small and 
medium-sized farmers, further exposing these families to market forces. 
Sidi Bouzid, the southwestern town where Mohamed Bouazizi committed suicide on December 17, 2010, triggering 
the revolt against Ben Ali, is illustrative of rural dispossession and wealth transfer. The town sits in a semi-arid zone 
where the locals herd sheep and camels and grow olives, almonds and cereals. The region is highly productive but 
desperately poor, with 42.3 percent of the population living on less than $2 per day in 2011. This “green mirage” is 
the result of the exclusion of small farmers and expansion of water-intensive farming practices -- all in the name of 
food security. Tunisia’s Fifth Five-Year Plan (1977-1981) confirmed the end of collectivism, which had lasted 
roughly from 1964 to 1970. This system had been imposed without consultation and had faced fierce resistance from 
small farmers who felt dispossessed. Large landowners also had feared loss of power and ability to influence 
decision making. The Fifth Five-Year Plan proclaimed a new era of export-led agriculture, to be enabled by the 
rapid development of irrigation funded by private investors. The irrigated sector now accounts for 50 percent of total 
production and up to 15 percent of vegetable production. The total area of irrigated farmland in the Sidi Bouzid 
governorate rose from 2,000 hectares in 1958 to more than 47,000 hectares in 2011. [5] Locals reintroduced the 
label colons to characterize the new capitalists bankrolling this transformation -- though, again, most of them are 
Tunisians. 
Rural Resistance 
There is more to the story of Mohamed Bouazizi’s self-immolation than the struggles of a street vendor insulted and 
abused by the police. The young man’s family had mortgaged their land and, unable to repay the debt, lost their 
livelihood. This story -- farmers who cannot feed the family from tiny plots of land and cannot find supplemental 
work nearby -- is common in both Tunisia and Egypt. 
Common, too, is resistance to impoverishment and dispossession. Much of this opposition to state agricultural 
policy is informal, spontaneous and thus difficult to document. The press is preocupied with urban disputes that are 
assumed to have immediate political and economic impact. But small farmer actions in Tunisia have been extensive. 
On January 14, 2011, the day Ben Ali fled into exile, small farmers occupied lands belonging to the former dictator 
or his family, as well as state lands that Ben Ali had given to private investors. Ten days later, on January 24, 
agricultural workers occupied a large farm near the city of Beja, about 80 miles west of Tunis. The farm had been 
granted to Ben Ali’s nephew and workers now demanded its return to the previous owners. 
Workers occupied more than 100 large farms, many managed by the Society for Agricultural Development, a state 
entity, to demand that the land be returned to them -- the previous farmers. Occupations also took place to disrupt 

planting and harvesting to highlight poor rural working conditions and the need for greater and easier access to land. 
The Ministry of Agriculture noted that protesters took nearly 10,000 hectares of farmland out of production. The 
transitional government introduced symbolic measures to reduce tensions, but mass mobilizations continued. 
There were also a range of disruptions driven by farmers who demanded access to irrigation water. The high cost of 
electricity to run irrigation pumps led to boycotts of payments to the Tunisian Company for Electricity and Gas. In 
May 2011, farmers staged a sit-in for improved access to water, closing Highway 11 at Joumine. In July there were 
further road closures in this area in protest of the “looting” of the company producing mineral water; in August, still 
more highways were blocked in Sidi Othman by residents calling for more standpipes for drinking water. In March 
2012, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Tunisian Union of Agriculture and Fisheries (UTAP) agreed to waive 30 
percent of farmers’ irrigation costs. [6] 
Small farmer protests extended to the issues of costly inputs, low farm gate prices -- the net value of crops when 
they leave the farm -- and marketing and distribution of dairy products in Tunis, Beja and Sfax, among other places. 
Dairy farmers in some governorates dumped their milk in rivers, leading to shortfalls. The absence of effective 
tomato subsidies and low prices at canneries led to several sit-ins in Sidi Bouzid in September 2012 and June 2013. 
One tomato farmer complained, “It’s not the government that subsidizes the farmer. It’s the opposite.” He and his 
peers were hurting so badly that the area harvested fell from 24,000 hectares in 2012 to less than 10,000 in 2013. [7] 
Protests against rural debt began prior to the toppling of Ben Ali. In June 2010, 20 indebted families whose assets 
had been liquidated mounted a sit-in on their land to oppose its confiscation. Subsequently, in July, farmers from 
Regueb and Sidi Bouzid demonstrated in front of the governorate building to protest lawsuits brought against them 
by the National Agricultural Bank that threatened to take their assets, as well. The demonstration was brutally 
dispersed by police. [8] 
Farm workers also undertook several actions to call for improvements in wages and living conditions. In Zaghouan 
farm workers organized a strike with the support of the local branch of the Tunisian General Labor Union (better 
known by the French acronym, UGTT). They demanded higher wages and redistribution of sales revenues. Farmers 
in agricultural cooperatives took steps to obtain a share from the liquidation of units that had been secretly 
transferred. In August 2011, workers from a vineyard in Grombalia struck to demand a pay increase of 100 dinars 
per month and improvements in collective bargaining agreements. [9]  
The farmer and farm worker opposition has surged largely without the backing of the UGTT, in contrast to other 
sectors of the economy, where UGTT support for workers, though uneven, has been greater. Many small farmers 
were affiliated with the UTAP, but this organization primarily served the interests of landowners and investors. In 
2012, after months of conflict, activists frustrated with the UTAP’s continued ties to the ancien regime split to create 
the Farmers’ Union of Tunisia. This new organization brings together medium and large farmers, according to its 
president, Leith Ben Bishr, a farmer from Jendoub, to fill the union void in the agricultural sector. [10] 
It is clear, however, that the Farmers’ Union has no program for defending the interests of small farmers. Ben Bishr 
expresses the need to evaluate grain, milk and meat production and also to examine issues linked to irrigation and 

tomato prices. He concedes that 80 percent of farmers are smallholders with fewer than ten head of cattle and that 
the prices of inputs like animal fodder, soy and corn have increased by 45 percent since 2011. Nevertheless, the 
Union’s policy suggestions, relating to credit, export facilities and pricing for milk, meat and olive oil, as well as the 
composition of its board of directors, seem to replicate the UTAP’s concern with investors and exporters. 
As in Tunisia, coverage of labor unrest in Egypt has focused on the wave of trade union and wildcat strikes. Rural 
disputes are often hidden from public view, but they are also dramatic in their impact. As the twentieth century 
ended and the twenty-first began, the state refused to recognize petitions against Law 96, and rural protest for access 
to land and water intensified. From 1997 onward, there were several celebrated cases involving a new Peasant 
Solidarity Committee linking small farmers, mostly in the Delta, to urban intellectuals and human rights activists. In 
2005, the Hisham Mubarak Law Center, the Adala Center for Political and Social Studies and other Cairo-based 
organizations defended small farmers who had resisted with violence their dispossession by the Nawwar family of 
landowners in Sarandu, near the Delta town of Damanhour. 
According to figures from the Cairo-based Sons of the Soil Land Center, which are not verifiable, in 2009-2010 
there were some 180 sit-ins, 132 demonstrations and six strikes in rural areas, resulting in the arrest of more than 
3,000 farmers and their supporters, as well as more than 2,500 injuries and 400 deaths. [11] This group also 
estimated that there were 2,000 arrests, 220 deaths and 1,500 injuries in such protests in 2010 alone. 
Rural struggles continued after Mubarak fell. In May 2011, farmers from across Egypt demonstrated outside the 
prime minister’s office. Farmer protests have centered around resistance to dispossession and include attempts to 
occupy and retake land that was confiscated, whether with resort to law, subterfuge or violence. Small farmers also 
contested irrigation access and land boundaries. 
Farmers established an independent syndicate to replace the state-run General Union of Peasants and Agricultural 
Cooperative Union. A long time in the making, and founded by veteran activist Shahinda Maqlad, the Independent 
Farmers Union established branches throughout Egypt. In May 2013, one member of the syndicate in the Delta 
expressed hope that the “revolution” might reduce the number of lawsuits filed by landowners to consolidate 
dispossessions. Another tenant farmer could not fathom why his land had been seized: “The worker is fed by me. I 
was feeding Husni Mubarak himself and all of his ministers. So it is shocking to see my two feddans taken away 
from me, just because they are more powerful than me. Are we supposed to die now?” 
But disenchantment came quickly as well with the presidency of Muhammad Mursi, who was seen as unwilling or 
unable to take on the landlords. Peasants tended to distrust the Muslim Brothers, who had encouraged women to 
vote for Mursi with nighttime distribution of cooking oil, sugar and money. One informant said that, during the 
2011-2012 parliamentary elections, a man displayed a carton of ghee he had just received from the Brothers. Such 
tales proved to many small farmers that the Brothers were “only greedy for power.” 
Back to the Future 

Indeed, following the uprisings to unseat Mubarak and Ben Ali, there has been no attempt to recast agricultural 
policy in either Egypt or Tunisia. The neoliberal narrative continues to justify the dislocation and hardship in the 
countryside on the grounds that the best way to boost agricultural exports is to cater to the prerogatives of 
landowners and investors which, for too long, had been subordinated to the interests of tenants paying less than 
market rates for land use. Small farmer interests are shunted aside in the rush in both countries to secure the 
neoliberal status quo. In June 2014, Egypt’s agriculture minister announced the possible reclamation of 1 million 
more feddans over five years in order to resettle 5 million Egyptians. The idea that land shortage is the chief 
problem, rather than the relations of ownership and control on the existing land, is another totem of the decades of 
agricultural decline. 
As concern with rural conditions fades, there is renewed excitement among the elites about the power of outside 
investment -- this time, finance capital -- to enhance food security. The Egyptian firm Citadel Capital, Africa’s 
biggest equity finance company, is grabbing land in Sudan, Uganda and Ethiopia. [12] A consequence of the global 
food-fuel-finance crisis since 2007 has been to affirm the power of finance capital to control all aspects of the food 
chain. 
This relentless commercialization of agriculture has led to the abjection of small farmers. Food insecurity and rural 
underdevelopment will persist until small farmer voices are heard. As one Egyptian woman, head of her household, 
said, “I want my right. I want to live for my children to live. I have four children. I want my right that has been 
earned. My father paid for it with his own blood, health and sweat. How is it that they take it from us? We want 
justice.”

The purpose of this Context Assessment is threefold: first, to characterize the environmental, 
social, economic, and political contexts of the Tunisian Agroecological Living Landscape (ALL); 
second, to understand the data and information currently available in the sub-region of this 
ALL; and third, to characterize the extent to which agroecological principles are already being 
employed locally at the ALL level. This report constitutes a basis of information and discussion 
to conduct an impact assessment. It is also valuable to all WPs in the Initiative as it provides 
critical quantitative and qualitative data and information regarding capacity assessment, policy 
influence, and other environmental attributes that can guide the implementation and impact of 
the Initiative in 2023–2024. 
This Context Assessment in Tunisia has been elaborated from primary and secondary sources of 
data. The primary sources came from focus groups and formal and informal interviews conducted 
in the target area from June to December 2022 as part of WP 1 and WP 4 activities. The secondary 
sources came from previous research and development projects in addition to formal and 
grey literature and technical reports and policy documents. This report will be enriched with a 
household survey planned during the first quarter of 2023. 
This report contributes to Output 2.1, Baseline – current conditions of agricultural systems of 
smallholder farmers in each ALL; Output 1.1 on establishment of the ALL; and Output 4.1 on the 
identification of policies and local institutions and their role in agroecological transition pathways.
The CGIAR Initiative on Transformational Agroecology across Food, Land, and Water Systems develops and scales 
agroecological innovations with small-scale farmers and other food system actors in seven low- and middle-income 
countries. It is one of 32 initiatives of CGIAR, a global research partnership for a food-secure future, dedicated to 
transforming food, land, and water systems in a climate crisis.

Executive summary
Key highlights of the document
The CGIAR Initiative on Agroecology is built around 
the concept and approach of an Agroecological Living 
Landscape as a means to integrate social systems 
and ecosystems at one site to implement and test the 
agroecological transition. The Tunisian ALL over the Kef-
Siliana transect is characterized by deep soil erosion 
problems and effects of climate change (Attiaoui and 
Boufateh, 2019). Conventional practices such as field crop 
monoculture and deep plowing persist and aggravate soil 
and land degradation in the zone, phenomena that are also 
exacerbated by rising population and difficult geographic 
characteristics. Moreover, a significant percentage of 
cropped land is unsuitable for agricultural activities, which 
expedites its degradation. This problem of land and soil 
degradation through erosion constitutes the core concern 
for the co-design of agronomic and livestock management 
practices and this is linked to the agroecological principles of 
soil and plant biodiversity in synergy with livestock activities, 
one of the livelihoods for resilience in the Tunisian ALL. 
 “
Currently, 
regional policies 
have shifted from a 
participatory approach 
toward an inclusive 
and sustainable value 
chain perspective.
From a political perspective, land, water, and forest 
conservation are among the top priorities of national policies. 
Despite the early care about these key resources, limited 
progress in terms of policy design, implementation, and 
effectiveness has been recorded. New challenges of climate 
change, resource scarcity (and degradation), and social 
pressure are adding more complexity to policymaking and 
implementation. Currently, regional policies have shifted 
from a participatory approach toward an inclusive and 
sustainable value chain perspective. A focus on value chains 
has been seen, since the late 2000s, as a means to stimulate 
local economic and social dynamics, while keeping a focus 
on resource protection and preservation. The lack of strong 
administrative expertise on value chains in the regions (and 
locally) made it difficult to properly implement and use this 
approach for local development in rural areas. 
Relevance to the major outcomes of the Initiative 
on Agroecology
Cultivated soil health has been defined as the capacity of 
soil to function within land-use constraints while maintaining 
agricultural production for sustainable food systems along 
the agroecological transition. Therefore, the success of 
maintaining or enhancing soil health (and more generally 
ecosystem health) depends on our understanding of how 
the soil responds to agricultural land use in interaction with 
livestock management. 
The motivation for farmers to investigate soil health is based 
on the goal of improving productivity sustainably and this 
involves an integrated assessment of the physical, biological, 
and chemical components of soil. In this context, soil health 
can be assessed mainly through soil properties that are 
sensitive to changes in management practices such as 
tillage, crop rotation, cover crops, organic matter additions, 
and livestock grazing that strongly influence soil quality 
components and thus crop performance. Social organizations 
and policies are key factors and key influencers of the capacity 
to follow these innovative pathways.
To design more appropriate research and facilitate 
communication with farmers, it is necessary to understand 
their knowledge, perceptions, and assessments of soil 
and soil fertility, economic diversification, and the relative 
resilience of each activity facing climate change. 
The transition of rural territories in Tunisia is considered to be 
potentially supported by the creation and reinforcement of 
farmers’ collectives such as SMSA or GDA that are the more 
recent forms of cooperatives in Tunisia. These structures are 
susceptible to breaking with the logic of “control” of the rural 
population that has prevailed for more than a century in these 
territories and re-drawing the political programs and the roles 
of key actors.
Potential users of the document
This document will be shared and enriched with the 
knowledge of research and development actors involved 
in the Tunisian ALL to cross and combine the several 
perspectives (ecological, agronomic, socioeconomic, and 
political) to have an integrated and common vision of the 
zone and its potential future pathways. In this way, this review 
document will feed the Tunisian theory of change in the 
Initiative.
It will also serve as a basis to co-conceive the core indicators 
for the agroecological transition linked to the Tunisian theory 
of change. A preliminary set of indicators has already been 
proposed.

Location of the Agroecological Living Landscape
The Tunisian Agroecological Living Landscape (ALL), called 
Tunisian Kef-Siliana transect, is located in the semi-arid zone of 
northwestern Tunisia identified as a priority zone by the national 
partners during the national inception workshop of the Initiative 
on Agroecology in 2021 and where mixed cereal-tree-small-
ruminant (sheep and goat) systems prevailed (Figure 1).
The Tunisian ALL was first composed of four farmers’ 
organizations (FOs) in the targeted zone that were selected 
along a gradient of partnerships (with international, national, 
and local partners) and agroecological (AE) technical 
packages. The gradient of partnerships allows testing how 
the degree of fairness, connectivity, and participation built 
over the years will influence the AE transition envisioned 
in the Initiative. Three axes of AE transition pathways were 
pre-identified: (i) the integration of crop-livestock systems 
from seed multiplication to animal product valorization 
toward more autonomous systems resilient to climate and 
price uncertainties, (ii) the valorization of olive products 
and by-products in agroforestry systems through product 
certification and wider by-product valorization, and (iii) the 
promotion of local products (including honey and carob) in 
the agroforestry system as paths of diversification and gender 
inclusion. These three AE transition pathways can often be 
combined at the farm or landscape level linked to family 
activities and their agricultural pattern.
Along with the process of ALL characterization conducted 
with local and national partners, two new FOs joined the 
ALL at the end of 2022. This process led us to consider our 
Living Landscape as a dynamic social living lab embedded 
in the geographic transect Kef-Siliana. This geographic 
transect covers a diversity of landscapes, including the 
plains dominated by cereal-olive-small-ruminant systems to 
the mountainous areas where silvopastoral activities, with 
diversified tree plantations and forest, became dominant. 
(Figure 2)  is a representation of the Living Landscape in the 
selected transect.

The farmers’ organizations embedded in the Living 
Landscape have two main legal forms: SMSA (Société 
Mutuelle de Services Agricoles) and GDA (Groupement de 
Développement Agricole). From a governmental point of 
view, 
“The Law 2005 defines SMSAs as companies with variable 
capital and shareholders constituted by natural and/or 
legal persons carrying out an agricultural activity, fishing, or 
provision of agricultural services in the area of intervention 
of the society. The form of company with variable capital 
and shareholders is a logical consequence of the principle 
of free membership and withdrawal and open doors that 
govern societies/cooperatives” 
(citation translated from Belhaj Rhouma et al., 2018, p. 14). 
In addition, the GDAs are considered democratically 
legitimized local structures, gathering owners and users 
of natural and agricultural resources with some collective 
activities. They can also manage specific natural resources 
on behalf of the state. However, unlike SMSA farmers’ 
organizations, they cannot conduct commercial and lucrative 
(profit-oriented) activities.
The two old FOs (i.e., SMSA Chouarnia and GDA Sers) 
embarked on previous projects that have been part of a 
research and development project called CLCA-2 – “Use of 
conservation agriculture in crop-livestock systems in the 
drylands,” coordinated by ICARDA and funded by IFAD 
during 2018–2021. The main activities developed during that 
project involved the following:
	
{ The implementation and management of zero and 
minimum tillage, crop diversification and rotation with 
forage mixtures, integration of key legume forage crops, 
etc. 
	
{ The introduction of small machines, including mobile 
grinders, handheld seeders, pelleting machines, seed-
cleaning machines, etc., aiming to valorize the crop 
residues from olive production, cactus, wheat bran, etc., 
and making them available for animal feeding.
The SMSA El Rhahla is one of the studied zones of the project 
PROSOL (Protection et réhabilitation des sols dégradés en 
Tunisie), coordinated by the GIZ and DG ACTA,1  around the 
improvement of natural resource management, focusing 
on scaling of soil and water conservation techniques. The 
partnership was being built over 2020–2022. In partnership 
with the national Office of Livestock and Pastureland (Office 
de l’Elevage et du Pâturage, OEP) in the El Rhahla FO, the 
PROSOL project has developed on-farm trials of feed crops, 
especially Sulla and forage mixtures, on very degraded lands 
for animal feeding. 
A new FO, SMSA Kouzira, was selected based on its 
willingness to develop specific markets around its local 
products such as honey, fig confiture, and good-quality 
olive oil. Moreover, this SMSA comprises a majority of young 
people (40% of the members are less than 35 years old) 
and women representing about 70% of the total number of 
supporters. 
These four FOs were the core of the ALL to co-conceive and 
implement technical and organizational innovations along 
three key products and commodities:
1.	 Animal products from seed multiplication and forage 
production/feedstock (with crop/tree residues) to dairy 
and meat product marketing; here, we consider the feed-
food system.
2.	 Olive tree integration with all the other agricultural 
activities (livestock-cereal) through recycling of by-
products, which can support input minimization and 
sustainable intensification. 
3.	 Honey and carob products are increasingly in demand and 
can be produced with good quality in the mountainous 
agroforestry systems. 
In cooperation with a national partner, Institut de l’Olivier, and 
its partners, the Tunisian ALL has been extended to two new 
FOs, Elless and Hamam Badhia, in the ALL. These two FOs 
complement our work on olive oil certification and marketing, 
in addition to valorization and recycling olive tree by-
products for biofertilization, among others. These additional 
FOs have been selected because of the unique characteristics 
of their olive oil, which, despite its premium quality, remains 
undervalued in the market. Labels and certifications are thus 
early steps for such market integration and product valuation.
Finally, the Tunisian ALL comprises six FOs and each would 
be representative of several value chains (mostly for now – 
will be confirmed later – milk/meat, olive oil, and honey), and 
each could illustrate various strengths and weaknesses in 
terms of agroecological principles. We will then search for 
complementary investments in each of these FOs and will 
try to find a way to connect them to create a larger and more 
harmonious ALL.
Environmental context 
Topography, soil, and agricultural land use in  
the Tunisian ALL 
The Kef-Siliana transect covers two governorates 
characterized by a rugged relief and compartmentalized with 
mountain ranges, high and medium plateaus, and alluvial 
plains. Between the plains and the mountainous slopes of 
hard rock, the crusted glacis constitutes transitional areas 
very affected by water erosion (see Figures 3 and 4).

Several studies were conducted to assess soil health in the 
Siliana and Kef regions using different soil indicators (physical, 
chemical, and biological) (see Annex 2). The results of these 
studies showed that the indicators N, P, K, organic matter (OM) 
content, and structural stability were negatively affected by 
cultural practices. They bring evidence that soil health can be 
improved significantly by decreasing tillage intensity, planting 
cover crops, and keeping crop residue, and that biological soil 
health indicators associated with labile carbon and nitrogen are 
most affected by management practices such as tillage intensity. 
However, some conventional practices such as field crop 
monoculture and deep plowing persist and aggravate soil 
and land degradation in the northwestern area of Tunisia, 
negative impacts that are exacerbated by rising population 
and difficult geographic characteristics (Fouzai et al., 2018; 
Attiaoui and Boufateh, 2019). A huge percentage of cropped 
land is unsuitable for agricultural activities, which expedites its 
degradation. This problem of land and soil degradation through 
erosion is also aggravated by overgrazing and pressure on the 
different topographic features, as they are all easily accessible to 
livestock (Jendoubi et al., 2019).
State of natural resources, including current  
exploitation/use
Table 1 presents the natural resources in the Tunisian ALL. The 
two governorates have a noble forestry ecosystem with cork 
oak, Zen oak, and holm oak, among others, with a production 
function, but also with functions of protection for soils and 
surface formations on slopes and protection of downstream 
infrastructure (dams). This ecosystem also has a role in 
improving the regime of water sources and maintenance of 
rare species, while contributing through its permanence to the 
maintenance of the environmental quality in the mountainous 
zones. Nonetheless, this forestry ecosystem is subject to strong 
human and animal pressure. This pressure resulted in (1) a 
decline in cork oak forests; (2) a higher load per hectare from 
two pastoral livestock units per year in 1942 to about five in 1995 
(based on the national inventory from the Inventaire Forestier et 
Pastoral National, IFPN); (3) the high frequency of conflicts and 
infractions in pasturelands (80% of the total infractions); and 
(4) overgrazing in forest rangelands, with rates of 50% to 78% 
(reaching about 3.7 sheep/ha).
Siliana Governorate
Kef Governorate
Forest covers 20% of the 
agricultural lands (Atlas Siliana, 
2013). Because of the relief and 
the natural landscape of the 
governorate of Siliana as well as 
its low rate of urbanization, 
wildlife has been able to develop 
and conserve itself. This situation 
allowed the continuity of hunting 
activity. The main species hunted 
are wild boar, thrushes, and 
starlings. 
A signiﬁcant plant cover extends 
over 24.3% of the region and 
consists of 102,000 ha of forest 
(Aleppo pine, holm oak, cork oak), 
or about 13% of Tunisian forests, 
and 22,000 ha of rangeland. From 
2001 to 2020, Kef lost 3,000 ha of 
tree cover, which is equivalent to 
a 19% decrease in tree cover 
since 2000.
The Sers sector land use can be 
described as follows: 91% arable 
land, 4.8% forest, and 4.2% 
rangeland (Atlas Kef, 2015).

In addition, the natural environment of Siliana Governorate is 
characterized by a poor vegetation cover associated with the 
presence of water erosion, which is considered very severe 
and threatening to soil quality. During the last decades, 
with the intensification of land use and urbanization, other 
problems have appeared, including flooding, sanitation, and 
waste management (Atlas Siliana, 2013). 
For Kef Governorate, 61% of the total area is affected by severe 
and moderate erosion. Three-quarters of the lands are also 
threatened by desertification. Many problems related to waste 
management result from poor infrastructure (Atlas Kef, 2015). 
At a more local level in the ALL, these six sites are exposed to 
many risks, as shown in Table 2. 
In the Tunisian ALL, forms of degradation appear as garrigue 
and steppe formations. These are located on the lands of 
rangelands and are usually the most exposed to human and 
livestock pressure. 
In summary, the natural environment is exposed to various 
risks, such as water erosion and flooding, aggravated by 
increasingly accentuated anthropogenic practices. Water 
erosion is severe there and is sometimes associated with 
landslides. The rugged nature of the relief, the rocky 
outcrops’ tender; irregular, and often torrential rainfall; the 
density of the hydrographic network; and the weakness in 
certain areas of the vegetation cover are conditions that favor 
hydric erosion. Running water that is difficult to control and 
natural conditions favorable to flood risks characterize the 
region.
Climatic characteristics of the Kef-Siliana transect  
in Tunisia
Nationally, the northern region, which benefits from the 
Mediterranean environment, has moderate, wet winters 
and warm, dry summers, with an average annual rainfall of 
600 mm. The central area has precipitation from 200 to 400 
mm/year, where the bioclimatic stage varies from semiarid 
to arid climate, and is characterized by some relatively hot 
temperatures, especially in summer. The climate of the rest 
of the country varies from arid to Saharian characterized 
by hot temperatures as well as a large volume of irregular 
precipitation rarely exceeding 100 mm (Figure 5) (Mansour 
and Hachicha, 2014). 
All over the country, from the north to the south, respectively, 
annual evaporation varies from 1,300 mm to even in excess of 
2,500 mm. Also, drought periods registered and experienced 
can be restricted to one or more regions but they can be 
generalized for the whole country with variability in terms of 
duration and intensity (Louati and Bucknall, 2009).

Siliana Governorate is characterized by a continental 
climate with an average annual rainfall varying from 350 
to 550 mm during the 2017–2018 season. The lowest 
average temperatures in Siliana during the same season are 
recorded from 3.2 to 13.0°C, while the highest is from  
17.9 to 35.7°C (ODNO, 2018a), up to a monthly mean of  
38°C in July 2022. As a result of precipitation and 
temperature variability, the climate is quite contrasting 
in Siliana, which is explained by the influence of the relief. 
The mountainous massifs of the northwestern part of the 
governorate are considered a semi-arid zone, as are the 
southern mountainous sectors. In between, the other 
parts of the governorate have an arid climate, which is 
more significant in the far southern parts where the lowest 
amounts of rainfall and highest temperatures are registered 
(Atlas Siliana, 2013). 
In Kef Governorate, the average annual rainfall varied from 
350 to 450 mm during the 2017–2018 season. The lowest 
mean temperature in Kef recorded during the same season 
was 7.3°C (January), while the highest was 26.5°C (July) 
(ODNO, 2018b). This governorate belongs largely to the 
bioclimatic semi-arid stage. However, some areas in its 
southwest are part of the bioclimatic arid stage and others 
in the north belong to the sub-humid stage. Overall, it has a 
continental climate with cold and harsh winters and minimum 
temperatures among the lowest in Tunisia (Atlas Kef, 2015). 
In summary, the bioclimatic context of these two governorates 
(Siliana and Kef) is similar and comparable, and we can 
consider this transect as a homogeneous entity with some 
internal differences.  
At a more local level in the Tunisian ALL, the six sites are semi-
arid areas with limited precipitation as shown in Table 3. 
Water availability for production
Siliana Governorate has benefited from three large dams 
associated with 38 hill dams that have a retention and 
reserve capacity of 55 Mm3. In addition to the dams, Siliana 
is rich in hill lakes, having 138 hill lakes with 10 Mm³ capacity 
(Atlas Siliana, 2013). For groundwater, 4,167 surface wells 
and 373 deep wells are exploited. Especially in the Tunisian 
ALL, we have contrasting situations. For instance, in the 
Gaafour sector (SMSA Chouarnia), 2,081 ha are irrigated 
(mainly public perimeter). For the Kesra sector, the irrigated 
area is more limited, with a total surface of 198 ha (mainly 
public). In Makthar (SMSA Rhahla), the irrigated perimeter 
of 922 ha is under a private regime (ODNO, 2018a). The Krib 
delegation (SMSA Hamam Badhia) benefits from a network 
of eight hill lakes and one hill dam.
Kef Governorate has a network of 24 hill dams, 71 hill lakes, 
and only one large dam. The quantity of surface water 
mobilized represents only 70% of the mobilizable resources, 
which shows the rather important potential of surface water. 
For groundwater, the water table is overexploited while the 
deep-water table is underexploited (Atlas Kef, 2013).  
In Sers, we found three hill dams and six hill lakes. In 
this same area, 2,850 ha are irrigated (private irrigated 
perimeter), mainly (2,000 ha) from surface wells. Some  
354 ha are irrigated as part of the public irrigated area. Kef 
has 4,685 surface wells and 537 deep wells, of which 1,012 
and 71, respectively, are in Sers (ODNO,2018b).
In summary, the northwestern zone of Tunisia, which 
contains the six sites of the ALL, is considered the most 
important area for olive cultivation and rainfed cereals. 
This transect is one of the most vulnerable regions, 
characterized as having excessive climatic variability. 
Drought and water scarcity are the main risks to agriculture 
and the natural environment, and they influence yield. The 
high temperatures also affect crops in terms of production 
and growth cycle. The impact of growth cycle shortening 
can affect yield both quantitatively and qualitatively as 
a consequence of damage sustained during flowering 
and grain filling. All these events and experiences could 
influence the agricultural calendar (starting from sowing 
and going until crop harvesting) (Mansour and Hachicha, 
2014).

Economic context 
Key farming systems
According to the survey on farm structures in 2004–2005 
(MARH, 2006), Kef Governorate is characterized by a 
predominance of small-scale farming systems. Over all the 
governorate, 35% have less than 5 ha and 58% have less than 
10 ha. Farms with 100 ha or more represent 3% of the number 
of farms and 35% of the agricultural area. The Kef region 
remains marked by the predominance of cereal activities 
based on a production system that is not very intensive 
and strongly depends on climatic hazards. As a result, crop 
yields have remained low (14 to 16 q/ha) and the annual 
production of cereals is quite uncertain. Practiced according 
to an unfavorable crop rotation and technical knowhow, 
this monoculture most often leads to soil exhaustion (loss of 
fertility) and erosion (61% of the total area of the governorate 
is affected by moderate to severe erosion).
Siliana Governorate is characterized by a high population 
density, given its climatic and soil constraints. The scarcity 
of land translates into fragmented land and low operating 
areas (an average of 17 ha per farm and 75% of the farms 
have less than 10 ha). This scarcity of agricultural land is to 
be compared with the existence of a still significant national 
forest, in particular in the delegations of Kesra, Rouhia, and 
Bargou (21% of the area of the governorate). Dry cultivation is 
nevertheless always subject to climatic hazards. Production 
and yield can vary up to 6 times from one year to the next 
(from 2–3 qt/ha to 19–20 qt/ha). Finally, technical progress has 
been concentrated geographically (plains) and socially (large- 
and medium-sized enterprises).
The vast majority of the rural population, except those 
benefiting from irrigation projects, has found it impossible 
to intensify their production systems. To cope with the 
demographic growth, which is relatively low but still 
significant, producers have had to increase the pressure on 
natural resources, pressure that has traditionally resulted in a 
decrease in the fertility of agricultural soils, overgrazing, and 
increased water-borne erosion.
Cereal cultivation for own consumption dominates. 
Arboriculture (olive, fig, peach, and apple) is present, for 
both self-consumption and marketing. This agriculture 
experiences the same problems as those mentioned for farms 
outside forest areas: lack of fertility, sensitivity to drought, and 
risk of erosion. 
Farms in agro-pastoral areas, outside the forest domain, face 
the degradation of rangelands, a decrease in the fertility 
of agricultural soils, and a very strong erosion of hydraulic 
origin. These farms are essentially based on cereal agriculture 
in association with extensive livestock farming. Cereal 
cultivation and the tillage on which it depends promote 
erosion. Erosion has significant consequences on the siltation 
of many dams in the region. The protection of these dams by 
the development of soil and water conservation techniques 
(CES) is a necessity. Apart from their mechanical aspects, the 
soils are often poorly suited to cereals; here, too sensitive to 
drought. Yields are usually low to very low.

Overall, three production systems prevail in the Kef-Siliana 
transect: 
	
{ Dry cereal-based systems with cereal rotation, low 
integration of fodder crops, sheep activity, olive or fig 
trees, and existence of a small number of dairy cows on the 
household farm. 
	
{ Agrosilvopastoral farms dominated by extensive 
management of sheep and goats based on pastoral 
resources; this system can be integrated with dry cereal-
based systems.
	
{ In a few areas, irrigated systems with market gardening 
intercropped with arboriculture, but not a real 
intensification of crop rotation, and the development of 
dairy cow activity. 
Major agricultural commodities and livestock
Table 4 gives a brief description of the farming systems at 
the first four sites of the ALL in Tunisia based on a focus group 
characterization of the ALL realized in September 2022. This 
characterization of the farming systems will be improved 
through a farm typology based on a household survey that 
will be reported at the end of 2023. 
However, we can see that the main agricultural commodities 
are cereals, mainly wheat for food consumption and barley for 
feed consumption, and trees, with olive and fig trees. We can 
also find other plant and tree varieties such as almonds and 
apples for tree plantations and Gramineae and legumes such 
as vetch and Sulla. These two varieties have been developed 
over the past 10 years within several projects such as CLCA 
and PROSOL.
In the irrigated perimeters, farmers also developed vegetable 
crops mainly for sale. 
The quasi-totality of the farming systems also includes 
ruminants, mainly cows for dairy products in the most 
favorable zone with irrigation facilities and sheep and goats 
in the less favorable zones, with sheep mainly for meat and 
goats for milk and meat. Except in the pastureland, manure is 
also collected and used on agricultural lands. In addition, the 
majority of farms raise poultry, mainly to cover the need for 
eggs and meat at the family level. 
Other activities such as beekeeping are developing in the 
zone and constitute a non-negligible source of income.

Table 5: Distance of the sites from the main regional markets (in km).
Market information for both inputs and outputs 
Agricultural inputs are largely subsidized and so the input 
market is largely controlled by the government through 
parastatal enterprises or government agencies, especially 
for fertilizer and seed. Other sectors have known a certain 
liberalization such as in the sector of chemical products for 
weed and pest control. 
The majority of agricultural products are marketed through 
local markets (souks) and the prices follow the rules of supply 
and demand (i.e., their prices are determined by market 
forces). In addition, the marketing of agricultural products 
that are considered strategic goods such as grain and its 
by-products is regulated by the government through public 
enterprises. For instance, cereals are exclusively sold to the 
state-owned Cereals Office, with a monopoly on buying 
locally produced cereal grains and importing cereals from 
the international market. The Office National de l’Huile is in 
charge of buying and exporting locally produced olive oil 
and importing vegetable oil. For cereals and oil, the prices 
are guaranteed at the farm level; government agencies 
have the responsibility to secure the supply through storage 
capacity at the national level. In addition, raw milk is mainly 
sold to dairy cooperatives and collectors who supply dairy 
processing units. However, for strategic and non-strategic 
goods, illegal or parallel markets are tolerated. 
So, at the ALL level, we can distinguish two types of markets: 
the local market in the commune, where farmers can find 
the majority of inputs for agricultural activities and sell some 
agricultural outputs, and the regional markets, especially for 
live animals. 
Table 5 gives the average distance of the communes involved 
in the Tunisian ALL from the regional markets in the two 
governorates. The main market day in the region is Thursday 
although farmers can sell or purchase outside the region.
Key factors affecting agricultural productivity 
Along the Kef-Siliana transect, land degradation and soil 
erosion are the most severe natural and anthropic factors 
affecting agricultural productivity. As mentioned above, 
the landscape is characterized by steep slopes and several 
ravines caused by all types of erosion. Based on a survey 
conducted within the SWC@scale/PROSOL project Towards 
the Effective Scaling of Soil and Water Conservation 
Technologies under Different Agroecosystems in North and 
Central West Tunisia (2020–2023), 62% of the respondents are 
suffering from extreme water erosion problems, especially 
during the autumn rainy season when soils are bare. Also, 
farmers consider that wind erosion has the same impact on 
their land, especially during summertime with hot southerly 
winds (Frija et al., 2022).  
Another key limiting factor is the low and variable 
precipitation, especially in the seeding season (November) 
and before flowering, especially for olive trees (February and 
March) and wheat (April).
Land fragmentation with population growth is another critical 
limiting factor that threatens the socioeconomic viability of 
farms and the social transfer of a viable piece of land to the next 
generation. Furthermore, this problem leads to a significant 
rural exodus of the young generation.
Faced with these natural factors that are exacerbated by the 
anthropic land pressure (with less than 5 ha on average per 
farm), the weakness and lack of training in extension service 
development make farmers feel often alone to face these natural 
challenges. Moreover, land degradation and erosion reduction 
need important infrastructure investments that require state 
interventions through national or international projects. 
Finally, the recent cereal crisis caused by the Ukraine-
Russia war exacerbated the problem of the dependence 
of the agricultural sector on feeds and concentrates in the 
international market. The current shortage of cereals and 
concentrates combined with price increases in legal and 
illegal markets caused some farmers to decrease or even 
abandon some livestock activities, especially dairy cows.

Agricultural financing 
Agricultural financing is usually done through the government 
with special interest rates and conditions for the agricultural 
sector. The national bank for the sector, Banque Nationale 
Agricole (BNA), is the main lending institution. This 
government bank also provides credit to medium-to-large 
farms, with a system of monitoring and supervision of loan 
uses. About 120 regional offices exist, with a majority in the 
northern part of the country.
The BNA also manages special funds such as the Special Fund 
for Agricultural Development (FOSDA), founded in 1963, 
based on government budget allowances. It constitutes a 
major credit source for the agricultural sector. The main issues 
of the agricultural credit system are (as mentioned by Thabet 
et al., 1998): “(1) The existence of a multitude of agricultural 
credit lines with different lending conditions and interest 
rates; and (2) late payments that make debtors ineligible for 
credit.” In addition, some special bank systems have been 
developed to facilitate credit access for small and medium 
farmers. This kind of credit remains under the supervision of 
the Ministry of Agriculture, with support and training from 
agricultural services. Other credit systems are based on 
giving in-kind to small farmers by government agencies such 
as the National Grain Board (Cereals Office) or parastatal 
enterprises. 
 “
Some special 
bank systems have been 
developed to facilitate 
credit access for small 
and medium farmers.
However, this formal credit remains the financial fund for 
medium-to-large farmers. According to ONAGRI (2006), 87.5% 
of the farms nationally haven’t asked for agricultural credit and 
6.2% have asked for a credit that has been refused. So, in total, 
only 6.3% received a formal credit. The demand for credit 
for agricultural campaigns and investment involved 29.9% 
and 18.4% of large farms (>100 ha) and only 3.7% and 5.2% of 
small-scale farms (less than 5 ha), respectively, in 2006.
During the focus groups conducted in September 2022 in the 
Tunisian ALL, other sources of credit systems were identified, 
such as:

Physical and human assets and land tenure situation 
In the Tunisian ALL, the main physical assets of farmers are 
land and livestock in the two governorates (Table 6). A total 
of 98% and 70% of the family farms in the two governorates 
depended on only on-farm activities for their subsistence in 
2004. 
Small livestock holdings (2 to 3 cattle, 14 sheep, and 3 goats 
on average) account for 83.5% of the total livestock and 
represent 67% of the cattle population, 52% of the sheep 
population, and 59% of the goat population. 
Small-scale family farming covers 78% of the total number of 
agricultural holdings and only 43% of the total agricultural 
area (Marzin et al., 2016). A total of 66.8% of the small family 
farms had an area of less than 5 ha and 86.7% had an area of 
less than 10 ha in 2014.

2022, from a large majority of small-scale farms in Chouarnia 
and Kesra to a more diversified profile in Sers and El Rhahla, 
even if the majority of farms have less than 10 ha.
Land tenure has evolved from the 1960s dominated by the 
cooperative system and state farms to land privatization 
during the 1970s. Nowadays, we can mention at least three 
kinds of land ownership: (1) state ownership or state farms to 
secure some strategic goods, (2) private ownership for the 
majority of cultivated lands by family or entrepreneurial farms, 
and (3) collective or state land ownership for pastureland and 
forest.
Land ownership is mainly nuclear family ownership 
transmitted between generations or joint/undivided 
ownership, with more than two adults living in separate 
households. Undivided ownership is very frequent. Land 
transactions exist but are not generalized.

Table 9: Infrastructure access at the four sites of the ALL in Tunisia.
Land tenure has evolved from the 1960s dominated by the 
cooperative system and state farms to land privatization during 
the 1970s. Nowadays, we can mention at least three kinds of 
land ownership: (1) state ownership or state farms to secure 
some strategic goods, (2) private ownership for the majority 
of cultivated lands by family or entrepreneurial farms, and (3) 
collective or state land ownership for pastureland and forest.
Land ownership is mainly nuclear family ownership 
transmitted between generations or joint/undivided 
ownership, with more than two adults living in separate 
households. Undivided ownership is very frequent. Land 
transactions exist but are not generalized.
Supportive infrastructure (roads, electricity, storage)
Table 9 gives a first overview of supportive infrastructure 
in the Tunisian ALL in terms of roads, electricity access, 
and drinking water access. If the electricity network is well 
developed in the ALL, we can see contrasting access to 
drinking water, especially with a lower level in Sers than at the 
other sites. Also, if the sectors of Sers and Gaafour are well 
covered by roads, the sectors of Makthar and Kesra located in 
more accidented relief zones are less accessible.
Social context 
Household structure and size, rural employment,  
and poverty
Nationally, the average rural household size decreased from 
5.7 persons per household in 1975 to 4.3 per household in 
2014 (data from the Recensement Général sur la Population et 
l’Emploi, RGPH, 2014, cited by Marzin et al., 2016). In 2004–2005, 
family labor covered 77.5% of agricultural work days, complete 
with 9% for occasional workers and 13.5% for permanent 
employees. However, these official statistics hide the huge 
contribution of women as occasional workers in the agricultural 
sector. This increasing contribution of women can be attributed 
to the growing involvement of men in multiple non-farm 
activities and also the disinterest of youth in manual agricultural 
tasks. We can also link this disinterest to the growing level of 
education of the young generation, with at least 50% with a 
primary certificate. Vice versa, the increased mechanization 
of agricultural work, notably plowing, had led to a significant 
decrease in the number of permanently paid workers, except for 
entrepreneurial farms. Cited in Marzin et al. (2016), “According 
to the population census conducted by the National Institute 
of Statistics (INS), female employment in agriculture rose from 
13.56% of the total agricultural employment in 1975 to 20.1% in 
1985, 29% in 2005, and 36% in 2012.”
In 2004–2005, the average pluri-activity was estimated at 
48.6%, up to 55.4% for small-scale farms of less than 5 ha, 
and can represent up to 66% of the total income on irrigated 
holdings and up to 90% of total income in rainfed holdings in 
the south (Chebbi et al., 2019).

The national poverty rate decreased from 25.4% in 2000 
to 15.2% in 2015 and 13.8% in 2019 (World Bank, 2022). 
However, rural areas have about 23% of the poor vis-à-vis 
only 9% in urban areas. Moreover, this decline could be 
attributed to a national cash transfer program. However, the 
growing challenge would be labor productivity for the young 
generation to cover the costs of intergenerational solidarity 
(Marzin et al., 2016). 
Contrary to the overall trend nationally, the rural areas of the 
Tunisian ALL are experiencing difficulties linked in particular 
to the rural lifestyle and the lack of infrastructure, especially 
in education and health (Tables 10 and 11). The human 
potential, composed mainly of young people, suffers from a 
high illiteracy rate and a low level of schooling. Poverty and the 
lack of transportation associated with the high unemployment 
rate are the main characteristics of these areas (Shimi, 2014).

Community leadership in the ALL context
The community is composed of large families, themselves 
gathering in a set of households that compose the central 
decision unit for land and farm activity management. The 
community leadership is mainly organized at the village 
(douar) level with a local representative (Omda) at the interface 
between the community and the administration.
A second layer of leadership involves the associations, 
farmers’ associations such as SMSA or GDA with a president, 
and supporters or social associations. An FO (GDA or SMSA) 
is usually created at the level of a social community and an 
agroecological area, both not necessarily homogeneous. For 
example, the GDA Sers is composed of women with and without 
irrigation systems, without necessarily sharing the same local 
network (neighboring). In addition, the SMSA Rhahla comprises 
members of the same extended family. The social composition 
of this SMSA can cause problems when seeking to scale 
concerns because of past social tensions with other extended 
families. So, an FO is embedded in a diverse social system and 
ecosystem case by case. Considering six FOs with various social 
and technical histories can allow capturing agroecological 
transition dynamics according to a certain diversity of social 
and policy configurations. Women are usually well represented 
as supporters or beneficiaries in the FOs. For example, in 
the Tunisian ALL, women represent from 20% to 50% of the 
beneficiaries in mixed FOs, and one FO is managed completely 
by women and the supporters are all women. So, FOs such 
as SMSA and GDA not based on land ownership constitute 
interesting social spaces for women’s empowerment.
FOs and individual farmers with land assets are supported by 
CTV (Centre Technique de Vulgarisation) through the CRDA 
(Commissariat Régional pour le Développement Agricole).
Migration
Nationally, migration movements between major regions are 
quite significant and migrants leave the western and southern 
regions of the country (called “repulsive poles”) to settle in 
the District of Tunis or the northeastern and central-eastern 
regions (“attractive poles”). These movements are explained 
by the decline in agricultural productivity and income from 
agricultural activities and the fragmentation of agricultural land 
(Chebbi et al., 2019). 
Regionally, the migration balance was negative during the last 
decade as we see in Table 12.
In the Tunisian ALL, the departure of the young generation was 
a common concern raised by people of the four sites during the 
focus groups (WP 1, Visioning).

Political context
A brief review of national policies over the last 15 years 
oriented to sustainable development
In 2007, Tunisia developed a national strategy for adaptation 
to climate change for the agricultural sector. Following the 
revolution of 2011, the country began a series of studies 
to develop a comprehensive national strategy on climate 
change (UNFCCC, 2014). In 2011, the government published a 
Livre Blanc to promote a new regional development strategy 
in Tunisia to upgrade backward regions by diminishing 
socioeconomic inequalities. One of the main drivers was to be 
connecting the lagging areas to the advanced areas to exploit 
the spillover and diffusion effects between the regions. 
Politicians used to call this policy “positive discrimination” 
in favor of the least marginalized country areas, which are 
mostly rural with extreme poverty and low provision of 
public infrastructure (and services). This was also a first step 
toward the promotion of the “social and solidarity economic” 
law,2  which was promulgated by the parliament in 2020. A 
major (IFAD) development investment program,3  based on 
opportunities created by this law, was launched to promote 
social and solidarity enterprising in central Tunisia with a total 
investment of USD 51 million, aiming at directly benefiting 
16,800 households in the region of Kairouan. Although the 
law exists in draft form, it has not yet been officially published, 
voted on, or accepted in its full version. This created a legal 
and procedural vacuum preventing the realization of the 
potential benefits of this social and solidarity economy in 
Tunisia. The delayed publication and prioritization of this 
law can also be attributed to shifting political dynamics. 
The government’s attention might be redirected toward 
addressing more immediate and pressing concerns.
The agricultural policy adopted under the 12th Plan (2010–
2014) sought to respond to a certain number of sectoral 
challenges, such as (1) rational and sustainable exploitation 
of natural resources and their protection against overuse 
and degradation; (2) consolidation of food security in 
addition to social security, especially about decreasing 
unemployment rates and migration in rural areas; (3) 
upgrading of the competitiveness of the agricultural sector 
in the face of challenges of domestic market liberalization 
and standard requirements of international markets; and 
(4) the intensification of farmers’ aggregation into different 
forms of associations and organizations, including mutual 
service companies (types of small cooperatives), specialized 
inter-professional groups, and agricultural development 
groups (non-profit farmers’ associations aiming at facilitating 
collective management of natural resources). This last 
program aimed at facilitating farmers’ access to agricultural 
supply of inputs and services, marketing and value chain 
integration, access to public research and extension systems, 
and smooth (and efficient) technology transfer approaches.

A summary description of the strategy can be found at http://www.onagri.nat.tn/uploads/docagri/167-AG.pdf. 
A final objective of this development plan was to (5) improve 
the profitability of agricultural activity, which can make it more 
attractive for investments and thus higher added value and 
consolidated growth over years, etc. In addition, there was a 
growing recognition of the need to take up other emerging 
themes, such as the inequalities and marginalization of 
some regions of the country, employment in rural areas (in 
particular for young people), and the weakness of farmers’ 
organizations as well as the pressure on natural resources 
(soil, water) and purchasing power, thus affecting food 
security and human health. The previous policy objectives of 
the 12th Plan (2010–2014) recognized these weaknesses and 
were trying to support a transition pathway toward a more 
efficient and sustainable agricultural sector.  
The following five-year economic and social development 
plan for the period 2016–2020 (13th development plan) aims 
at “Increasing the agricultural sector’s contribution to the 
national development effort.” Seven strategic axes have been 
considered as a priority for policymakers: 
1.	 The development of natural resources, their sustainability, 
and the mitigation of the impacts of climate change 
2.	 The regularization of key problematic land tenure 
situations that are leading to land insecurity and a 
respective lack of private investments, whose objective 
is to also cope with the fragmentation of agricultural land 
and allow the optimization of the exploitation of public/
collective lands 
3.	 Promotion of agricultural production systems, 
strengthening their competitiveness, developing their 
capacity of resilience to climate hazards, and ensuring 
their sustainability 
4.	 Stimulation of private agricultural investments and their 
related financing services and schemes 
5.	 Promotion of small-scale agriculture, family farming, and 
strengthening its role in rural development 
6.	 Promotion and dissemination of knowledge and 
innovation in the agricultural sector 
7.	 Improving governance in the agricultural and fishery 
sectors.
A strategy for the development of the organic agricultural 
sector had been elaborated for the five-year plan 2016–2020. 
This strategy aimed to strengthen the contribution of 
professionals in the organic agricultural sector and to work 
on major axes such as the added value of the sector, the 
preservation of the environment, and health. Along this line, 
the label “Bio Tunisia” was established with the promulgation of 
Decree No. 2010-1547 of 21 June 2010.
A water and soil conservation strategy has been defined 
and promulgated to address adaptation to climate change 
and biodiversity protection (Sghaier and Neffati, 2017). The 
2050 global strategic framework for the new Agricultural 
Land Conservation and Conservation Strategy (ACTA) 
was as follows: “Prosperous rural areas, having supported 
their development in productive agriculture sustainably 
managing natural resources, and resilient to climate change, 
established through SWC production-oriented practices 
that are implemented and shared by farmers” (DGACTA/
MARHP, EU, 2017). Within the DG ACTA (2050) strategy that 
promotes agroecological practices (conservation agriculture, 
agroforestry, simplified crop techniques, no-till, direct 
seeding, permanent soil cover, etc.), agroecology is identified 
as a means to cope with water erosion, improve soil quality, and 
consequently contribute to an increase in agricultural yields.
 “
The same ACTA 2050 
Strategy recognized the 
need to develop innovative 
business models (based on 
social promotion and support 
for collective development 
of investment proposals 
by local communities) to 
support and sustain the 
scaling of agroecological 
practices and innovations
In addition, the National Strategy for Sustainable 
Development (NSSD) (ME, 2011) highlighted the first 
challenge – “to establish sustainable consumption and 
production” – and has included in its strategic choices 
“Promoting friendly farming ecological balance and adapted 
to changing climate.” Challenge 3 of the strategy was to 
“sustainably manage natural resources,” one of whose 
strategic choices is the conservation of biodiversity. The 
same ACTA 2050 strategy4 recognized the need to develop 
innovative business models (based on social promotion and 
support for collective development of investment proposals 
by local communities) to support and sustain the scaling of 
agroecological practices and innovations. 
Tunisia’s Ministry of Environment and Sustainable 
Development submitted the country’s INDC in August 2015: 
“Overall, the INDC is a well-crafted policy document, which 
presents a 41% decrease in its carbon intensity emissions 
target by 2030 (starting year 2010) covering the energy, 
industrial processes, agriculture, forestry and other land 
use, and waste sectors” (Ministère de l’Environnement et du 
Développement Durable, 2015). It outlines funding needs 
of more than USD 17.5 billion for the period 2015–2030, 
primarily for implementation of the Tunisian Solar Plan, a 
transformational electricity sector plan for renewable (mostly 
solar) energy use in rural areas (for agricultural activities), 
which is also being widely supported by the national policy.

More information about these priorities can be found at http://www.iresa.agrinet.tn/announce/PrioritesRechercheAgricole%202030.pdf 
In 2018, the agricultural research priorities for 2030 had been 
set by IRESA5  following a participatory approach that involved 
farmers and farmers’ organizations and development, 
extension, and research actors. Targeting research for 
impact, constraints and research needs communicated by 
farmers had been transformed into research themes that were 
grouped into six priority research programs: (1) improvement 
of the efficiency of production systems and development 
of their resilience, (2) protection of natural resources in the 
context of climate change, (3) improvement of fishery and 
aquaculture production systems, (4) better management 
of forests and collective rangelands, (5) empowerment of 
rural populations and agricultural policies, and (6) farmers’ 
organizations and promotion of agricultural and fishery 
value chains. Agroecology is among the research priorities. 
In addition, IRESA has been coordinating since 2018 the 
reform of the training programs of the engineering cycle for 
seven disciplines. The objective of this work was to update 
these programs based on the needs and expectations of 
the socioeconomic environment and emerging challenges 
such as climate change. Agroecology has been included in 
education programs. Therefore, the targeted deliverables are 
skills and training referential. These efforts are promoted by 
IRESA and its institutions to render research more impactful 
in the agricultural sector and to improve the employability of 
agricultural diploma holders. Furthermore, co-generation 
and sharing of knowledge are both subjects of high interest 
to policymakers in Tunisia, who are working on finding 
innovative and effective approaches for technology transfer 
and for filling the gap between research and development. 
The Initiative on Agroecology has a role in many national and 
regional (African) dialogues aiming at enhancing the co-
design and transfer of technological innovations.   
Based on this rapid review of agricultural and environmental 
policies and their main priorities, we have allocated one or 
zero to each principle of the AE framework when a given 
policy addresses or does not address the principle. Figure 6 
gives an overview of the main principles guiding the national 
policies for the three successive periods over the last 15 years.
Figure 6.  Agroecological principles considered in different national policies for the three periods, 
with three programs before 2010, five programs for 2011–2015, and three programs for 2016–2022.

Regional policies
Land, water, and forest conservation are now among the 
top priorities of national policies. Despite the early concern 
about these central resources, limited progress in terms 
of policy design, implementation, and effectiveness had 
been recorded. New challenges related to the frequency of 
extreme climate events, resource scarcity (and degradation), 
and social pressure are adding more complexity to 
policymaking and implementation. 
A participatory approach has been used at the regional 
and local levels since the early 1980s, in which the local 
communities have been considered as the central players 
of any development action, and were consulted (mapped/
identified) before undertaking development actions and 
investments. This has led to mixed performance and results, 
with some cases of success and others of failure. 
Policies in the regions have now shifted from a participatory 
approach toward an inclusive and sustainable value chain 
(VC) perspective. A focus on value chains has been seen 
(since late 2000) as a means to stimulate local economic 
and social dynamics while keeping a focus on resource 
protection and preservation. The lack of strong administrative 
expertise on value chains in the regions (and locally) made 
it difficult to properly implement and use this approach for 
local development in rural areas. Thus, the outcomes of 
these policies (and in current development and investment 
programs) were also mixed, at least so far.  
As a complement to the value chain approach, the transition 
of territories in the Tunisian mountains is considered to be 
potentially supported by the creation and reinforcement 
of farmers’ collectives. These structures are susceptible to 
breaking with the logic of “control” of the rural population 
that has prevailed for more than a century in these 
territories.
At a more local level, the Tunisian ALL is concerned with 
some regional development programs as described above 
(value chains, social enterprising, ACTA 2050 for soil and 
water protection through sustainable financing models, 
etc.) in addition to other direct incentives (subsidies) 
provided especially to farmers operating under irrigated 
conditions (having access to a private or collective source of 
water). A national inventory of ongoing AE projects (WP 5) 
shows that these zones (Siliana and Kef) are already the local 
target of other programs (Table 14).

Mapping regional policy actors involved in  
the ALL in Tunisia
Here, we propose to start figuring out the policy involvement 
of the 500 stakeholders who already participated in the 
different events of the Initiative on Agroecology (either for 
coordination and planning meetings or for focus groups, 
trainings, and policy dialogues) (Figure 7). Proxy variables to 
reflect the level of policy involvement and influence of these 
involved actors were developed. The four (policy-oriented) 
dummy variables each represent one of the following 
categories of actors: 
	
{ No policy influence
	
{ Indirect policy influence
	
{ Direct policy influence 
	
{ Policy changers/drafters
Descriptive statistics of these variables for the total sample 
of 500 involved stakeholders generated some insightful 
information, which can be used during the remaining initiative 
implementation period for active policy engagement and 
changes. The results of this “policy-oriented stakeholders’ 
mapping” exercise are shown below. 
Figure 8 shows that 61% of the involved (beneficiary and 
participant) actors in the different Agroecology Initiative 
activities have no policy influence. These are mostly farmers 
and farmers’ associations, which are supposed to be 
“policy-takers” because of their low level of organization 
and lobbying, respectively.  Some 34% and 4% of the 
actors involved have indirect and direct policy influence, 
respectively. Finally, only 0.5% of the involved actors are 
actually “policy changers.” This shows that more efforts need 
to be made to increase the participation and engagement of 
actors who have a direct effect on policy changes, including 
actual policymakers and changers in Tunisia.

The same 500 actors were also characterized based on their 
respective roles in terms of territorial development. Each 
of these actors, depending on their administrative position 
(or type of activity locally), was given one of the following 
functions (Schulp et al., 2022)6:

{  Advice
	
{  Subsidies
	
{  Implementation-advice combined
	
{  Advice-regulation combined

Results of the territorial analysis show that most of the 
involved actors in our ALL in Tunisia are working on 
implementation, advice, and advice-subsidies combined, 
respectively.

The current state of agroecological 
principles in the ALL
Recycling
Principle: The recycling principle aims to enhance the use and 
valorization of local renewable resources (nutrients, biomass, 
or water) while respecting as far as possible the resource 
cycles (Wezel et al., 2020). The recycling principle can be 
extended to seed and breed renewal management at the 
farm or agroecosystem level (FAO, 2019).
In the Tunisian ALL: The targeted farm systems in the 
Tunisian ALL are fundamentally mixed integrated crop-tree-
livestock systems in which the crop residues from annual 
and perennial crops are used in the feeding management of 
animals, which in turn provide a part of the nutrients (mainly 
manure) for soil fertility management (that can be captured 
by the percentage of crop residues in the feed requirement 
or the percentage organic fertilizer in total N supply for soil 
fertilization management). Over the past 20 years, national 
and international research have sought to optimize this 
biomass valorization. For example, at the end of the 1990s, 
ICARDA, through the Maghreb-Mashreq project (1995–2005), 
conducted research and development activities to valorize 
the cactus pads and the feed blocks made from crop and 
tree residues in the feed requirement of small ruminants. This 
research was conducted in mixed crop-livestock systems in 
the central part of Tunisia. If the feed block technology has not 
obtained the expected success, the use of cactus pads has 
become a common practice. More recently, in the Tunisian 
ALL, we can cite the adaptation of mechanization through 
the pellet machines in the PROSOL project (2020–2023) 
for increasing the consumption rate (and decreasing feed 
wastage) and enhancing the palatability of crop residues. 
This technology allows valorizing tree and crop residues, 
especially olive pomaces and stems. The CLCA project 
(2017–2022) proposed and developed grazing practices 
in agricultural conservation innovation (conservation 
agriculture) allowing both to valorize the vegetable biomass 
in the plot and to enhance soil fertility through manure. In 
parallel, in the whole country, we can see increasing research 
work on water recycling through increasing water storing or 
exploring the governance and social challenges in the use of 
treated wastewater in agriculture (Bahri and Brissaud, 1996; 
Brahim-Neji et al., 2014; Frascari et al., 2018). 
Gaps 
Relating to the use and valorization of local renewable 
resources, if the desk review of past and recent projects put 
the accent on feed rations using local resources, the majority 
of the feed rations were obtained with a staple feed such 
as barley for small ruminants and concentrates for cattle, 
without envisaging a substitution of these products that 
depend partially on importation. A few pieces of literature 
tried to gain an idea about potential valorization through the 
complementarity of crop and tree residues between regions. 
Generally, little is known about the income generation of the 
exchange of by-products largely considered as sub-products. 
From farmers’ perspectives, the use of residues or manure 
was largely considered a traditional practice to face shocks 
and not an innovative practice to support sustainable agro-
food transformation.
Regarding seed and breed renewal management at the farm 
or agroecosystem level that represents traditional practices 
largely practiced by women, up to recently, this domain was 
not the priority of national research focusing on seed and 
breed performance more than renewal management.
The main issues in recycling wastewater in agriculture come 
from two orders: the local organization between farmers and 
the high development (not always controlled) of private wells 
and forages.
Priority-innovations 
Because of the dramatic increase in cereal prices in Tunisia 
since 2022 (linked to the Russia-Ukraine war), the feed supply 
of livestock is widely threatened. If farms have started to 
destock animals, regional and national government agencies 
are actively seeking all opportunities to substitute these 
structural cereal imports with local and national production. 
Notably, they would like to emphasize leguminous crops such 
as Sulla or vetch producing a large amount of biomass. Also, 
national research institutes such as Institut de l’Olivier work on 
the technologies of compost and biofertilization to decrease 
chemical fertilizer purchases. These different options also 
aim to meet the increasing challenge of climate change with 
repetitive droughts in semi-arid areas.
In addition to these options that will be further investigated 
and supported by the Initiative on Agroecology, we proposed 
to explore plant species and agronomic practices (such as 
legume-Gramineae associations and intercropping with 
fruit trees) that produce both food and feed nutrients. The 
multiple crop and tree residues (such as barley bran, straw, 
olive pomaces and stems, etc.) can be recycled through 
grinders and pellet machines to constitute nutritive feed 
rations for animals as a substitute for concentrates or grains. 
The recycling activities with the crop and tree residues will 
be assessed at the farm and local (or regional) level to favor 
complementarities and economic valorization through 
market or social exchanges.
Water recycling will not be directly addressed in the Tunisian 
ALL knowing that the majority of the rural communities 
in the ALL are in the rainfall zone with little or no water 
supplementation. If drought is one of the main concerns, the 
Initiative proposed to focus on practices to cope with it.

Input reduction
Principle: The input reduction principle proposes to decrease 
the use of chemical inputs that negatively affect human, 
animal, and soil health and to increase the self-sufficiency and 
resilience of rural families by decreasing the dependency on 
purchased inputs. This input reduction is part of the research 
on economic efficiency by seeking to optimize production 
with minimum inputs.
In the Tunisian ALL: As in the majority of North African 
countries, mixed crop-livestock systems strongly depend on 
barley grain for sheep and goats, concentrates for cattle, and 
chemical fertilizer or treatment for crops. The use of these 
inputs has been intensified to increase production and ensure 
relative food autonomy (inspired by the Green Revolution). 
However, this increase in input use largely depends on input 
importation nationally and agricultural subsidies at the 
farm level. Now, with the world price increase for cereals 
and fertilizer and the financial crisis in Tunisia, this model is 
strongly questioned and challenged.
Moreover, Tunisia is familiar with the dramatic sequence of 
dry years in the semi-arid zones where the main production 
of grain cereals, meat, and milk for domestic consumption 
and olives for exportation is concentrated. The water concern 
is not new. Research on water use and efficiency has been 
strongly developed in Tunisia. The majority of this work 
sought to quantify how much water use could be diminished 
without altering the production level and quantities of other 
inputs used (Dhehibi et al., 2007; Frija et al., 2012; Chebil et al., 
2014).
Gaps
However, the reality is quite contrasting when comparing 
rainfed and irrigated zones. If the irrigated zone has known 
an increasing use of chemical inputs, especially for vegetable 
crops, the use of external inputs has remained relatively low 
in the rainfed zone, notably linked to the permanent risk of 
drought. The main input is grain subsidies to feed the animals. 
So, in this rainfed system, the main input reduction practices 
should not be sought automatically in the reduction of input 
use but rather in the substitution of high-cost inputs by low-
cost inputs. 
Priority innovations
In the Initiative on Agroecology, priority has been given to 
innovations that decrease the dependence on purchased 
inputs, with permanent attention given to soil fertility 
maintenance. For that, we propose to work on manure 
collection and its valorization through compost and the use 
of biofertilizers. These technologies, especially compost, 
received the maximum score for demand in the Tunisian 
ALL during a regional meeting with five of the six farmers’ 
organizations in the ALL (regional meeting with the six FOs in 
February 2023).  
A second axis is for agronomic practices, notably legume-
cereal association and rotation, to increase biomass 
production for both feed reduction for livestock maintenance 
and soil preservation. 
Alternative practices such as pastureland improvement 
through tree plantations (cactus, carob) are explored. The 
objective is to increase feed autonomy and preserve the 
natural environment.

Soil health
Principle: The soil health principle aims at improving organic 
matter management and soil biological activity to favor 
vegetation growth.  
Tunisian ALL: Several studies were conducted to assess soil 
health along the Kef-Siliana transect (Tunisian ALL) using 
different soil indicators (physical, chemical, and biological). 
Soil texture was investigated in the study of Moussaoui et al. 
(2010) as a physical indicator to evaluate the impact of land 
degradation by erosion in the Siliana region. Masghouni 
(2018) also studied the effect of vegetation cover on soil 
properties in the Siliana region. The results of this work 
showed that soil under plant cover positively affects physical, 
chemical, and biological indicators. Other work has focused 
on the effect of minimum tillage or reduced tillage on 
physical, chemical, and biological indicators in both the Kef 
and Siliana regions (Jemai et al., 2012, 2013). The results 
of this work showed that soil health can be improved by 
reducing tillage intensity, planting cover crops, and keeping 
crop residues and that biological soil health indicators 
associated with labile carbon and nitrogen are most affected 
by management practices such as tillage intensity. Allani et al. 
(2022) showed that the factors that influence the dynamics of 
nitrogen and phosphorus at this study site are essentially the 
physicochemical properties of the soil, such as texture, clay 
content, structure, and soil nature.
 “
The results 
of this work 
showed that soil 
under plant cover 
positively affects 
physical, chemical, 
and biological 
indicators.
In the Kef region, Rezgui et al. (2014) studied the effect of 
tillage and crop type on physical soil properties such as 
bulk density, structural stability, soil moisture, and porosity. 
Indeed, no-tillage enriches the soil with organic matter 
and therefore improves structural stability. However, the 
cultivated species significantly affected the physical and 
water parameters of the soil. The highest values of bulk 
density and structural stability were observed at the level 
of Faba bean crop conducted in no-tillage. This species 
benefited more from the effect of straw residues left by the 
previous durum wheat crop. 
In summary, “Results from the CLCA project in Tunisia showed 
that CA can increase yields a few years after adoption and 
make crops more resilient to changing climatic conditions 
(Cheikh M’hamed et al., 2018; Bahri et al., 2019). CA can 
reduce drought effects through better water storage and 
availability during the crop-growing season in wheat-based 
systems (Mrabet et al., 2022)” (citation by Dhehibi et al., 2023).
Gaps 
Soil health and its management through agronomic practices 
has been comprehensively studied over the last decades, 
notably linked to soil fertility degradation that constitutes one 
of the major problems in the zone. However, the alternative 
plant species or practices proposed over the different 
projects (for example, CLCA, 2017–2022) require significant 
support in seed supply and machines. 
Second, if the majority of soil health indicators were 
addressed in the Kef and Siliana regions by physical indicators 
(such as texture, structure, bulk density, porosity, and soil 
moisture), chemical indicators (such as soil organic matter 
content, CEC, nitrogen content, phosphorus content, 
potassium content, and CaCO3 content), and biological 
indicators (such as microbial biomass and microbial biomass 
activity), all these indicators have been determined by 
researchers for specific purposes and do not reflect farmers’ 
knowledge. It is therefore imperative to study the farmers’ 
perception of the indicators of the health of their soil.
Priority innovations
First, crop-livestock integration and diversification can 
play a role in enhancing soil health through organic matter 
(soil structure), worms, and microbial flora (soil texture and 
biology). Intercropping systems, agricultural conservation, 
and soil conservation practices allow the conservation of 
soil humidity and activity. All these options will be explored 
and re-modeled with farmers according to their needs and 
practices to fit better with their priorities and constraints. 
Second, we propose to study the farmers’ perception of 
soil health to share a common language between research 
and development and facilitate the transfer of agronomic 
innovations to farmers. 
Animal health
Principle: The animal health principle covers two dimensions: 
health and welfare (Wezel, 2020; FAO, 2019). Animal health by 
itself is indicative of the capacity of the animals to fulfill their 
normal functions (also viewed as the absence of diseases) 
although the animal welfare approach focuses on the well-
being of animals in terms of living conditions and treatment 
(and then refers to the satisfaction of the physiological and 
behavioral needs of animals).
November 2023  |  Context Document [Tunisia]  39

Tunisian ALL: Until recently, animal health in Tunisia was 
mainly a matter of the veterinary services organized in 2001 
under three main organizations: 
1.	 La Direction de la Santé Animale (DSA) is in charge of 
the control of animal diseases in terms of the design 
of strategies and guidelines, evaluation of animal 
health programs, management and promotion of 
epidemiological surveillance networks, and control and 
supervision of the practice of veterinary medicine.
2.	 La Direction de la Normalisation et du Contrôle Sanitaire 
aux Frontières (DNCSF) sets out health rules and 
regulations for animals and animal products for export 
and import, and ensures epidemiological vigilance of 
transboundary animal diseases. 
3.	 La Direction du Contrôle des Produits Animaux et de la 
Qualité (DCPAQ) is in charge of defining quality criteria 
for animals, animal products and their derivatives, 
fodder, and additives. In 2014, the National Animal 
Health Surveillance Center (Centre Nationale de Veille 
Zoosanitaire, CNVZ) was created. 
Each animal production district (called APA) is divided into 
a specific number of districts, corresponding to the division 
of the governorate into delegations. Each APA is defined 
according to the number of animals and includes one or two 
delegations under the general direction of CRDA. This APA 
covers both animal production and health.
 “
Many international 
programs have been 
implemented to 
strengthen the national 
framework and network 
of animal health.
Many international programs have been implemented to 
strengthen the national framework and network of animal 
health. We can mention two twin programs with the European 
Union in 2012 and 2022. However, from a rapid appraisal 
assessment of the animal health situation in Tunisia (Gharbi 
et al., 2020), one major issue was that “The farmers do not 
know against which diseases their animals are protected and 
when these vaccines expire” (p. 6). Also, it is mentioned that 
“The relation between the farmers and the veterinarians (field 
or governmental) is still very archaic and simple” (p. 7). So, at 
the interface with farms, the CLCA project organized specific 
training on animal feed and animal health. This training 
was conceived under the new approach of OneHealth to 
promote an integrated approach to health linked to animal 
management and their environment.
Gaps
When it comes to transitioning toward more agroecological 
practices in the area of animal health, the main idea is that we 
expect farms to decrease their reliance on classic tools/means 
that might affect ecosystems as well as human health. In other 
words, we should target innovations that aim to solve animal 
health problems without affecting human and environmental 
health. 
Priority innovations
To close the gap, different research and development axes 
will be explored in the Initiative on Agroecology, such as
1.	 Introducing new/improved schemes for vaccination 
against major pathogens. The transition here is the 
gradual move from chemical and antibiotic treatments 
toward vaccinations.
2.	 Using acaricides and anthelmintic molecules with the 
lowest withdrawal periods for meat and milk (safer 
products).
3.	 Using acaricides and anthelmintic molecules that are less 
detrimental to the environment (fewer residues in soil and 
water; example of the effect of the molecule ivermectin on 
soil health).
4.	 Adopting new hygienic practices to diminish the use 
of chemicals against pathogens and disease vectors; 
such new practices mean less use of chemicals and their 
effectiveness can be assessed by their effect on the 
incidence of respiratory diseases, neonatal mortality, and 
incidence of udder diseases.
5.	 Adopting improved, integrated herd-health strategies 
for the control of endemic diseases with decreased 
reliance on the use of chemicals (for instance, adopting 
an integrated and rational program of preventive 
anthelmintic treatments at local/community levels to 
prioritize strategic treatments and significantly decrease 
risks of strong infections).
The level of complexity to implement and assess such 
practices is variable. However, increasing awareness among 
the target communities and the main players in the field of 
animal health will help to push these concerns toward the 
desired agroecological transition. Research to fill some gaps 
is also required, especially when it comes to points 4 and 5.
Biodiversity
Principle: The biodiversity principle aims at enhancing the 
diversity of plant and animal species to maintain the overall 
agroecosystem according to the principle of the diverse 
functional contribution of each species to the ecosystem. 
In the Tunisian ALL, the main crop-tree-livestock system 
is composed of some subsystem species diversity such 
as wheat, barley, vetch, or other annual crops in the crop 
subsystem; sheep, goats, cattle, or even bee species in the 
livestock subsystem; and olive with fig or almond trees for tree 
plantations. To this farm diversity, we can observe biodiversity 
in common spaces such as forests or pasturelands. Erouissi et

Zied Idoudi / ICARDA

al. (2011) also analyzed the biodiversity of soil invertebrates to 
compare different agronomic practices such as conventional 
vs. no-tillage (NT) management. The results showed that NT 
enhanced the soil fauna populations either in diversity or in 
abundance at the targeted sites of Kef and Siliana. 
Gaps 
If the diversity of plants and animals is a characteristic and 
component of the mixed crop-tree-livestock systems in the 
semiarid zones of Tunisia, AE transformation seeks to favor the 
synergies between organisms and their functions. The second 
gap is the recognition and valorization of this biodiversity. In 
an olive-growing context characterized by the co-existence 
of various intensive and extensive cultivation systems, several 
traditional olive-growing regions, such as those concerning 
the Initiative on Agroecology in the north of Tunisia, require 
new techniques to be able to subsist in a competitive market. 
Low yields, traditional agronomic practices, lack of water 
availability, small size, and in some cases age of plantations 
(several hundred or even thousands of years old) are among 
the most important reasons that make it necessary to look for 
new forms of valorization. The specialization of olive-growing 
activity based on existing local resources and taking into 
account the particular socioeconomic context is suitable for 
many northern areas such as Ellès-Sers (Le Kef). However, the 
conservation of this biodiversity requires more knowledge 
and organization. 
Priority innovations
Biodiversity will be addressed through the use of multi-
species in crop, tree, and livestock systems and the degree 
of association and/or integration at the plot/farm level. In 
association with the soil health principle, the diversity of 
plant species and plant-soil-microorganism interactions 
promote soil biodiversity. This multi-species diversity will 
also be analyzed regarding the sensitivity and resilience 
of the introduced or developed species to dry events. 
Second, pastureland constitutes a reserve of biomass 
and healthy plants for ruminants and humans to improve 
nutrient availability (including healthy products such as 
medicinal plants, natural honey, etc.). Finally, the Initiative on 
Agroecology also proposed to valorize the local knowledge 
around traditional plants and trees such as carob in Kesra or 
melliferous plants in the forests to feed animals.
In the olive sector, biodiversity conservation requires several 
tasks linked to identifying, describing, and using the existing 
local genetic resources, often represented by a limited 
number of specimens of ancestral cultivars. Linked to other 
agroecological principles (such as the connectivity principle), 
we propose to explore and seek the implementation of any 
form of labeling, such as geographical indications, that takes 
into account local practices and environment. 
Synergy
Principle: The synergy principle supposes positive ecological 
interactions from the diversification and integration of 
species and practices in agroecosystems. 
In the Tunisian ALL, these positive ecological interactions 
in the agroecosystems have been mainly studied through 
different agronomic practices such as cereal-legume 
associations, rotation, or plowing practices and their 
positive ecological interactions, in particular on soil health 
(see Dhehibi et al., 2023). Other research work highlighted 
the positive contribution of livestock integration thanks to 
manure and the role of animals in biodiversity preservation 
through grazing practices. Beekeeping is also a major activity 
in the Tunisian ALL that favors synergies among plants, 
animals, and humans. 
November 2023  |  Context Document [Tunisia]  42
Zied Idoudi / ICARDA

Gaps 
Linked to past evidence that diverse crop rotations and their 
integration over time support plant diversity, which helps 
break up soil-borne pest and disease life cycles, improve 
crop health, help manage weeds, diminish nutrient losses 
from soil, and improve soil health (Larkin, 2015), agronomic 
research needs to invest in more complex cropping systems 
with diverse plants in time and space to support diverse food 
webs and energy chains essential for cropping systems and 
microbial activity in soil.
Priority innovations
This synergy will be addressed through different mechanisms:
1.	 At the farm level, diverse crop rotations and associations 
will be co-conceived with farmers and analyzed in terms of 
energy chains (mainly biomass production) and microbial 
activity in soil.
2.	 Healthy soil requires active decomposition, nutrient 
cycling, and soil functions, which can be accomplished 
with crop rotations, cover crops, and organic matter 
amendments. Therefore, technological packages 
including agronomic practices and soil nutrient 
management practices will be co-conceived.
3.	 At the territorial level, livestock grazing management 
enhances ecological balance/interactions (synergy) and 
is usually integrated into a mixed feeding system (linked 
to the crop system). This enhances complementarity 
between agroecosystems.
Economic diversification
Principle: The economic diversification principle is part 
of the portfolio theory to manage social, economic, and 
environmental risks.
In the Tunisian ALL, small mixed-farming systems, operating 
on less than 10 ha (MARH, 2006), represent 75–85% of the 
agricultural land and these systems produce more than 80% 
of the agricultural products (Marzin et al., 2017). Economic 
diversification is the basis of the resilience and adaptation 
of these small-scale farms to ensure rural livelihood in this 
semi-arid environment where rainfall variability is high and 
permanent (as shown in similar agro-zones of Tunisia, Alary 
et al., 2022a, but also in various contexts, Alary et al, 2019; 
2022b). Economic diversification has been mainly studied 
in terms of the contribution of crop, livestock, and off-farm 
activities to income source diversity, but also in terms of 
assets and net safety.
Gaps
Despite the important and recognized role of economic 
diversification in the resilience and adaptation of rural 
families in the semi-arid areas of Tunisia, this diversification 
is mainly addressed in terms of final outputs and products, 
and often ignored or underestimated is the contribution 
of co- or by-products derived from the crop-tree-livestock 
integration that generate a flux of items that generate indirect 
non-monetary economic value. Moreover, the evaluation of 
this diversification is often done at one time. This approach 
underestimates the total output of this diversification over 
time in a resilience perspective.
Priority innovations
This economic diversification will be addressed through the 
diversification of economic activities (at the farm and off-farm 
level) and their seasonal and annual economic contribution 
to cover the multiple nature of domestic and agricultural 
expenses in the short, medium, and long term. Thus, 
economic diversification is viewed as a means to address the 
adaptive capacity of family farms and their viability.
Co-creation of knowledge
Principle: The co-creation of knowledge principle aims to 
enhance and valorize traditional and scientific knowledge 
at the local level by improving horizontal exchanges (i.e., 
between peers or farmer-to-farmer exchanges). FAO 
(2019) also included the notion of access to agroecological 
knowledge through its transfer. Furthermore, and in 
complement to Wezel (2020) and FAO’s delineation of the 
principles, we can cite the work of Folke et al. (2002) and 
Berkes (2007) that emphasized the human arrangements and 
the co-learning processes that support people living in harsh 
and uncertain environments. 
 “
In the decade of the 
2010s, the co-creation of 
knowledge progressively 
took into consideration 
the local knowledge of 
farms to co-conceive 
adapted innovations.
In the Tunisian ALL, if this principle constitutes a permanent 
concern of the different research and development initiatives 
implemented in Tunisia over the last two decades (see WP 
5 literature review of projects), it has become more and 
more central and strategic in the most recent ones and it 
changed perspectives. In the decade of the 2000s, the co-
creation of knowledge focused on the sharing of knowledge 
by enhancing farmer-to-farm interactions and exchanges, 
notably by organizing farm visits, on-farm demonstrations, 
etc. In the decade of the 2010s, the co-creation of knowledge 
progressively took into consideration the local knowledge 
of farms to co-conceive adapted innovations. In this process, 
participatory approaches and platforms have become a 
key research approach to achieve this objective. At the 
Tunisian ALL sites, we can mention two projects based on this 
November 2023  |  Context Document [Tunisia]  43

approach: the PACTE project, which implements innovations 
based on participatory approaches and platforms (co-
creation), and the CLCA project, which has developed 
knowledge hubs as a final product of the project to ensure 
the scaling out of the cumulated knowledge (transfer) (Frija 
et Idoudi, 2020). This knowledge has become a reference in 
the implementation of the innovation process in the PROSOL 
project.
Gaps
If these last two examples clearly show a keen interest in 
research approaches to enhance the innovation process 
through participation and involvement of stakeholders 
embedding in the co-creation of knowledge principle, the 
lack of financing and/or motivation of staff in government 
agencies or the absence of networks with the private sector 
constitutes a major constraint to facilitating the innovation 
process, thus requiring more involvement and engagement 
from the private and public sector.
Priority innovations
In the Initiative on Agroecology, the co-creation of knowledge 
is mainly supported by the ALL organization and the 
participatory visioning and innovation co-designing that 
allow us to set the priorities and innovations to achieve 
them. In the first step, the six sites that have been selected 
covered a set of agroecological practices that offer an 
opportunity for farmers to enrich each other. Thus, the ALL 
can be considered as a vehicle to facilitate the transmission of 
knowledge from one site to another. Second, the process of 
visioning and innovation co-design allows us to use a mixture 
of traditional and scientific knowledge to co-design the 
innovations. Over time, we propose to monitor the change in 
agronomic practices toward agroecological transformation 
at and between each site to assess the knowledge sharing in 
the Living Landscape, focusing on the knowledge transfer 
and its transformation in the ALL. In each step of the ALL 
establishment, local and regional government agencies are 
associated. One main challenge is to give a concrete place 
and role to the private sector, notably through business 
model development.
Social values and diets
Principle: The social values and diets principle aims at 
developing agroecological transitions with respect to 
cultural values (based on identity and tradition) and 
culinary preferences while providing appropriate healthy 
and diversified diets. FAO (2019) provided insights into 
the mechanisms to decrease vulnerability regarding food 
security.
In the Tunisian ALL, social values and diets have often been 
often approached positively by highlighting Mediterranean 
diets based on olive oil (Thabet et al., 1994). Recent studies 
reveal the dramatic increase in obesity and chronic diseases 
in Tunisia such as overnutrition, which has risen to a higher 
rate (37.2% among women aged 18 years and over), and 
undernutrition (with 8.4% of children under 5 years stunted 
and 2.1% suffering from wasting) (Global Nutrition Report,
November 2023  |  Context Document [Tunisia]  44

2021). Micronutrient deficiencies such as vitamins A and D 
and iron deficiency anemia (Doggui et al, 2021; Salem et al, 
2021) indicate poor-quality diets with possibly low nutrient 
density. Of the nutrition strategy indicators listed for Tunisia, 
no food-based dietary guidelines have been implemented. 
Adult females overall have a higher rate of both underweight 
and overweight (obesity) than their male counterparts (Global 
Nutrition Report, 2021), which indicates gender imbalance in 
nutritional status, with women being more adversely affected 
than their male counterparts. Women farmers’ empowerment 
has been shown to influence the dietary diversity of women 
and their households positively in Tunisia (Kruse, 2019) and 
elsewhere (Sraboni et al., 2014; Malapit and Quisumbing, 
2015). 
Gaps
However, if the role of women in enhancing social values and 
diets is well recognized, and even if improving agricultural 
practices and production can lead to improved nutrition for 
family members whose children are suffering, it is not a piece 
of evidence everywhere and every time (Dury et al., 2015; 
Atta-Krah et al, 2022).
Priority innovations
In this domain, the Initiative on Agroecology in the Tunisian 
ALL proposes to focus on (1) the diversity of diets and diet 
composition building on local food commodities (related 
to vegetables, cereal, animal products, etc.); (2) knowledge 
of the nutritional facts of such food products (source of 
information related to healthy food, the best frequency 
at which to eat meat?, Which foods can negatively affect 
health?); and (3) social and gender equity in terms of 
consumption of such food products (linked to the fairness 
principle). Another axis of research and development will be 
the promotion of traditional products, of which smallholders 
are the main producers and of which niche products with 
high added value are a component, to maintain and develop 
demand. Two co-identified local products that have been 
targeted in the visioning process are carob and honey.
Fairness
Principle: The fairness principle aims at enhancing living 
conditions and equity regarding economic exchanges, 
employment, and even treatment of intellectual property 
rights.
In the Tunisian ALL, the question of fairness or inequity is/has 
been mainly addressed in terms of inequity of access to assets 
and decision-making at the household level (notably between 
men and women) (Najjar et al., 2019) or lack of information 
(Dhehibi et al., 2020), which also extends to access to 
extension services or markets in two governorates of Tunisia 
(Zaghouan and Kairouan) with similar mixed farming systems.
Gaps 
We can observe that few studies address the problems of 
market access according to agroecological or conventional 
agricultural products. Without official recognition of local 
products or low-input products with characteristics similar 
to those of agroecological products, the added-value 
distribution does not allow giving value to the agricultural 
work and knowledge embedded in each product. Moreover, 
some of these local products such as carob are highly 
demanded at the international market with high value.
Priority innovations
In the Tunisian ALL, we propose to look at
1.	 Farm-gate versus market prices of agroecological 
produce, especially for products of “terroir” such as honey 
and dairy products.
2.	 Added-value distribution along the value chains, for 
instance, between farmers and intermediaries.
3.	 Access to valuable market information. 
4.	 Wages/employment for agricultural workers along 
agroecological value chains by gender and age.
Connectivity
Principle: The connectivity principle aims at ensuring 
exchange and confidence between actors. This principle 
highlights the proximity and confidence between producers 
and consumers that should result from short chains or 
organizations.
 “
In the GDA Sers, 
women have created their 
selling point to valorize local 
dairy products (cheese).
In the Tunisian ALL, some local farm organizations (such as 
SMSA or GDA) started to value their local products. We can 
cite the honey or fig hams in the SMSA Kesra. In the GDA Sers, 
women have created their selling point to valorize local dairy 
products (cheese). Some of these activities are supported by 
national or international projects such as CLCA in Sers that 
indirectly seek to improve dairy production through feeding 
management of dairy cattle.
Gaps 
In the Tunisian ALL and more generally in the country, if we 
can note an increasing interest in local products in large urban 
areas such as Tunis, Sousse, or Sfax, the lack of a network or 
knowledge of modern tools (digital tools) to capture demand 
out of their commune constitutes a major break in their 
initiative.  
Priority innovations
In the Initiative on Agroecology, connectivity will be assessed 
both along the agroecological value chains from producers 
to consumers and in the ALL among the multiple actors 
engaged (considering the involvement of women and youth). 
At these two levels, we will consider different factors that 
can influence the degree of connectivity, such as proximity 
and facilities/infrastructure, the nature of the link (exchange 
of goods or services such as information or labor), and the 
frequency and intensity of the links.

Land and natural resource governance
Principle: The land and natural resource governance principle 
focuses on institutional or organizational arrangements 
to sustain and even improve natural resource and land 
management. Natural resources include soil, water, and 
genetic resources. By management, we mean access to 
and use of resources. Governance also means institutional 
arrangements that recognize and support the role and 
responsibilities of all types of farmers, including small family 
farmers.
In the Tunisian ALL, the majority of agricultural land is under 
the statute of private land. For private land, one of the major 
problems is soil degradation, mainly erosion. Thus, many 
projects, such as PROSOL in Tunisia, seek to preserve soil 
with conservation techniques such as the Sulla plantation 
in Rhahla community or agroforestry techniques such as 
those in Kairouan (neighborhood governorate). Forests that 
represent about one-quarter of the area in the two targeted 
governorates are mainly managed by the state. In the forest, 
farmers can have access to and practice picking activities. 
Forest management is mainly piloted by the Direction 
Générale des Forêts, without farmers’ involvement, although 
they are the first users of the biodiversity of these forest 
spaces.
Gaps 
If several research and development projects, mainly in 
partnership with the DG-ACTA, sought to develop soil and 
water conservation techniques to limit and even decrease 
land degradation, the lack of financing over the long term or 
concertation with farmers beyond the targeted farmers or 
associations limits the impact and area of intervention.
Priority innovations 
In the Tunisian ALL, we propose to favor farmers’ involvement 
in soil and water conservation techniques to decrease soil 
erosion and water shortage by working on agronomic 
practices such as cereal-legume associations or plowing 
practices (through minimum tillage) that have already shown 
a positive impact on soil preservation. Working on these 
practices, however, needs to co-conceive their integration 
with the fully integrated system, notably by rational use of 
residues for animals. Another perspective on natural resource 
governance will be to work on residue management at the 
territorial level to favor compost activities for soil fertility 
management.
Participation 
Principle: The participation principle is based on the 
involvement and inclusiveness of all farmers in social 
organization and decision-making processes in food 
systems. This participation also means institutional 
arrangements that recognize and support the role and 
responsibilities of all types of farmers, including small family 
farmers.
In the Tunisian ALL, the main organizational structures that 
compose the ALL are farm organizations such as GDA and 
SMSA. These organizational structures are considered 
the main actionable network to support a stakeholders’ 
platform with the public and private sector (see Frija et 
Idoudi, 2020).
Gaps 
These organizations, however, suffer from a lack 
of knowledge or a network to be the motor of their 
development. In the majority of cases, they are receptors of 
national and international support with few initiatives on their 
own.
Priority innovations
Participation through the Initiative on Agroecology will be 
addressed at the farm and FO levels through the effective 
participation of individuals in the ALL (according to sex and 
age) in the decision-making processes from the co-design to 
the implementation of agroecological principles.

Next steps
This contextualization document is considered as a 
preliminary document that covers the different dimensions 
and domains of agroecology, but also identifies the gaps 
in terms of knowledge that need to be considered in the 
agroecological transitions co-built with actors engaged 
in the Tunisian Living Landscape. The description of each 
agroecological principle and its potential content in the 
Tunisian ALL also constituted a basis of knowledge for 
co-designing the technical and organizational innovation 
packages that will be implemented with stakeholders.

organizations (GDA, SMSA) in the 
Tunisian ALLs
Team report: Udo Rudiger, Asmaa Soussi, 
Véronique Alary, Hassen Ouerghemmi 
(ICARDA)
As proposed in the “Guidelines and suggestions for 
stakeholder mapping and existing initiative assessment 
as part of WP 1,” based on draft 23/08 proposed by 
Bernard Triomphe and Nadia Bergamini, we have used and 
adapted “Appendix 2: Fiche for organizing the basics of an 
organization” to collect the first data on the Tunisian ALL. The 
guideline of this diagnostic proposes four sections:
1.	 Describe the key characteristics of each STH or initiative 
(Who? How are they organized? Composition?), their main 
activities, and their area of influence.
2.	 Explore the diversity of the key partners. This information 
will contribute to the STH mapping.
3.	 Discuss the main issues/challenges and their propositions 
to see how the agroecological approach could meet their 
needs.
4.	 Describe the main farm activities that will be used as the 
main basic elements of the description of agriculture 
today in the Visioning.

Procedures to recruit a woman for store management is in progress.
The annual subscription fee of members is TND 20 per year. The GDA funds managed annually do not 
exceed TND 800 or 900. However, GDA supporters can beneﬁt from several credits reaching TND 5,000 
dinars through NGOs such as the Tunisian Union of Social Solidarity (UTSS) and micro-credit associations 
such as Enda and Syres. Other associations such as Seine- maritime and the organizations GIZ, AISSA, and 
ICARDA provide some equipment (e.g., cheese processing, small-scale mechanization, mobile phones) 
and training (10% of sales contribute to GDA functioning).
Decisions are made during meetings with supporters. 
No
There are no reports, just some ﬁnancial records and personal notes taken by the president.
One of the controllers mentioned the need to have more knowledge of conﬂict management.

Annex 2. Review of soil health 
indicators in the El Kef-Siliana transect
Project team: Haithem Bahri, Isaf Mekki, Wael 
Toukabri, Mereiem Barbouchi, Mohamed 
Annabi, Hatem Cheikh M’Hamed), Review 
report, December 2022 
Overview
Soils constitute a major reservoir of global biodiversity. 
Living soil organisms play an important role in processes 
such as decomposition, nitrogen fixation, and the regulation 
of greenhouse gas emissions. Soils are also a large store of 
carbon, contributing to climate change mitigation (FAO, 
2020). Carbon sequestration in agricultural soils also 
contributes to improved soil quality, agricultural productivity, 
biodiversity, and water conservation, and thus greater 
resilience to climate change (Ghimire et al., 2022).
The soil is a complex and dynamic system. It represents a 
precious resource that needs to be protected to ensure 
agricultural ecosystem sustainability. Soil health includes 
physical, biological, and chemical aspects. In terms of 
physical aspects, healthy soils are free of compaction, 
erosion, clogging, and crusting. Regarding biological and 
chemical aspects, healthy soils exhibit balanced nutrients and 
are not polluted by toxic substances. Healthy soils also host a 
diversity of living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, other 
microorganisms, invertebrates, and some vertebrate animals. 
Healthy soils continuously provide ecosystem services, such 
as food and biomass production, including in agriculture 
and forestry; water absorption, storage, and filtering; and 
transformation of nutrients and substances, thus protecting 
groundwater (Toor et al., 2021). 
Healthy soil functions as part of an ecosystem, supports 
crop productivity, maintains environmental quality, and 
promotes plant and animal health. The Global Soil Health 
(GSH) assessment characterizes soils by indicators related 
to physical, biological, and chemical components (Figure 
A2-1) (Moebius-Clune et al., 2016). These indicators allow 
the measurement of one or more soil properties essential 
to the healthy functioning of the soil, which are sensitive 
to changes in soil processes and reflect the relationships 
between biological, chemical, and physical properties. 
Indicators, calculated values, and estimated statistics relative 
to a threshold level are being increasingly used across 
biological, environmental, economic, social, institutional, 
and political disciplines to assess current conditions or 
trends of soil health. Currently, soil health monitoring relies 
on soil health indicators. These indicators can be used as an 
indirect measure of soil function, serving to assess soil quality 
or health and its direction of change with time, by linking 
functional relationships among measurable attributes and 
monitoring for sustainable land management, including 
environmental impacts. According to the National Resource 
Conservation Service (NRCS), “indicators are measurable 
properties of soil or plants that provide clues about how well 
the soil can function.”
Indicators need to be easy to measure through either 
qualitative or quantitative techniques. Once the indicators are 
gathered, you can evaluate patterns and compare results to 
neighboring fields or prior years to gauge how soil quality has 
changed.

Soil physical indicators
Soil physical properties provide information related to water 
and air movement through the soil as well as conditions 
affecting germination, root growth, and erosion processes. 
Many soil physical properties thus form the foundation of 
other chemical and biological processes, which might be 
further governed by climate, landscape position, and land 
use. A range of soil physical properties are highlighted 
as potential soil health indicators, and key soil physical 
indicators in relation to climate change include soil structure, 
water infiltration, bulk density, rooting depth, and soil surface 
cover, which are discussed below.
Soil structure (aggregate stability, porosity)
Soil aggregates are soil particles bound together. Stability 
refers to the ability of the soil aggregates to maintain their 
form despite disturbances caused by tilling, water, or wind. 
Changes in soil aggregate stability are indicators of improved 
soil health, organic matter content, biological activity, and 
nutrient cycling. 
This is considered a useful soil health indicator since it is 
involved in maintaining important ecosystem functions in 
soil, including organic carbon (C) accumulation, infiltration 
capacity, movement and storage of water, and root and 
microbial community activity. It can also be used to measure 
soil resistance to erosion and management changes. Because 
of its association with the storage of soil organic carbon (SOC) 
and water, its measurement can be useful to guide climate 
adaptation strategies, especially in areas that are likely 
to experience high and intense rainfall and consequently 
increased erosion events. Since aggregate stability is 
measured in many different ways, standardized procedures 
are required within a soil health monitoring framework under 
climate change scenarios.
Porosity, a measure of the void spaces in a material as a 
fraction (volume of voids to that of the total volume), and pore 
size distribution provide a direct quantitative estimate of the 
ability of a soil to store root-zone water and air necessary for 
plant growth. Pore characteristics are strongly linked to soil 
physical quality. Bulk density and microporosity are functions 
of pore volume, while soil porosity and water release 
characteristics directly influence a range of soil physical 
indices, including soil aeration capacity, plant available water 
capacity, and relative field capacity. Since root development 
and soil enzyme activities are closely related to soil porosity 
and pore size distribution and because future climate change 
scenarios (e.g., elevated CO2 and temperature, and variable 
and extreme rainfall events) might alter root development 
and soil biological activities, soil porosity and pore size 
distribution and consequently soil functions are likely to be 
affected in unexpected directions. 
Available water capacity
Water capacity is the maximum amount of water stored in 
the soil for the plant. It’s crucial to plant health when water is 
needed by the plant between irrigations or rainstorms. 
Much of this depends on innate soil texture but it can be 
affected by the amount of soil organic matter and soil 
aggregation, both of which can increase water holding 
capacity.
Bulk density
Bulk density is an indicator of soil compaction. When soils are 
too compact, this might restrict root growth, which ultimately 
affects plant growth and crop yield. Additional dangers are 
increased runoff, erosion, and waterlogged soils. 
It is considered as a useful indicator for assessing soil health 
with respect to soil functions such as aeration and infiltration. 
Since bulk density is in general negatively correlated with 
soil organic matter or SOC content, the loss of organic C from 
increased decomposition due to elevated temperatures 
might lead to an increase in bulk density and hence make soil 
more prone to compaction via land management activities 
and climate change stresses, for example, from variable and 
high-intensity rainfall and drought events.

function.

Rooting depth
Rooting depth is considered an important indicator of soil 
health, since changes in this property are likely to affect plant 
available water capacity, subsoil salinity, SOC content, or 
other properties to indicate physicochemical constraints 
in the soil profile. Under prolonged drought, the impact 
of subsoil constraints such as salinity and high chloride 
concentrations is likely to be greater on plant available 
water and hence plant productivity. Also, Birkas et al. 
(2008) included rooting depth as a soil health parameter for 
monitoring of soil condition and plant growth under extreme 
drought and variable rainfall events to indicate the potential 
for adaptability to and mitigation of climate stresses through 
alteration of rooting depth.
Soil surface cover
Soil surface cover provides a range of important ecological 
functions, including protection of the soil surface by 
dissipating raindrop impact energy, soil stabilization, 
reduction in erodible surface area, water and nutrient 
retention, C fixation, and, in some instances, N fixation and 
support of native seed germination. 
Soil structural conditions such as soil crust and soil seal 
formation, primarily related to sodicity, are also indicators 
that could be used to characterize soil health under climate 
change. The formation of soil crusts and seals can affect a 
range of soil processes, such as water infiltration, oxygen 
diffusion, runoff, surface water evaporation, and wind 
erosion. A range of methods exist to measure their thickness 
and strength, although research effort is needed to relate 
these properties to soil processes affecting ecosystem 
functions and plant productivity, as well as to evaluate their 
role in mitigating adverse climate change impacts, thereby 
assisting in climate change adaptation.
Soil chemical indicators
Chemical indicators can provide a perspective on the 
following functions: promoting biodiversity; filtering, 
buffering, degrading, and detoxifying organic and inorganic 
materials; controlling water and solute flow; cycling carbon 
and nutrients; and physical foundation for plants, animals, 
and humans. 
pH
Soil pH, a function of parent material, time of weathering, 
vegetation, and climate, is considered as one of the dominant 
chemical indicators of soil health, identifying trends in 
change for a range of soil biological and chemical functions, 
including acidification, salinization, crop performance, 
nutrient availability and cycling, and biological activity. Soil 
pH has thus been included in integrative soil health tests 
to assess the effects of land-use changes and agricultural 
practices.
Electrical conductivity
Soil electrical conductivity (EC), a measure of salt 
concentration, is considered an easily measured, reliable 
indicator of soil health. It can inform trends in salinity, crop 
performance, nutrient cycling (particularly nitrate), and 
biological activity, and, along with pH, can act as a surrogate 
measure of soil structural decline, especially in sodic 
soils. Electrical conductivity has been used as a chemical 
indicator to inform soil biological quality in response to 
crop management practices. Clearly, there is a need for 
comprehensive assessment of the influence of drivers of 
climate change on soil EC as an important soil health indicator 
in different ecosystems.
Soil nutrient availabilities
Measurement of extractable nutrients can provide an 
indication of a soil’s capacity to support plant growth; 
conversely, it can identify critical or threshold values 
for environmental hazard assessment. Nutrient cycling, 
especially N, is intimately linked to soil organic C cycling. 
Drivers of climate change such as elevated temperatures, 
variable precipitation, and atmospheric N deposition are thus 
likely to affect N cycling and possibly the cycling of other plant 
available nutrients such as phosphorus and sulfur, although 
the direction and exact magnitude of change in plant 
available nutrients need to be investigated in detail.
Soil biological indicators
The soil is teeming with billions of soil organisms. Some 
of these organisms are observable with the naked eye 
(earthworms, millipedes, spiders, mites, reptiles, and 
mammals), others are microscopic (archaea, bacteria, fungi, 
nematodes, and protozoa). 
These organisms play a key role in functions related to crop 
and plant health, including nutrient cycling, making nutrients 
available to the plant, nurturing soil structure, degrading soil 
pollutants, and breaking down organic matter. 
Soil organic matter
The main indicators for evaluating SOM status include SOC, 
since it comprises about 50% of SOM; organic N, since it is 
closely associated with organic C and is the most important 
nutrient for plant productivity; and readily mineralizable C 
and N. As SOM drives the majority of soil functions, decreases 
in SOM can lead to a decrease in fertility and biodiversity as 
well as a loss of soil structure, resulting in decreased water 
holding capacity, increased risk of erosion and increased 
bulk density, and hence soil compaction. Land-use and 
management practices that lead to a buildup of SOM will 
help in absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, thus mitigating 
global warming. By increasing water storage, SOM can play 
an important role in mitigating flooding impacts following 
extreme rainfall events, while storing water in the event of 
droughts and thus increasing soil resilience.

Soil microbiome 
Soil microbes are involved in actually making soil work. Soil 
microbes break down organic matter, cycle all nutrients, 
build soil structure, build soil organic matter, increase water 
holding capacity, suppress disease, and more. All of these 
affect important crop measurements such as crop yield and 
resilience when faced with environmental stress.
Soil enzymes
Soil enzymes play a role in the decomposition and release 
of plant-available nutrients. They are derived from living 
and dead microbes (archaea, bacteria, fungi, nematodes, 
and protozoa), plant roots and residues, and soil organisms 
(nematodes, millipedes, insects, mites, spiders, reptiles).
Interpreting soil health indicator values and 
determining soil health score
When soil health indicators are combined into different 
scoring systems, often using complicated formulas to 
generate weighted values, they can be used to ultimately 
produce an index for assessment. This soil health assessment 
aims to enhance end-user knowledge to improve effective 
soil management. Thus, an aggregated representation of 
assessment results of different soil parameters, or a soil 
health index, is desirable. However, choosing indicators is a 
daunting task since it is difficult to determine which indicators 
and threshold values of those indicators would be the best 
representation of a particular soil type or best way to assess 
the effectiveness of management practices to improve 
soil health. The rule of the thumb is to select indicators 
depending on soil management and specific soil functions 
that need attention for a particular soil type (Hubanks et al., 
2018). Although it might be exciting to use a comprehensive 
list of soil health indicators to build an index, that is expensive 
and impractical. Many studies have indicated that selecting 
a few indicators is much more effective in detecting 
management impacts on soil quality (Andrews et al., 2002; 
Hubanks et al., 2018; Lima et al., 2013). Thus, a minimum set of 
easy indicators is more appropriate for use in assessment and 
to construct a soil health index that will be easy to interpret 
and use.
Field practices to improve soil health
Sustainable agriculture is underpinned by preserving 
and protecting two natural resources: soil and water. This 
implies that improving soil health is achieved by using field 
practices that enhance physical, chemical, and biological 
properties. Soil health field practices are based on four basic 
soil principles: (1) minimize soil disturbance, (2) keep soil 
covered, (3) maximize the period of living root growth, and 
(4) maximize plant biodiversity (USDA-NRCS, 2018). Building 
soil organic matter is increasingly recognized and viewed as 
the key principle of soil health improvement strategies. These 
four soil health principles essentially guide the broader 
framework for all soil health management practices.

Principle 1: Minimize soil disturbance. Soil disturbance can 
be physical, chemical, or biological. Physical soil disturbance 
is caused by conventional tillage systems involving primary 
operations such as soil loosening, weed removal, and 
incorporating fertilizer and amendments, and secondary 
operations such as seedbed preparation before planting 
crops. Chemical disturbance includes fertilizer and pesticide 
applications (USDA-NRCS, 2018).
Biological disturbance involves overgrazing animals and 
monocultures, which can lead to compaction and biological 
imbalance, decreased root mass, and increased runoff 
(Larkin, 2015).
Principle 2: Keep soil covered. When either living plants or 
plant residues protect soils, there is a significant decrease in 
erosion and increases in microbial activity, organic matter, 
and soil fertility. Cover crops keep the soil covered during 
periods of time (i.e., winter) when cash crops are not growing. 
Thus, cover crops protect the soil, decrease erosion, and 
enhance organic matter due to biomass addition. Other 
benefits of using cover crops are increased water infiltration, 
decreased nutrient loss, increased number of mycorrhizae, 
and weed, pest, and disease control (Sarrantonio and 
Gallandt, 2003). Cover crop residue also minimizes the 
impact of raindrops on the soil surface and serves as a habitat 
and food source for soil microbes. Cover crops also add 
carbon into the soil and help tie up nutrients, especially by 
scavenging nitrogen from the soil during winter (Hubbard 
et al., 2013). Cover crops can prevent some nutrient loss and 
recycle nitrogen, eventually releasing the nitrogen from the 
residue as soil organisms begin the decomposition process.
Principle 3: Maximize the period of living root growth. 
Keeping living roots with cover crops and perennial crops 
helps sustain the microbial population in the soil. When plants 
are alive, they produce sugars through photosynthesis, which 
are then released and lost in the soil through the roots. Live 
roots in the soil provide those exudates to the microbes to 
stimulate more activity, which leads to faster decomposition 
and contributes to nutrient cycling in soils. Thus, growing 
plants throughout the year, such as long-season crops, crop 
rotations, and cover crops, can provide multiple benefits for 
soil health.
Principle 4: Maximize plant diversity. The diversity of 
plant species and plant-soil-microorganism interactions 
promotes soil biodiversity. Healthy soil requires active 
decomposition, nutrient cycling, and soil functions, which 
can be accomplished with crop rotations, cover crops, and 
organic matter amendments. Diverse crop rotations offer 
plant diversity, which helps break up soil-borne pest and 
disease life cycles, improve crop health, manage weeds, 
decrease nutrient losses from soils, and improve soil health 
(Larkin, 2015). Diverse plants in time and space in cropping 
systems release sugars, which support diverse food webs and 
energy chains essential for cropping systems and microbial 
activity in soils.
Current research findings related to soil health 
indicators in Siliana and Kef governorates.
Several studies were conducted to assess soil health in Siliana 
and Kef regions using different soil indicators (physical, 
chemical, and biological). 
Soil texture was investigated in the study of Moussaoui et 
al. (2010) as a physical indicator to evaluate the impact of 
land degradation by erosion in the Siliana region. In the 
same study, chemical indicators, including mineral nitrogen 
content, phosphorus, potassium, and soil pH, as well as 
organic matter content as a biological indicator were also 
used to assess the soil fertility of Siliana affected by erosion.
Masghouni (2018) studied the effect of vegetation cover on 
soil properties in the Siliana region. In this work, physical, 
chemical, and biological indicators were chosen. The physical 
indicators were water retention and structural stability. 
Chemical indicators were OM content, total nitrogen, 
phosphorus, and exchangeable potassium. For biological 
indicators, microbial respiration, microbial and fungal 
biomass, denitrifying activity, and the number of earthworms 
were considered. The results of this work showed that soil 
under plant cover positively affects physical, chemical, and 
biological indicators.

The results 
of this work showed 
that soil under plant 
cover positively affects 
physical, chemical, and 
biological indicators.
Other work has studied the effect of minimum tillage or 
reduced tillage on physical, chemical, and biological 
indicators in the Kef and Siliana regions (Boudabbous, 
2009; Jemai et al., 2012; Jemai et al., 2013). The results of 
this work showed that the indicators N, P, K, OM content, 
and structural stability are affected by cultural practices. In 
fact, under a reduced tillage system, residue decomposes 
more slowly. One reason is that fewer aggregates are broken 
with less intensive tillage, so less organic matter is exposed 
to decomposition. A second reason is that reduced tillage 
can make soil temperatures slightly cooler, which helps 
to preserve more organic matter because the residue is 
not rapidly decomposed. Moreover, reduced tillage does 
not disrupt earthworm burrowing and helps protect the 
network created by mycorrhizal fungi that connects them 
to their host plant. Leaving residue on the soil surface also 
acts as a barrier against raindrops and wind that could cause 
erosion. Overall, these studies suggest that soil health can 
November 2023  |  Context Document [Tunisia]  69

be improved by decreasing tillage intensity, planting cover 
crops, and keeping crop residue, and that biological soil 
health indicators associated with labile carbon and nitrogen 
are most affected by management practices such as tillage 
intensity. Therefore, soil health indicators are sensitive to 
agronomic management systems.
Also, aggregate stability and organic matter are used as 
physical and biological indicators to study the effect of land-
use systems in the northwest region (Bouajila and Gallali, 
2010). Results showed that the most stable samples were 
derived from a carbonated horizon. In carbonated soils, in 
addition to organic matter and clay, CaCO3 was considered 
an important agent of aggregation. In contrast, where soils 
were characterized by sandy texture and a low amount of 
CaCO3, organic matter was the principal agent of aggregate 
stability. Therefore, soil aggregate stability and soil organic 
carbon fraction could be used as indicators for applying the 
most appropriate management practices to increase soil 
sustainability.
Allani et al. (2022) studied the distribution of nitrogen and 
phosphorus in agricultural soils in the Siliana region in order 
to optimize fertilizer application. In fact, soil microbiota 
is extremely sensitive to nutrient doses. With optimum 
nutrients, plants grow quickly and better withstand pest 
damage, and soil microbes and soil fauna thrive optimally 
for maintaining necessary soil functions. Results showed 
that variation in the content of essential elements such 
as nitrogen and phosphorus and in the physicochemical 
parameters of the soil is significantly related to the seasonal 
contrast and to the depth of the soil horizon (Allani et al., 
2022). Laterally, the variation is slight, and it seems to be 
related to the homogenization of the studied soil. This is 
related to the dynamics of nitrogen and phosphorus in 
vertebrate agricultural soil. Thus, it is time to properly manage 
agricultural practices and the rates with which fertilizer is 
added to the soil. The factors that influence the dynamics of 
nitrogen and phosphorus at this study site are essentially the 
physicochemical properties of the soil, such as texture, clay 
content, structure, and soil nature.
In the Kef region, Rezgui et al. (2014) studied the effect of 
tillage and crop type on physical soil properties such as bulk 
density, structural stability, soil moisture, and porosity. Results 
of this study indicate that, for the two types of crops, no-tillage 
increased the bulk density, structural stability, and moisture 
of the soil by 5%, 75%, and 19%, respectively. On the other 
hand, sowing with reverse sowing increased the total porosity 
by 10%, an increase of 29% compared to direct sowing. 
Indeed, no-tillage enriches the soil with organic matter and 
therefore improves structural stability. It makes it possible to 
increase the proportion of medium pores (from 0.2 to 50.0 
µm) in the surface layers of the soil (<20 cm) to the detriment 
of macropores, without increasing total porosity. The effect 
of tillage mode on physical characteristics differs with soil 
depth. At the surface (0–15 cm), no-tillage increased the bulk 
density and soil moisture. This technique limits the impact of 
precipitation on the physical state of the soil. From 15 to 30 cm, 
the structural stability was maximal. This rhizosphere is usually 
richer in organic colloids produced by microorganisms. 
These substances help cement the soil particles together. At 
depth, conventional plowing with reverse plowing increased 
bulk density and decreased porosity. Unsuitable cultivation 
practices promote consolidation of the 30–40-cm horizon 
that has not been worked, which constitutes a real constraint 
to the hydrodynamic functioning of the soil and to root 
development. This layer has undergone a cumulative effect 
of the passage of machines and has remained unchanged 
with its massive structure constituting a real obstacle to any 
vertical evolution. In addition to tillage, it appears that organic 
matter on the soil surface caused an amplification of biological 
activity that increased porosity. The cultivated species 
significantly affected the physical and water parameters of the 
soil. The highest values of bulk density and structural stability 
were observed at the level of faba bean conducted with no-
tillage. This species benefited more from the effect of straw 
residues left by the previous durum wheat crop.
In these two regions, Siliana and Kef, Erouissi et al. (2011) were 
interested in biological indicators such as soil invertebrates 
to compare conventional and no-tillage management. No-till 
(NT) systems have less mechanical mixing of crop residues 
with soil minerals than conventional-till (CT) systems. Thus, NT 
systems are likely undisturbed ecosystems and might depend 
more on soil organisms for proper functioning. The results 
showed that NT enhanced soil fauna populations either in 
diversity or in abundance in the two regions (Figure A2-2), 
which confirms the negative effect of CT on richness and 
diversity of the soil fauna community in relation to NT systems. 
The negative impact of CT on ecosystem engineers and 
functional guilds (arthropods and earthworms) was also clear 
in this study. The move from CT to NT improved soil biological 
components, which could be explained by two factors: the 
change in soil properties and the decreased number of 
machine passes over the field; thus, a lack of disturbance.

When residues are left on the soil surface, the ecosystem 
engineers (worms and other organisms) and litter 
transformers can become much more important than in 
disturbed ecosystems (residues incorporated). Ben Moussa-
Machraoui et al. (2010) showed that, under semi-arid 
conditions in northwestern Tunisia (Kef, Siliana), NT improved 
soil properties when compared with CT. NT significantly, 
improved soil content, especially for K, K2O, P2O5, and N. The 
same authors indicated that clay and silt soils can be affected 
over a short time by tillage management. Soil organic matter 
showed higher values under NT, but the results were not 
significantly different from those of CT. However, under NT 
agroecosystems, earthworms and microarthropods played a 
dominant role in organic matter decay, and therefore nutrient 
flux patterns. Moreover, the soil fauna of natural ecosystems 
influences organic matter decay and mineralization 
processes, bringing about a better availability of nutrients in 
the soil.
Ben Moussa-Machraoui et al. (2010) also found that cation 
exchange capacity (CEC) is a good indicator of the degree 
of mineral fertility of soil. It depends on the soil texture as 
well as the amount of SOM (Figure A2-3). In their findings, the 
CEC values were slightly higher in NT than in CT. Also, the N 
content for both sites was significantly greater under NT than 
under CT. Soil and crop management practices might alter 
the quantity, quality, and placement of plant residues that 
influence soil C and N fractions.
Dridi and Guedari (2019) studied the dynamics of nitrogen 
mineralization as an indicator of plant growth in the Kef region 
in order to classify the soils according to their potentially 
mineralizable nitrogen and kinetics and to identify the effect 
of other soil properties on nitrogen content. The results 
showed that nitrogen content decreased with depth following 
different patterns depending on the soil type. The highest 
content of inorganic nitrogen was recorded in a Calcisol 
because of high organic carbon and nitrogen amounts and 
low C:N ratio throughout the profile. The lowest content was 
recorded in a Luvisol because of its large clay-silt fraction 
and low pH, especially at depth. The vertical distribution of 
ammonium and nitrate contents showed marked monthly 
variations. The laboratory results presented the following 
decreasing order of potentially mineralizable nitrogen 
and kinetics: Calcisol > Vertisol > Cambisol > Luvisol, 
and revealed two fractions constituting organic nitrogen 
supplies: an active fraction with a rapid mineralization and 
a passive fraction slowed down by clays and resistant to 
biodegradation.
Conclusions 
The majority of soil health indicators were addressed 
in the Kef and Siliana regions by physical indicators 
such as texture, structure, bulk density, porosity, and 
soil moisture; chemical indicators such as soil organic 
matter content, CEC, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, 
and CaCO3 content; and biological indicators such as 
microbial biomass and microbial biomass activity, but 
all these indicators have been used by researchers for 
specific purposes and do not reflect the knowledge 
of farmers. It is therefore imperative to study farmers’ 
perceptions of the indicators of their soil health.

1. Introduction: The agricultural question and the political economy 
of food security in Tunisia  
Located in a semi-arid geographical area, Tunisia has managed to control the evolution of 
its demography and implemented various public policies (agricultural, social, health, 
commercial, environmental, training, and research, etc.) that have allowed it to have 
relatively satisfactory economic and social results in comparison with other Arab or 
African countries. 
Considered until 2008 to be the good pupil of the World Bank, Tunisia experienced three 
major crises. The first took place in the late 1960s with the poorly planned introduction 
of the cooperative system. Rejected by the majority of the nascent private sector actors 
and by the populations still attached to their recently nationalized lands, this policy led to 
a serious crisis in the national agricultural sector and was quickly abandoned.  
The failure of this dirigiste phase of collectivization and agrarian restructuring has led to 
a pauperization of the agricultural world and a massive rural exodus. This phase 
continues to haunt the collective imagination of Tunisians and to discourage the search 
for new models of agricultural development. For Ghali and Mohnen (2004): “The problem 
was that the cooperative movement was imposed by government instead of developing 
out of a change in mentality and in the interest of its members. The production 
cooperatives, created by the Law of May 27 1963, embraced land formerly owned by 
colonialists and now by government and privately owned neighboring pieces of land. 
They were neither true cooperatives nor public enterprises. They absorbed large amounts 
of public money without increasing the productivity of the fertile land »2. 
The second major crises, in the mid-1980s, accompanied the uncertainties of the end of 
the reign of the leader Habib Bourguiba. This crisis led to the riots of 1983, which followed 
the lifting of subsidies and the sudden increase in the price of bread.  This second crisis 
led, in 1986, to the implementation of a structural adjustment plan in line with the 
recommendations of the IMF and accelerated the end of the regime of the leader 
Bourguiba (in 1987). Elloumi (2006) points out that "For the agricultural sector, the 
implementation of the Structural Adjustment Program and its agricultural component 
will result in two fundamental elements: the dismantling of the boards and the 
implementation of a pricing policy that eliminates input subsidies and gives a greater role 
to the market. The program also includes a policy of disengagement of the State and a 
profound change in the policy of supervising producers with an increased role for 
professional and peasant organizations."3 
The "new era" led by General Ben Ali took advantage of the reforms introduced at the end 
of the 1980s. It allowed an economic rebound with the signing of an association treaty

3 Elloumi, M., (2006), L'AGRICULTURE TUNISIENNE DANS UN CONTEXTE DE LIBÉRALISATION, Région et 
Développement n° 23-2006. Elloumi also notes, "The other aspect of structural adjustment policy concerns the 
dismantling of the structures for supervising agricultural producers. Thus, the Office of the Sidi Bouzid region was 
abolished in 1989 and its prerogatives were taken over by the CRDA. However, this transition has resulted in a 
loss of management flexibility and proximity to farmers, particularly with regard to perimeters irrigated."

with the European Union in 1995 and, in 1998, the establishment of a free trade area with 
Europe. In 1987, Tunisia signed a structural adjustment plan with an agricultural 
component. The objective was to liberalize prices, reduce government intervention, 
liberalize international trade, improve market infrastructure and trade standards and 
establish the basis for a market economy4. 
The last major crisis in independent Tunisia began around 2005, following the exhaustion 
of the neo-liberal model that combined economic "openness" with political "closure" and 
authoritarianism. In the absence of equitable sharing of wealth, and with the rise in power 
of corruption linked to the Ben Ali family, Tunisia has been caught in the "trap of 
intermediate economies". This quickly led to the revolt of 2011. Just before he left, Ben Ali 
promised to reduce the price of staples (sugar, milk, and bread), but it was too late to save 
his regime. While raising high hopes, the end of the dictatorship has only exacerbated the 
economic and social crisis and poses major challenges to the country's food and 
nutritional security. 
Today, Tunisia's agricultural sector accounts for 8% of the country's GDP and plays a 
fundamental role in the country's social, regional and environmental balance. While 
Tunisia was able to achieve food self-sufficiency on a number of products (milk and 
derivatives, red and white meat, vegetables, etc.), the agriculture remains fragile and too 
dependent on food imports and on climatic hazards.  
This work will begin with a quick diagnosis of the situation of the right to food and food 
security in Tunisia. We will discuss the incorporation of the food and nutrition issue in 
Tunisian legislation and, from a comparative perspective; we will present the rankings of 
Tunisia on this issue. In the second phase, we will discuss the main challenges that we 
believe must be met in order to improve sovereignty and food and nutritional security in 
Tunisia. The fourth section will focus on governance and the roles of civil society, social 
movements and popular groups in building this sovereignty. Finally, we will present some 
recommendations likely to improve Tunisia's food and nutritional security and promote 
its food sovereignty.   
2. Elements of a global diagnosis of the situation of the right to food 
and food security in Tunisia 
2.1 The right to food, security, and sovereignty: legal and institutional framework 
a- The right to food in the Tunisian constitution 
The second constitution of the Republic of Tunisia (2014) contains no direct and explicit 
reference to right to food, food sovereignty or security. However, it does include several 
articles indirectly related to these issues. Thus, Article 12 gives the State the objective of 
"achieving social justice, sustainable development, regional balance and rational 
exploitation of national wealth with reference to development indicators and based on 
the principle of positive discrimination". It also provides that the State shall work for the 
"proper exploitation of national wealth". Article 13 provides that "Natural resources are

the property of the Tunisian people; the sovereignty of the State over these resources is 
exercised in its name. The exploitation contracts relating to its resources are submitted 
to the specialized commission within the assembly of people's representatives. 
Conventions ratified in respect to these resources are submitted to the assembly for 
approval. ». With regard to water, article 40 of the Constitution stipulates that the right to 
water is guaranteed and that its preservation and rational use are a duty for the State and 
society. This constitution also obliges the state to guarantee "the right to a healthy and 
balanced environment and participation in climate security. The State must provide the 
necessary means to eliminate environmental pollution" (Article 45). Finally, the fourth 
section of the constitution provides for the establishment of a high authority for 
sustainable development and the rights of future generations. This authority would be 
obligatorily consulted for draft laws relating to trade, social and environmental issues as 
well as for development plans (Article 129). For the time being, this body has still not been 
set up. 
b- The right to food in international conventions concerning Tunisia 
Adopted on 16 December 1966 by the United Nations General Assembly, Tunisia ratified 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) on 18 March 
1969. Article 11(2) of the Covenant provides for the right to be free from hunger and food 
security5. 
As a member of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Tunisia is also a signatory of the 
"Declaration of Human Rights in Islam" adopted in Cairo on 5 August 1990. Article 17 of 
the Declaration provides that "The State shall guarantee the right of everyone to a life of 
dignity, which shall ensure his or her needs and those for which he or she is responsible. 
These needs include food, clothing, shelter, education, medical care, and all basic needs. 
However, even though Tunisia is a member of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, 
it has not yet signed the Statute of the Islamic Food Security Organization, established in 
2013. 
Similarly, although Tunisia belongs to the League of Arab States, it has still not ratified its 
charter of human rights. Article 38 of the Arab Charter on Human Rights (2004) states 
that "Everyone has the right to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, 
which ensures their well-being and a decent life, including food, clothing, housing and 
services, and to a healthy environment. States Parties shall take the necessary measures 
within their resources to ensure this right. ». Article 39 of the Charter states that States 
parties recognize the right of every member of society to enjoy the guarantee of "basic 
food and drinking water".  
                                                             
5 « 2. The States Parties to the present Covenant, recognizing the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger, 
shall adopt, individually and through international co-operation, the necessary measures, including concrete programs:  
(a) To improve methods of food production, conservation and distribution through the full utilization of technical and 
scientific knowledge, through the dissemination of principles of nutritional education and through the development or 
reform of agrarian systems, so as to ensure the optimum development and utilization of natural resources;  
(b) To ensure an equitable distribution of world food resources in relation to needs, taking into account the problems 
faced by both food-importing and food-exporting countries. » 

7 
 
Finally, the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (adopted in 1981) ratified by 
Tunisia on 16 March 1983, provides in article 29 that the individual has the duty "to 
preserve the harmonious development of the family and to work for the cohesion and 
respect of this family; to respect at all times his parents, to feed them, and to assist them 
if necessary". It remains silent on other aspects that could be directly related to 
agricultural activities or food and nutritional security.  
2.2 Main global characteristics of the Tunisian agricultural sector 
Still considered strategic for the country's stability, Tunisia's agricultural sector has seen 
a relative decline in its contribution to GDP, from 19.6% in 1962 to 8.1% in 2016.  
Analysis of the data available since the 1960s shows two main strengths of this sector: 
- The Tunisian agricultural sector has been able to recover its production lag compared to 
the world average; 
- Tunisia's agricultural sector is resilient and acts as a buffer against shocks that 
destabilize the Tunisian economy. 
a- An agricultural sector that has caught up. 
The following diagram shows that over the last fifty years, Tunisian agricultural food 
production has clearly improved and that it has reached the world average: 
 
Figure 1: Food production index6 (2004 to 2006=100) 
 
Source: World Bank 
However, this index also shows that Tunisia has been overtaken by comparable countries 
and especially that there are large interannual fluctuations that are sources of 
uncertainty, discourage investment, and risk-taking. Moreover, this increase in 
agricultural production is more related to the increased mobilization of natural resources 
(soil and water) than to the improvement of productivity7. Overall, productivity in the 
agricultural sector remains low relative to its potential. The products the most 
                                                             
6 The food production index refers to food crops that are considered edible and contain nutrients. Coffee and tea are 
excluded because although they are edible they have no nutritional value.

competitive, namely fruit and vegetables (including olive oil), durum wheat and fishing 
represents 58% of production over the last 20 years and has contributed to the growth of 
the sector only by 46%, while non-competitive products (common wheat, meat, and milk) 
and which account for 39% of production contributed only about 52% growth in the 
sector8. 
b- A resilient agricultural sector 
This resilience of the Tunisian agricultural sector to the shocks that the Tunisian economy 
is undergoing has manifested itself during the two most important crises of the last 40 
years: that of the mid-1980s and that following the 2011 revolution. Thanks to its 
contribution to GDP growth, the agricultural sector has withstood much better than the 
industrial sector and has given certain stability to the Tunisian economy as a whole.

As regards exports, the use of statistical regressions over the period (1988-2014) enabled 
Bakari (2016) to show that agricultural exports have beneficial effects on Tunisia's 
economic growth as well as on non-agricultural exports10. 
Despite these positive results, the Tunisian agricultural sector remained fragile and 
dependent on both government subsidies and the import of its inputs.  
Today, and as shown in the following diagram, agricultural productivity is particularly 
low for cereals:

The economic growth experienced by the other sectors of the Tunisian economy has been 
to the detriment of the agricultural sector and not from - or thanks to - its development. 
According to Jouili (2008), "The deterioration in farmers' incomes is due to the 
"modernization" model imposed on agriculture since independence. Conceived as a 
simple superposition on the local reality of techniques and practices developed and 
practiced in other areas, this model, artificially supported by subsidies, could not bring 
about the synergy expected from any intensification process, namely a significant 
improvement in yields. The elimination of subsidies and the dismantling of various forms 
of state aid have thus highlighted its fragility. The consequence is a sudden and 
considerable increase in production costs, while yields are still structurally low, resulting 
in an increasingly pronounced deterioration in farmers' incomes. » 
2.3 Some data on undernourishment and malnutrition in Tunisia 
According to the report of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), 
the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO), the 
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Food 
Program (WFP), Tunisia's performance in terms of the health effects of food remains 
much better than that of other African countries (with the exception of Morocco and 
Rwanda)11. However, these results are stagnating or declining, mainly due to the rise in 
food prices after the revolution. The main characteristics of malnutrition and under-
nutrition in Tunisia are as follows:

 The rate of undernourished population in Tunisia increased from 5.6% between 
2004 and 2006 to 5% between 2014 and 2016 and 4,9 % between 2015 and 2017; 
 The wasting rate (weight loss and severe weight loss) in children is estimated in 
2016 at 2.8%; 
 Stunting in children increased from 9% in 2005 to 10.2% in 2016;  
 The overweight rate among children, increased from 8.8% in 2005 to 14.3% in 
2016 and 2017 (Tunisia is the only country that recorded such an increase); 
 Adult obesity increased from 18.5% (1.3 million people) in 2005 to 24.2% (1.9 
million people) in 2014 and 27,3% in 2016. 
In general, Tunisians suffer more from malnutrition (prevalence of obesity for children 
and adults) than from undernourishment 
2.4 Limitations of the neoliberal approach to food security in Tunisia 
The neoliberal approach to food security is based on the competitiveness of the entire 
economy and the country's trade balance, which should enable it to obtain supplies at any 
time and regardless of the evolution of world prices for the commodities consumed. In 
short, the stronger the economy and the more foreign exchange it has, the less dependent 
it is on its own agriculture and the more food security the country would achieve. 
This approach is defended in a recent African Development Bank report that proposes 
four main strategies for achieving food security for Maghreb countries12: 
- Make agriculture a source of foreign exchange by progressively abandoning production 
for local markets (cereals, dairy products, meat) and favoring export products where the 
country would have a comparative advantage and which would promote greater 
efficiency in water use. 
- Diversify the economy and exports so as to have foreign exchange and use a workforce 
whose purchasing power will thus be strengthened. This strategy assumes that the 
agricultural sector cannot be internationally competitive (due in particular to climate 
change that will affect supply and demographic and social changes that will shape 
demand) and emphasize economy diversification rather than agriculture consolidation. 
- Streamline imports: by improving logistics13; building strategic reserves to mitigate 
large price fluctuations; using financial instruments to create virtual stocks (futures or 
options contracts); building regional stocks or entering into reserve agreements; 
achieving economies of scale through multi-country procurement and implementing a 
regional system for food security and early warning14. 
- Improve agricultural productivity: This will contribute to food security by three 
mechanisms15:

 Increase the purchasing power of the rural poor who, through increased 
productivity, will be able to buy food;  
 Increase foreign exchange earnings from the export of agricultural products in 
areas where the countries of the region have a comparative advantage, which 
would then finance food imports;  
 
Increase local food production, and thereby reduce import needs.  
Being based on questionable assumptions, these recommendations do not say anything 
about the social and political dynamics underlying them. The food security, they are trying 
to achieve at the national level does not ensure the security of local populations nor the 
sovereignty of the country. On the contrary, they admit to sacrificing sovereignty in the 
hope of achieving security. Finally, it is important to recall that national food security is 
necessary but not sufficient to ensure individual food security and that the productivism 
already defended by the majority of "green revolutions" has failed, and has been a source 
of waste, inequality (at national and international levels) and overexploitation of natural 
resources. 
 
3. From food security to food sovereignty in Tunisia: an overview of 
main challenges 
A country cannot ensure its sovereignty if it does not guarantee its security. However, it 
turns out that certain policies aimed at ensuring food security end up compromising the 
sovereignty of countries and populations. Others see security only in the renunciation of 
sovereignty. We consider food security to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for 
sovereignty. While food sovereignty is an undeniable objective, it is still necessary, 
especially for a country with limited resources and accumulating transitions, such as 
Tunisia, to have the means and ensure the conditions for it. Many of these conditions are 
challenges shared by food security advocates.  
In this section, we will present the ten main challenges to Tunisia's food security by 
approaching them from the point of view of their contribution to food sovereignty. 
3.1 Water and Water Resources Mismanagement: the increased dependency 
Tunisia is a semi-arid country, with very variable rainfall and water resources globally 
threatened and unevenly distributed.  
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, water allocation is 79% for agriculture, 15% for 
food, 3% for industry and 1% for tourism16.  
Receiving on average 230 mm/year, or 36 billion m3/year and having in 2015 a reserve 
of 450 m3 of water per year and per capita, Tunisia is well below the water poverty line 
(500 m3 per person per year).  
                                                             
NOT fundamentally unequal". Christiaensen, L., Demery, L. et Kuhl, J. (2011). « The (Evolving) Role of Agriculture in 
Poverty Reduction – An Empirical Perspective », Journal of Development Economics, vol. 96, n° 2, pp.239-254. 
16 According to Tlili (2009), 86% of water resources (surface or groundwater) are mobilized 

12 
 
If no major changes occur in the coming years, water resources are expected to decrease 
from 1036 m3 per capita in the 1960s to 150 in 2050.  
The number of dams in Tunisia has increased from three in 1956 to 34 in 2015 and is 
expected to increase to 44 in 2020. Nevertheless, Tunisia's hydraulic barrages contain 
fewer and fewer reserves because of low rainfall, global warming and poor maintenance 
of infrastructure that is beginning to age. The siltation percentage of some large dams 
reaches 50%. Louati (2010) even predicts that by 2050, the dams currently in operation 
should lose 43% of their initial capacity. 
In addition to the decline in the quantities of water available for direct exploitation, water 
quality has deteriorated significantly. According to the National Agriculture Observatory 
(ONAGRI) (2015), nearly half of the waters (53%) have a salinity greater than 1.5 gr and 
35% exceed 2 gr. 
After the revolution, thousands of wells were illegally dug, leading to overexploitation of 
the water table and aggravation of this problem of available water quality. 
More frequent and lengthier, drinking water cuts have led to protests and social 
movements in the affected areas. 
The reinforcement of Tunisia's water potential by non-conventional waters is estimated 
at 150 Mm3 in 2016 at a rate of 60 Mm3 for desalinated waters and 90 Mm3 for treated 
and reused wastewater. According to the national sustainable development strategy 
(2014-2030), the potential of non-conventional waters should reach 330 Mm3 in 2030. 
Nevertheless, with the evolution of Tunisia's energy deficit and the worsening pollution 
problems, it is expected that the production costs of these non-conventional waters will 
rise. 
Water is wasted on transport and increasingly poorly maintained pipelines, on the choice 
of water-intensive crops, on the use of inappropriate irrigation techniques and on the 
pricing of drinking water, which is currently below its average cost. At all levels, from 
production to distribution and consumption, Tunisia still needs to implement water 
saving techniques. The financial difficulties of the public water company (SONEDE), which 
has a monopoly on water distribution, sell water at a loss, suffers from a plethora of staff 
and finds it increasingly difficult to get paid by its customers, make it even more difficult 
to maintain and renew installations. 
According to the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network (2016), "the water of some 
dams (those in the far north), although of good quality, is not exploited (and, in the case 
of the Sidi El Barrak dam, is discharged into the sea), under the pretext that the cost of 
pumping or transferring it is too high. However, the latter is much lower than the energy 
required to desalinate seawater. »17  
Tunisia also suffers from a regional imbalance in available water resources. While the 
North represents 80% of surface water, the South has only 5%. The government is

counting on the development of a system for transferring part of the water from the north 
to the center, Cap Bon and even Sfax, to make up the rainfall deficit and ensure a balance 
between the supply of drinking water and water intended for irrigation and the 
agricultural sector as a whole18. 
Finally, despite some protests from civil society, Tunisia's growing energy deficit is 
pushing the authorities towards the exploitation of schist gas. The report of the Euro-
Mediterranean Human Rights Network (2016), states that since 2013, SHELL has been 
allowed to explore schist gas in the Kairouan governorate. This hydraulic fracturing 
technique "represents a major danger to water resources, on the one hand, because it 
leads to overexploitation of these resources, and on the other hand, because it involves 
risks of contamination of groundwater, soil, air and aquatic environments by toxic 
substances added to the fracturing water".19 
3.2 Land sharing and soil quality 
In relation to land issues, two major structural problems threaten Tunisia's food, 
nutritional and agricultural security: on the one hand, the availability and distribution of 
agricultural land; and on the other, the quality of land that can be used for agricultural 
activities. 
a- The problem of land sharing and exploitation 
Tunisia is the smallest country in North Africa. Nevertheless, its geomorphology makes 
most of its territory cultivable. While arable land as a percentage of the territory 
decreased from 19.95% in 1961 to 18.67% in 2016 (this percentage rose from 4.39 to 
4.71% for the MENA region), agricultural land as a percentage of the entire territory 
increased from 55.66% in 1961 to 64.83% in 2016 (compared to an average of 33.30% 
for the MENA region in 2016) (World Bank, 2018) 
The irrigated area is estimated at 8% of the useful agricultural area and contributes to 
40% of the total production value (about 425 000 Ha). Despite the decline in set-aside 
land, the increase in the number of farms has meant that the useful agricultural area per 
farm and the irrigated agricultural area per farm have remained relatively stable. In fact, 
the average size of farms has not stopped decreasing and 75% of farms have less than 10 
hectares, while 54% of farms have barely 2 hectares20. 
In addition to the land whose ownership is private (nearly 6.2 million Ha), Tunisian 
agricultural land is divided between state land (nearly ½ million Ha), collective land (1.5 
million Ha), habous land (nearly 100,000 Ha), and the forest domain (1 million Ha).  
The problem of sharing the land and securing its ownership appeared with the installation 
of the French protectorate in Tunisia in 1881. Indeed, by introducing the land register in 
1885, the Protectorate authorities introduced a land tenure system favorable to

20 73 percent of landholdings were less than 10 hectares in 2006 versus 64 percent in 1976 (Ministère de l’agriculture 
et des ressources hydrauliques, Enquête sur les structures des exploitations Agricoles 200’-2005)

colonization21. The registration of land in the cadaster thus allowed the settlers who 
shared the country's fertile land to protect themselves against any disputes. Because in 
their overwhelming majority, the Tunisians did not register their land and were content 
to hold notarized titles tainted with numerous imperfections, it was possible to easily 
strip them of their land22. This trend of land expropriation accelerated after the First 
World War, due to the decline in French agricultural production. 
According to Baccouche (2013), "while the French settlers were satisfied with the soil, 
their government rushed to the subsoil instead". So that "the national liberation 
movement will recruit among the dissatisfied (fellahs) and subsoil (union members). » 
Elloumi (2013) argues that subsequently, the national state authorities exploited the 
weaknesses of the land tenure system introduced by the protectorate and, under the 
pretext of better integration of land into economic circuits, "accelerated the unification of 
the legal system by putting an end to certain traditional statutes, with the objective of 
imposing the monopoly of positive law whose manufacture they controlled" (Elloumi, 
2013). 
After 2011, the land and farms that had been allocated to Ben Ali's family members, 
relatives of the regime, public figures and some SMVDAs, were expropriated by the new 
government and entrusted to the Office of State Lands (OTD). But, while the Islamists of 
Ennahda, represented by the Minister of Agriculture, has sought to attract capital from 
the allied Gulf countries by facilitating investment in Tunisian lands, members of the 
Congress Party of the Republic (CPR), Ennahda’s ally in government and represented by 
the Minister of State Lands, have sought to increase their popularity by increasing the 
number of farms recovered (Elloumi, 2013). 
According to Professor Habib Ayeb, President of the Observatory of Food Sovereignty and 
Environment "Farmers with less than 5 hectares constitute 54% of the total number of 
producers and share 11% of the total agricultural area. At the same time, those with more 
than 50 hectares are only 3% of the total number of farmers but use 34% of the total 
agricultural land. If we take into account the fact that the one who has 20 hectares of well 
irrigated land is already part of what are called investors, the proportion of agricultural 
land available to "large producers" is even higher. »23 
With the physical and legal fragmentation of land, a problem of securing land ownership 
has emerged. Thus, after the revolution, it was estimated that 65,000 hectares were 
illegally occupied by people who took advantage of the weakening of the state to settle on 
its land.

According to the Tunisian Union of Agriculture and Fisheries (UTAP), problems of 
availability of property titles concern 40,000 farmers and 350 thousand hectares of 
agricultural land.  
The challenge of transparency and equity in the granting of certain lands and farms to 
agricultural development and development companies and the desire to improve the 
efficiency of the allocation of land lots to young people (especially unemployed graduates) 
has led the State to draw up new specifications for the granting of state land. The “Bureau 
de restructuration des Terres domaniales agricoles” (BRTDA) ensures compliance with 
these specifications and the “Agence de Promotion des Investissements Agricoles” (APIA) 
has the possibility of withdrawing exploitation rights when the promoter does not respect 
its commitments24. 
Encouraged by the implementation of the structural adjustment program, the 
revitalization of the land market, which aimed at an "optimal allocation" of resources in 
general and lands in particular, has limited smallholders' access to land. Jouili, (2008) 
states that land policy has no other objective than to "grant the small farmer a property 
title allowing him to sell his land the day he needs it, and he will most probably have it. » 
b- The problem of soil quality and desertification 
While 46% of agricultural plantations are carried out on lands with limited fertility, it is 
estimated that 96% of the Tunisian territory is directly or indirectly concerned by the risk 
of desertification (ITES, 2017). 
In the meantime, according to FAO (2008), 62% of the land in central and northern 
Tunisia is affected by erosion. In the South, only 17.2% of land is not directly threatened 
by desertification or erosion. If the scenario predicted by INRA of an average temperature 
increase of 2 degrees by 2050 were to come true, this would mean that all the Maghreb 
countries would lose 50% of their arable land. Moreover, about 78% of the country's 
surface area (12 million ha) are affected by medium to high salinization. This salinization 
removes nearly 3000 Ha of irrigated productive land each year (Selim, Abassi, 2013). 
Even though Tunisia has a national council to combat desertification and has developed 
many water and soil conservation programs, these risks are aggravated by the loss of 
ancestral soil conservation traditions, over-exploitation of land for production, the use 
(encouraged by the State) of cereal monoculture and the lack of data on local soil 
characteristics25.  
3.3 Climate change, food security and loss of sovereignty 
The study by ITES26 (2017) showed that during the twentieth century, Tunisia 
experienced an average ten-year rise in temperature of +2.39°C. A USAID study (2015) 
shows that by 2050, the temperature increase will reach 1.8 to 2.7°C. The same study also 
forecasts an annual reduction in rainfall of -4.1% to -6.8%. Finally, sea levels should rise 
                                                             
24 In particular the implementation of the investment and upgrading programs, job creation and supervision. 
25 Tunisia has a network of 14 soil analysis laboratories but this network is insufficiently exploited by Tunisian farmers. 
26 ITES : Institut Tunisien des Etudes Stratégiques 

16 
 
by 3 to 61 cm and 1% to 3% of the territory should even be affected by a 1 meter rise in 
sea level. 
According to a recent ONAGRI document, "The high variability of climate combined with 
an unevenly distributed water resource in space and time, have made drought the most 
significant risk affecting the agricultural sector, farmers' income, and the state budget". In 
periods of increasingly severe drought, phases of heavy rainfall and even floods are 
superimposed, which affect agricultural land without being useful for groundwater 
recharge.  
This same ONAGRI study states, "the measures adopted so far have been reactive rather 
than proactive and remain insufficient"27. It is therefore necessary to integrate climate 
risks into development plans and programs by adopting the "Climate Proofing" 
methodological approach, developing agricultural insurance based on a public/private 
partnership and training farmers in managing this risk, which has become systemic. 
Initially, these climate-related challenges led Tunisia to ratify the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (1993) and adopt the Kyoto Protocol (2002). 
Secondly, it has put in place a national strategy for adapting the agricultural sector to 
climate change and a national strategy for adapting the coastline to sea-level rise. 
3.4 Loss of biodiversity, Bio insecurity, and Genetic Heritage  
a- GMOs and biosafety of imported food products 
After the creation of the Gene bank, Tunisian governments have shown more good 
intentions than effective and concrete actions to guarantee food biosafety. 
For example, despite the adoption of the national Agenda 21 since 1996, which 
incorporates precautionary requirements, Tunisian legislation remains silent on this 
principle. Similarly, having ratified (since 2002) the "Cartagena Protocol" on the 
prevention of the risks of modern biotechnologies, Tunisia has still not put in place the 
legal framework for the labeling and traceability of products.  
In addition, a draft law on biosafety has been pending since the early 2000s. In the absence 
of control, there is still some opacity about the presence of GMOs in imported products. 
This problem concerns both certain imported food products (in particular soybean oil, 
maize, and their derivatives) and seeds used in agricultural activities. 
Tunisia has four laboratories involved in the detection of GMOs28 that benefit from quality 
infrastructures, but have important training and human resources recruitment needs, if 
only to be able to adapt to technological evolutions. 
b- Pesticide Uses and Quality 
Tunisia imports nearly 5,000 tons of pesticides annually and grants 700 import 
authorizations. About 150 import control operations are carried out and 600 samples are

analyzed29. The use of pesticides and fertilizers has increased, in particular because of the 
use of hybrid seeds supposed to improve the productivity of farms in accordance with the 
objectives of national authorities. For example, according to the Yearbook of Agriculture 
Statistics (2014), the area of cereals treated with pesticides in the North of the country 
increased from less than 500,000 Ha in 2004 to 576,000 Ha in 2014 which represent 
44,26% from the total30. 
According to the ITES strategic review (2017), old stocks of insecticides banned in Europe 
are still being sold in Tunisia. Bouguerra (2016), states that a survey conducted in 2007 
showed that 1170 tons of obsolete pesticides are spread over 150 sites and 230 stores31. 
For its part, Dekhil (2017), Director of Environmental Product Control, states, "Only 16% 
of retailers know the meaning of the pictograms on the labels of the packaging of 
pesticides they market and no retailer has the safety data sheet"32. Dekhil also claims that 
the “Agence Nationale de Contrôle Sanitaire et Environnemental des Produits” (ANCSEP) 
has obtained a grant to finance the implementation of a National Vigilance System to 
control risks related to Pesticides in Tunisia (SNVP). 
Another study conducted by the ANCSEP in 2005, concerning the existence of pesticides 
in the food chain, stressed the need to update the Tunisian standard that deals with the 
maximum tolerated pesticide residue limits33. 
The ANCSEP has also assessed the state of the control laboratories. It recommended to 
strengthen laboratories with equipment and human skills; assist laboratories that have 
the required prerequisites in setting up a quality system with a view to accreditation and 
consolidate those that are already accredited and to create a network of qualified 
laboratories by field of competence and respecting the geographical distribution 
necessary for regional balance. 
c- The dependence on seeds and pesticides and the erosion of the national 
genetic heritage  
Even though Tunisia has long been one of the main world producers of phosphates, and 
has developed a certain autonomy in terms of fertilizers, today, with nearly 72% of the 
world pesticide market and 61% of the seed market controlled by three large 
multinationals (Clapp, 2017) 34, Tunisia is forced to suffer the consequences of this 
concentration phenomenon.

Indeed, because of the poverty of peasants who have difficulty developing to become 
independent farmers and the imperative of competitiveness for exporters whose main 
sales argument is the products low prices, it becomes difficult to reconcile economic and 
ecological logic to get out of the trap of dependence on so-called modern agriculture. 
The intensification of agriculture and the massive use of imported varieties has led to the 
near extinction of many local varieties. “Improved” seeds have gradually displaced local 
seeds and led to the dependence of many Tunisian farmers. 
This is particularly the case for national cattle breeds, which have practically disappeared 
(ITES, 2017). However, if local species do not seem competitive in the short term, they are 
of better quality and especially more resistant to climatic hazards which are becoming 
important in Tunisia. 
Genetic erosion is also linked to international trade considerations: while export remains 
subject to the presentation of a certificate of no genetic transformation, Tunisia does not 
put barriers to the import of genetically modified products. 
To address these biosecurity challenges, Tunisia has established a gene bank that does 
important work both to protect and repatriate local species and to help farmers recover 
local techniques and species. Tunisia has also adopted a biosecurity strategy that includes 
policy, legal and institutional guidelines and capacity-building guidelines35. 
3.5 The issue of Agricultural Human Resources 
This issue refers to four dimensions: rural women who play a key role in agriculture, 
young people and the low-skilled agricultural workforce, agricultural graduates and 
entrepreneurs, and human resources involved in agricultural administration and farmer 
management structures.  
a- The situation of rural women 
Rural women constitute the bulk of the Tunisian agricultural labor force: 509208 women 
are active in this sector, 427534 of whom are unpaid family workers36. But despite 
Tunisia's progress in gender equality, rural women are still heavily penalized with regard 
to access to property and land, guarantees to access credit; access to social security37 and 
education38 and opportunities for monitoring and extension assistance39. 
Thus, the feminization of Tunisian agriculture and the transition of women from peasant 
to agricultural worker status is synonymous with precariousness, dependence, and 
aggravation of inequalities in society in general and in the agricultural sector in particular. 
b- Youth, rural exodus and lack of interest in agriculture

Agricultural labor is becoming scarcer, more feminine and rapidly aging. While the share 
of agriculture in total national employment continues to fall, the percentage of farmers 
aged 60 and over is now around 60%.  
With these demographic changes, it is also traditional knowledge that tends to be lost or 
marginalized in favor of more "modern" techniques, often beyond the reach of small 
farmers and which have not given way to innovation and the development of locally 
anchored technical alternatives.  
The first wave of emigration is linked to the social lift that came along the Tunisian 
education system. This has led to a qualified rural migration to settle in the city and work 
in the Tunisian administration or private companies. 
The poor living conditions, the fragmentation of agricultural land, the problems of 
profitability of agricultural activities, the wage differential between the agricultural sector 
and other sectors in terms of labor (notably the industrial and construction sectors) and 
the so-called "active policies” to combat unemployment in the cities largely explain the 
ongoing rural exodus which worsened after the revolution. 
This exodus was stronger in Tunisia than in the countries of the MENA region and the 
average of the rest of the world:

Tunisian agriculture suffers from a waste of natural, human and knowledge resources 
necessary for agricultural development (ITES, 2017). 
This process of abandoning agriculture is dependent on the growth of industrial and non-
agricultural jobs. Indeed, “the small farmer abandons his exploitation only in the hope of 
finding a more stable and remunerative job elsewhere. In the absence of such a 
perspective, it tends to remain in place, even if it means reproducing itself in poverty and 
precariousness.” (Jouili, 2008).

c- Diploma courses and qualifications in agricultural fields 
Tunisia is experiencing a drop in the number of graduated agricultural technicians (111 
in 2014) to the benefit of engineers, doctors, and veterinarians (1538 in 2014)40. This 
inversion of the training pyramid is more problematic as it corresponds to an increase in 
graduate unemployment. 
The following figure illustrates this growing imbalance between the number of technical 
graduates and those from agricultural university training:

d- Farm administration and management structures 
Tunisia has an Agricultural Extension and Training Agency (AVFA), which groups 24 
coordination units at governorate level, 187 territorial extension units (CTV) at 
delegation level and 849 agricultural extension units (CRA) at a local level. Other actors 
intervene on a more ad hoc basis in training/extension activities. These include the offices 
concerned by the activity in question; the Regional Agricultural Development 
Commissions (CRDAs); agricultural unions and various international development 
organizations. However, the extension system currently has only 414 full-time equivalent 
extension workers, or a ratio of 1 extension worker for 1246 farmers (ITES, 2017). 
This lack of supervision penalizes farmers who do not have the financial means to use 
private agricultural advisors. 
The problem of farmers' supervision is also linked to that of the weak structuring of basic 
professional organizations and the lack of coordination between institutions. Thus, of the

516,000 farms, only 27,000 farmers belong to mutual agricultural service companies 
(SMSA) (Bessaoud, Ton Nu, 2017)41. 
Combined with the low mechanization of Tunisian agriculture, these factors contribute to 
the low productivity of agricultural work in Tunisia:

prices)

3.6 Agri-food competitiveness as a means for State sovereignty 
Business climate: the Tunisian business climate deteriorated markedly in the years 
following the revolution. It rose from 69 in 2010 to 88 in 2018. Unfair competition 
(resulting in particular from the development of the informal sector), smuggling (of 
products from Libya or Algeria in particular), violence (linked to terrorism and decline of 
State authority), bureaucracy (linked to procedures that are as numerous as they are 
inefficient) and the deterioration of the social climate are all factors of a bad business 
climate. 
a- Logistics and distribution channels: The growing deficit in the State budget weighs 
heavily on the maintenance and development of today's aging infrastructure 
necessary for the production and transport of agricultural products. Their limited 
storage capacities make farmers dependent on a few intermediaries or wholesalers 
who thus succeed in imposing their market conditions. As regards cereals, an ITES 
study (2016) concluded, "collection and storage capacity does not meet the needs of 
the sector and presents serious risks during good harvest years"42. According to 
Rastoin and Benabderrazik (2014), over the last ten years, collection rates for cereals 
have not exceeded 52% for durum wheat, 17% for barley, 59% for common wheat and 
13% for Triticale43.

Besides collection and storage problems, and although there are no official figures, 
agricultural losses due to logistical and distribution problems seem to be significant. Thus, 
"whereas developing countries essentially experience losses of foodstuffs intended for 
consumption and developed countries suffer more from discarded food waste, Tunisia 
seems to suffer both phenomena at the same time" (ITES, 2017).  
b- Agro-food industries: with a thousand private companies and a little over 70,000 
employees, the agro-food industry contributes nearly 3% of Tunisian GDP. A relatively 
stable rate since 2010. This industry has accompanied the change in consumption habits 
of Tunisians and the emergence of mass distribution. The challenge of local processing of 
agricultural products has led the State to formulate a program to support the quality 
certification of companies in the sector and the creation of an industrial zone dedicated 
to food industries. Nevertheless, this sector also faces many constraints, including large 
fluctuations in the level of agricultural production due to climatic conditions, poor 
coordination between the sector's players and barriers to entry into foreign markets. 
3.7 Access to finance as a source of inequality 
Despite the existence of a public agricultural bank44, the Tunisian agricultural sector 
remains under-banked and few farmers have access to bank credit. 
In an attempt to facilitate the financing of small farmers, the agricultural policy of the 
1990s will over-indebt them and create major inequalities in access to credit (Baccouche, 
2013). According to UTAP45, less than 7% of farmers have access to bank credit and 
commercial banks contribute only 15% of total agricultural investments. Two-thirds of 
farmers' debts to banks consist of interest and late payment penalties46.

According to Jouili (2008), 77.5% of farms are economically unviable from a banking 
eligibility point of view. As a result, the majority of farmers are excluded from bank 
financing, while those who have access to it quickly find themselves over-indebted.  
These difficulties are much greater for women: according to Mahfoudh (2013), 52.8% of 
women wishing to launch a project are penalized by the lack of sources of funding. This 
rate is only 73.7% for men47. 
Finally, despite the worsening weather conditions, agricultural insurance still represents 
only 2.78% of the Tunisian insurance market. Established at the end of the 1980s, the 
national fund to guarantee agricultural activities in the face of natural disasters suffered 
from multiple dysfunctions and it was only in 2017 that the government decided to 
relaunch it as a solidarity fund benefiting from tripartite financing (State, consumers and 
farmers). 
3.8 The Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) with Europe: a 
deadly threat? 
Announced for 2019, the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) with 
the European Union (EU), is strongly criticized and presented as a serious threat to 
Tunisian agriculture.  
Even, if the European market weighs for more than 500 million consumers, agricultural 
products constitute only 8.5% of Tunisian exports to the European Union while 6% of 
total Tunisian imports, from the EU, consist of agri-food products. 
Since 2001, the European Union and Tunisia have agreed to "mutual concessions".  Those 
granted to Tunisian exports of agricultural products vary according to their nature and 
the sensitivity of the products for the European market. Four cases are foreseen48: 
1. 
Total exemption from customs duties, with no restrictions on the quantities traded 
or the export period;  
2. 
Total exemption from customs duties, with limitations on the export period;  
3. 
Total exemption from customs duties for a given quota; and  
4. 
A partial reduction of customs duties, without any quantitative restrictions.  
In return, Tunisia undertook, on the one hand, to offer the EU preferential market access 
for cereals, meat and dairy products and, on the other hand, under the GATT agreements, 
to consolidate its concessions. 
Supporters of Tunisia's accession to the DCFTA with the European Union cite four main 
arguments in its favor: 
- Tunisian farmers would have access to the European market of 500 million consumers, 
- Farmers could align their prices with those of the world market,

onze gouvernorats de la Tunisie, secrétariat d’Etat de la femme et de la famille. 
48 http://www.aleca.tn/2016/11/pourquoi-la-tunisie-doit-elle-avancer-sur-laleca/ 

24 
 
- Tunisia would receive assistance to upgrade its agriculture, 
- The implementation of DCFTA would be gradual and sectoral. 
In reality, the European and global market is not as accessible as it is presented. They 
remain dominated by large operators against whom small Tunisian farmers could not 
resist. Moreover, Tunisian peasants would have little chance of complying with European 
standards and input prices will only increase. 
Other DCFTA critics insist on the negative consequences that the 1995 EU-Tunisia 
Association Agreement would have had on the Tunisian economy.  
While the outcome of the 1995 Association Agreement is mixed and difficult to assess, 
some DCFTA advocates acknowledge its weaknesses in order to better defend the idea of 
a deepening of economic relations. In other words, the 1995 agreement had negative 
consequences precisely because it would not have been sufficiently "comprehensive" and 
"deep". 
In this debate between experts who do not share the same hypotheses, nor the same 
interests, it seems important to stress that national sovereignty could be strengthened by 
better regional security and deeper cooperation between Tunisia and its geopolitical 
environment. Nevertheless, this deeper cooperation requires common policies and not 
only free trade. Tunisia could therefore, rely on the Maghreb, North Africa, the Arab world 
or even Europe to improve its food security and indirectly its national sovereignty. 
However, this requires real cooperation to develop fair common public policies and not 
only a deepening of international trade and free trade. For the time being, these conditions 
do not seem to be met, due to the lack of transparency of the Tunisian authorities on an 
issue that risks being politicized and the uncertainties of the European Union's 
neighborhood policy. 
3.9 Food security and sovereignty through science, information, and technology 
Food security and sovereignty should not be confused with the protection of some acquis, 
nor with the defense of a vital minimum. This security also implies innovating production 
processes, diversifying agricultural production and multiplying forms of agriculture or 
developing viable agricultural alternatives. 
In turn, these imperatives require the development of agricultural scientific research, the 
exploitation of ICTs and the exploration of alternative forms of agriculture. 
a- Agricultural scientific research 
Agricultural innovation is inseparable from scientific research. Today, Tunisia has 22 
agricultural education and research organizations. Tunisia's research yearbook (2018) 
shows that there are 29 laboratories and 10 research units working directly on 
agricultural issues. Other research structures are working on important issues for 
agriculture, such as biotechnology, biodiversity or physiopathology. 

25 
 
A recent evaluation report shows the main weaknesses of scientific research in general 
and agricultural research in particular in Tunisia49. These include:  
- The fragmentation of structures and the dispersion of resources and efforts; 
- The lack of valorization of the results of scientific research; 
- The brain drain that increased after 2011; 
- Poor coordination of structures and programs linked to dual supervision (Ministry of 
Agriculture, Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research); 
- The lack of interest of companies in scientific research; 
- Segmentation between universities and research centers; 
- The status of teacher-researchers that do not encourage continuing scientific research; 
- The evaluation of research structures remains complex, not very transparent and with 
uncertain benefit; 
- The interface structures between public research and the business sector are often 
inefficient and poorly positioned. 
b- ICT exploitation and smart agriculture 
The use of ICT in Tunisian agriculture is in its infancy. Recently, a 93.1 million Euro World 
Bank funded loan project, planned a 56 million US$ sub-component "Smart and 
Sustainable Agricultural Practices". In the same direction, the Ministry of Communication 
Technologies and Digital Economy recently took advantage of the 2017 Agriculture, 
Machinery and Fisheries Fair to organize the first "Smart Agriculture Hackathon". Finally, 
between 2017 and 2018, a budget of 300 000 Euros was dedicated by the German 
cooperation to the implementation of a new digital application "Plantix Tunisia"50.  
However, these efforts are still penalized by the low financial capacities of farmers who 
are not always convinced by IT solutions nor able to master them well. These efforts are 
also penalized by legal and security considerations. This is the case, for example, for the 
use of drones in agriculture, which remains subject to dissuasive authorizations.  
3.10 Poverty, regional imbalance and social transfers 
Four major public policy programs were mobilized in order to fight poverty and promote 
regional imbalance 51:

PASRI 
50 It is a partnership between the German cooperation GIZ, the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and Fisheries 
(APIA, AVFA, DGPCQPA), PEAT (German Startup and owner of Plantix), Royal Green Technologies (Tunisian Startup) 
and the association Appui aux Initiatives de Développement (A.I.D). Developed in Germany in 2015, the Plantix 
application is a digital decision support tool. It is a digital solution for smartphones that allows farmers to identify 
diseases and pests that attack their plants through photos and to quickly access information on curative and preventive 
control methods. 
51 Other programs less directly related to food security could also be mentioned: school aid, regional 
workcamps, housing aid, aid granted under active employment policies, etc. 

26 
 
a- 
The general compensation fund: set up in 1971 for a one-off intervention to 
rationalize subsidies, this fund has been used to subsidize products as diverse as bread, 
milk, sugar, meat, soybean meal, rapeseed oil, corn, school books, cultural books, milk 
collection, potato seed, fertilizers and even cement. After the fall of the Ben Ali regime, the 
situation of this fund deteriorated rapidly and its expenses went from 730 million dinars 
in 2010 to 1605 million dinars in 2017. 
In terms of targeting the poorest populations, food subsidies are weakly effective. Indeed, 
according to data from the 2010 National Budget and Consumption Survey, only 9.2% of 
subsidies go to the poorest households, 60.5% to middle-class households, 7.5% to the 
rich population and 22.8% are transferred outside households (restaurants, cafés, 
tourists, illegal cross-border trade). 
b- 
The national program to help needy families (PNAFN): Launched in 1986, the 
main objective of this program was to limit compensation expenditures within a vision 
favoring direct targeting instead of the universal subsidy system used with the General 
Compensation Fund. 
The number of beneficiaries of this program has increased sharply since 1987, from 78 
000 in 1987 to 118 000 in 2010 and 235 000 in 2014. To date, it is the only cash transfer 
program in effect. 
Targeting 8.3% of all the poorest households, this program only reaches 3.9% of them, 
i.e., an accuracy rate of 47%. 
c- 
The national school-feeding program: Aware of the importance of the school 
feeding program in promoting the attendance of pupils from disadvantaged areas and in 
increasing their learning capacities, the Tunisian Government has decided to relaunch this 
program on a large scale and has requested, to this end, the continuation of the 
partnership with the World Food Program. 
d- 
The Reduced Fee Access to Health Care program (AMG2): launched in 1998, 
this program provides its beneficiaries with reduced-fee access to health care within 
public health structures for a fixed annual fee of 10 dinars. Families benefiting from AMG2 
represent 21.7% of all families (those ranking just after the 8.3% of the poorest 
households) but this program only affects 10.9% of this 21.7%, which is an accuracy rate 
of 50.2% (CRES, AfDB, 2015). 
While the PNAFN, the school assistance program and the AMG2 implement a strong 
targeting for disadvantaged regions in the west of the country and for rural areas, the 
absence of a unified database of all social assistance granted means that some families 
could combine the benefits while others do not have access to them. 
4. Food sovereignty in Tunisia: the role of the State, political parties 
and civil society. 
4.1 Food sovereignty in Tunisia: some remarks and elements of a definition 
There is often a great deal of confusion between food security and food sovereignty. In 
other cases, these two approaches are completely opposed. However, several authors 

27 
 
insist on the complementarities and bridges that it would be useful to establish between 
these two paradigms52. 
Even if the right to food is said to be central to both approaches, the difference between 
food sovereignty and food security lies in the way in which the objective of feeding the 
entire population is achieved. 
Five remarks deserve attention: 
- First of all, the concepts of food security and food sovereignty are developing, evolving 
and are subject to appropriation and instrumentalization that leave little room for 
theoretical details and nuances. In fact, while it is always useful in theory to establish links 
between security and sovereignty issues, in activism it is difficult to accommodate 
theoretical nuances. This often leads to a double misunderstanding linked to rather 
dogmatic and stigmatizing positions: on the one hand, "sovereigntists" accuse 
"securityists" of being bearers of a neo-liberal ideology of a (farming) economy without 
farmers (or peasants) and at their expense. On the other hand, "securityists" accuse 
"sovereigntists" of being neo-conservatives or neo-protectionists and of being carriers of 
the utopia of an agriculture that would free itself from market logic because people are 
supposed to "produce what they consume and consume what they produce" at the 
national, local and individual levels. 
- Second, food sovereignty is a political movement that, in the case of Tunisia, lacks 
resources and structuration. However, it is also both a theoretical approach and a 
conceptual framework for interpreting and understanding reality and the result of 
concrete actions taken by the State, peasants and farmers alike. As such, it covers tensions 
and arbitrations and assumes the resolution of a number of contradictions and conflicts 
between the interests involved53.  
- Third, food sovereignty considers that the achievements of public agricultural policies 
are linked to decision-making procedures and so that food security results from 
democratic processes and proactive policies that combat inequalities, vulnerabilities and 
dependencies rather than from free market mechanisms.  
- Fourth, the duality of food security through sovereignty or security through markets and 
competitiveness overlaps with another equally important duality: that of the formal or 
real right to food. In fact, food security and food sovereignty cannot be completely 
separated. Without sovereignty, security may not be sustainable and ultimately 
undermine its own foundations. However, without security, sovereignty could be nothing 
more than a mere political slogan. 
                                                             
52 See for example: Marc Edelman, Tony Weis, Amita Baviskar, Saturnino M. Borras Jr, Eric Holt-Giménez, Deniz 
Kandiyoti & Wendy Wolford (2014) Introduction: critical perspectives on food sovereignty, The Journal of 
Peasant Studies, 41:6, 911-931; and Marc Edelman (2014) Food sovereignty: forgotten genealogies and future 
regulatory challenges, The Journal of Peasant Studies, 41:6, 959-978 
53 According to Agarwal (2014): "food self-sufficiency, diversity, agroecology, community, democracy and equality is 
undeniably attractive and important, but some elements can also be in serious conflict with others in practice (...) 
national self-sufficiency goals cannot translate simply into local or household self-sufficiency goals."Bina Agarwal, 
Food sovereignty, food security and democratic choice: critical contradictions, difficult conciliations, The Journal of 
Peasant Studies, 2014 Vol. 41, No. 6, 1247–1268 

28 
 
- Finally, while Via Campesina defines food sovereignty as the "right of populations, their 
States or Unions to define their agricultural and food policy", the Tunisian democratic 
transition has shown all the difficulties to exercise such a right. For example, Tunisia's 
latest development plan (2016-2020) was presented as participatory and in stark 
contrast to the centralizing planning practices of the Ben Ali regime. However, it was soon 
realized that people were not really prepared to participate in decision-making, that they 
did not have the means to control and participate in implementation, that the concern of 
the most vulnerable was limited to short-term demands and that arbitration and 
coherence could not be ensured by participation alone. On the contrary, this participation 
has exacerbated regionalism and local conflicts over the means of the state as a rent to be 
shared. In other words, the right to participate in policy making is much more complex 
than the definition suggests and it is not enough for the democratic transition to be 
described as successful, for participation to be real and transformative, rather than formal 
and disappointing. 
 
4.2 Food sovereignty and the changing roles of the State 
From a strict point of view, the end of the French protectorate meant the recovery of the 
sovereignty of the Tunisian Nation. Nevertheless, this sovereignty of the Nation was to be 
constructed and defended on the economic and political side. Very soon, it has been 
confused with absolute domination of the State over the society and an increased 
dependence of the populations on the center of power. In the name of reforms, everything 
was happening as if the consolidation of state sovereignty required increased dependence 
on the people and a progressive deprivation of their rights. 
By taking back from the settlers the best resources they confiscated for themselves, and 
by affirming that he wanted to organize their exploitation by the populations, the State 
began by appropriating these resources and then turned them into an element of its 
political domination over society as a whole.  
Lacking a development model and the means to diversify away from the agricultural 
practices and sectors developed by the settlers for the benefit of the French colonizer, the 
new independent Tunisian state confused the modernization of its agriculture with its 
extroversion and the ability to export to European markets in general and France in 
particular. According to Jouili (2008), the actions of the State "far from aiming at a real 
promotion of the peasantry and the rural world, most often take on an ideological aspect 
in order to defend the socio-political legitimacy of the State. All the more so as their scope 
and continuity are increasingly hampered by the reduction in budgetary resources.” 
Gradually, the Tunisian social state became a protective, clientelist and disempowering 
state. Instead of promoting the capacity for self-organization and thus the sovereignty of 
the populations, it increased their dependency, and with the Ben Ali regime, it wanted to 
impose on them a forced march towards modernization through economic liberalism, 
increased surveillance, control and domination. Resources and inputs to the agricultural 
sector (Typically land, financial resources and crops) became the backbone of a political 

29 
 
patronage directed by the RCD party, and a privilege for those close to the regime and the 
president's family. 
In terms of the structuring of social groups, the combination of the economic development 
and social insurance model under Ben Ali's rule aimed to keep farmers alive, to ensure 
the political adherence or neutralization of middle-class consumers and to promote a 
class of sub-contractors-at first- and exporters-at the second stage.  
After the fall of the Ben Ali regime, in the name of freedom, revolution and the return to 
identity, all state institutions were called into question, leading to a crisis of authority and 
a growing inability of the executive power to meet the people’s expectations.  
These expectations have been fueled by the race for power of parties with no experience 
of government, no real democratic traditions, weak roots in the society and a strong 
tendency to favor simplistic, ineffective and demagogic solutions or populist and short-
term proposals. At the same time, state authority has been weakened by the emergence 
of new actors and new social demands based on corporatism or regionalism, while 
political instability has been aggravated by weak or false compromises. 
As a result, if it is more democratic, Tunisia after 2011 is more dependent on foreign 
funding, less productive and respectful of its natural environment, more unstable and 
therefore less sovereign.  
The marginalization and subordination of agriculture to other sectors of the Tunisian 
economy, is the result of several policies: Economic policy focused on tourism, industrial 
subcontracting and phosphate; social policy having bet on the emergence of the urbanized 
middle class and bought social peace through food subsidies; educational policy having 
devalued manual labor and idealized the school social elevator; environmental policy 
marginalized or entrusted to ministries that consume the most natural resources. 
While the discourse of food self-sufficiency was a constant in the different national 
development plans, there was no real and coherent public policy for food security (ITES, 
2017), and agriculture was approached from the perspective of control, social peace and 
its potential contribution to the perpetuation of a securitarian regime.  
Rather than focusing on a harmonious, balanced and synergistic development between 
agriculture, industry and services, the state-led development model validated by the 
social partners, has led to the definition of a guaranteed minimum wage in the industrial 
sector that is much higher than that of the agricultural sector. This choice pushed the 
latter to take refuge in a form of institutionalized precariousness and informality. In the 
meantime, these industrial and service sectors were all the less inclined to draw the 
agricultural sector, since they were themselves built in a logic of rent and predation of the 
State's resources. In other words, agriculture has subsidized the rest of the economy and 
the precariousness of most of its actors has indirectly contributed to building Tunisia's 
comparative advantages. While being oriented towards exports and foreign investment, 
industry and services came to compete and strip agriculture of the resources that could 
have been allocated to it. It is this development model that has accentuated the country's 
two main issues: regional imbalance and youth unemployment.

4.3 The role of political parties and agricultural unions 
a- Political parties 
Before the fall of the Ben Ali regime, a certain political ecology developed in Tunisia with 
two parties which, because of the authoritarianism of the regime and the lack of 
awareness of the issues of that time, did not have a real popular base. 
The first, "Tunisie la verte" was created in 2004 but could not obtain an authorization to 
exercise from the government. This opposing party was nevertheless able to develop 
relations with the European Green Parties and after 2011, it was able to be part of the 
council of the higher authority for the achievement of the objectives of the revolution. 
Having joined and then abandoned a coalition of left-wing parties (the "popular front"), 
this political party was unable to win the elections and seemed to have great difficulty in 
positioning itself in Tunisia after 2011.  
The second "Green Party for Progress" was created in 2005 and quickly recognized in 
2006. With the objective of "strengthening the environmental awareness of Tunisians", 
this party was reputed to be close to the Ben Ali regime54 and was able to participate in 
the elections in 2009 and win six seats. After 2011, the party's president was banned from 
traveling in connection with the Ben Ali regime's political party financing affair, but was 
able to continue to participate in the elections without having any real political weight. 
After 2011, a new party called "La voix des agriculteurs" ran in the 2014 legislative 
elections with six electoral lists and succeeded in obtaining a seat in the National 
Assembly. Nevertheless, this party seems to depend on its president who, as a Member of 
Parliament, shines through his highly controversial media appearances, often mixing 
populism and regionalism55.  
b- The unions 
At the trade union level, two main structures defend the interests of Tunisian farmers and 
peasants.  
The first, UTAP (Union Tunisienne de l'Agriculture et de Pêche) was born after Tunisia's 
independence and was, for a very long time, closely controlled by the ruling government 
and associated with the activities of the then single party. Largely financed by the State 
for 75% of its budget, this structure drew its strength from the number of farmers who 
were practically obliged to join in order to obtain farming status and thus benefit from 
State aid. 
After the end of Ben Ali's regime, this structure elected a close president of the Islamist 
party Ennahda as its head and saw a split from some of its leading members who 
presented themselves as "reformers" and created a second agricultural union (SYNAGRI: 
Syndicat des Agriculteurs de Tunisie). 
                                                             
54 it had supported its candidature for the 2009 presidential elections 
55 Recently, in March 2017, the Tunis court decided to expel this president from a 220-hectare farm he was illegally 
farming in northwest Tunisia, which did not fail to discredit this leader who said he spoke on behalf of the poor. 

31 
 
Today, although often ignored by the authorities in power, this structure, which claims to 
be independent, has gained ground and seems to attract relatively well-trained and 
organized young farmers. 
Attracting farmers and small farmers, often motivated by subsidies in the first case, and a 
few young bosses more rooted in the so-called modern agricultural sector than in 
traditional peasantry, in the second case, these two structures “act in parallel and not in 
synergy”56,. Even if sometimes they are consulted, these unions have difficulty in 
stimulating, organizing and supervising collective movements of farmers, and in 
effectively influencing national policies. 
All in all, despite the democratization of the political field, the government remains 
"rather deaf to the demands of small farmers, refusing in particular, to accede to requests 
for debt cancellation that threaten to expropriate many of them and (...) in a logic of 
bringing agricultural organizations under control, the new authorities do not welcome the 
emergence of an agricultural trade union pluralism" (Gana, 2013)57. 
4.4 Civil society, social movements and other food sovereignty actors in Tunisia 
Apart from the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources and a few other ministries 
(notably the Ministry of Environment and Trade), which are involved in the regulation of 
the agricultural sector, Tunisia's agricultural institutional landscape is made up of 
associations, mutual societies, and unions. 
a- Agricultural and environmental associations and civil society 
The Tunisian NGO sector has always been closely controlled by the Ben Ali regime. After 
2011, there has been a real explosion in this sector. This includes "classic" associations 
and "Agricultural Development Groups". 
The number of traditional associations has increased from 10,000 in 2010 to 21,776 in 
2018. Of these, 548 declare themselves as environmental58. According to several 
observers, it is this dynamism of civil society that has enabled Tunisia to avoid the crises 
experienced by other "Arab spring" countries. Nevertheless, despite this dynamism, 
Tunisian civil society still suffers from many weaknesses, including59 : 
- Economic dependence on state subsidies or foreign aid; 
- The absence of State aid or support structures; 
- Poor knowledge of the legal, financial and accounting aspects; 
- Poor governance and personalization of structures (around the president);

- False vocations (or even sometimes false associations), created with the sole objective 
of benefiting young people through employment schemes; 
- Insufficient proximity to the ground and populations; 
- Atomization, rivalry and rudimentary collaboration between organizations; 
- Lack of an institutional framework for collaboration between state actors and civil 
society organizations. 
Among the most active associations in the field of food sovereignty, we can mention: 
- The Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights. Created in 2011, the FTDES works 
on the following themes: labor law, women's rights, environmental rights, and migrants' 
rights. With four regional sections, this forum has been working for almost two years to 
facilitate the structuring of popular movements. To this end, it organizes each year a 
"Congress of Social Movements", and publishes a monthly report on the state of freedoms 
in Tunisia as well as an annual report of social movements and other studies on current 
issues. 
- The Observatory of Food Sovereignty and Environment: this association has as its 
general objectives the development of research, information, awareness, and training. In 
2016, the Observatory organized in Tunis a first "Forum for Food Sovereignty" which 
brought together about fifty people. In 2017, it participated in the creation of the “North 
African Food Sovereignty Network” that brings together nine North African organizations 
with an anti-capitalist orientation60 and aims in particular, to "federate" all associations, 
popular organizations, trade unions and social movements of anti-capitalist and anti-
extractivist tendencies61. 
- The Tunisian Permaculture Association: launched in 2013, this association aims to 
promote permaculture culture; master permaculture techniques through the 
organization of workshops; the creation of collaborative projects; the strengthening of 
projects of Tunisian permaculteurs and the discovery of local, ancient or rare species and 
seeds and their conservation. In addition to the training workshops and in partnership 
with the Genebank, this association also organizes an annual farmers' seed festival. 
Having been created after 2011, these associations lack the resources to be able to 
promote and support strong social movements. The president of the Observatory of Food 
Sovereignty and Environment states "Regionalist conflicts, every man for himself within 
the different movements, the lack of a common conscience have prevented mobilizations 
from taking hold and the social question from becoming central after the revolution". 
However, the most interesting experience comes from Jemna:

Box 1: Jemna: is the social and solidarity economy the solution? 
The day after Ben Ali's flight (January 12, 2011), about a hundred inhabitants of the city of 
Jemna in southwest Tunisia seized the largest farm in the region that was rented to private 
individuals ("Henchir EL Moamer").  
Created by the settlers, this farm was managed by a public company ("STIL") that went 
bankrupt before being recovered and leased to private individuals known to be close to the Ben 
Ali regime. 
They obtained the operation of the farm for a period of 15 years and for a paltry sum (between 
16,000 and 40,000 Dt depending on the sources) 
It was therefore in the name of revolution and the right of the people to the ancestors' lands 
that the new occupants refused to leave this farm. 
If in the beginning, it was a question of sharing the 185 hectares and 11000 palm trees between 
the occupants, very quickly the idea of a collective farm was born so that the whole village could 
benefit from it. For this purpose, an association (the Jemna Oasis Protection Association) has 
been created. 
A management committee has also been set up, whose members are elected by the city's 
residents. This committee manages the affairs of the Oasis in a participatory and transparent 
manner. Major decisions (including the sale of the harvest) are made in the middle of the village, 
in the public square and adopted by a majority of votes. 
Very quickly, an arm-wrestling match was set up with the local authorities. The Tunisian State 
could not accept such a situation, which risks spreading to other lands also occupied by 
populations, either in the name of the revolution, or the fight against unemployment, the misuse 
by the State or the private sector, or even in the name of the legitimacy of taking back what 
would have belonged to the ancestors.  
The association for the protection of the Jemna Oasis has thus been accused of taking advantage 
of the revolutionary situation to flout State authority by illegally exploiting a public good. Some 
even saw it as a no-go zone favorable to money laundering and all kinds of trafficking. It has 
also been accused of being politically manipulated (or recovered) and lacking transparency 
(although this could be linked to ongoing negotiations with the state). 
For the time being, and in economic and social terms, the Jemna experience seems to be a 
success. The crops are sold at 1.8 million dinars and the association has been able to develop 
many social projects for the city while resisting the strong political polarization that 
characterizes Tunisia after 2011. 
According to Kerrou (2017) "Despite the obstacles raised against their experience, the 
members of the Association for the Protection of the Oases of Jemna have succeeded in 
revitalizing the city and maintaining cordial and transparent relations among themselves and 
with the national and international support network. Jemna has thus become a symbol of civil 
society's resistance to state authoritarianism and clientelism. »  
One of the outcomes of the battle between the State and the association that manages the farm 
could be that it becomes an SMVDA. In 2017, the Ministry of Agriculture proposed to create a 
cooperative agricultural production unit (under the 1995 Law) to be managed, for a transitional 

34 
 
period, by the Association for the Protection of the Jemna Oases. Although it could save the face 
of the State and safeguard the interests of local populations, this proposal has still not been 
implemented.   
The definitive solution to the legal and political problem posed by the Jemna experience could 
come from the adoption of a new law on the social and solidarity economy (currently under 
discussion).  
For the time being, three challenges must be met if this experience is to make a 
definitive and lasting contribution to true food sovereignty: 
 Legal coverage should be given to a largely popular action, considered legitimate 
because it has done justice to local populations and has had a largely positive 
impact on the inhabitants of the region; 
 Diversify production so that it is no longer dependent on date exports, 
international markets and to better meet the food needs of local populations; 
 Change production and power relations, and redefine work organization 
methods within the farm itself to adopt more democratic and less traditional 
methods of internal management.  
 
b- Agricultural Development Groups (GDA) 
Created following the 1999 framework law, GDAs are non-profit associations generally 
located in rural areas whose mission is to safeguard natural resources and rationalize 
their use.  
In 2011, the number of GDAs was estimated at 2742 for 526830 members, including 1267 
drinking water agricultural development groups, 1243 irrigation agricultural 
development groups and 232 agricultural development groups and fisheries development 
groups62. 
The GDAs for access to drinking water manage about 1000 water points and thus 
contribute to the supply of 232,000 rural families, equivalent to 1,600,000 inhabitants or 
50% of the rural area in Tunisia (Ministry of Agriculture, 2012). 
Generally considered as a propaganda tool of the former political regime, the GDAs have 
several weaknesses (Kalboussi, 2015; Abidi, 201663): 
- The absence of adequate training and support mechanisms for their development. For 
instance, GDAs lack the skills and capacity to carry out maintenance work on drinking 
water access systems. 
- The large volume of their debts (particularly to STEG and CRDAs). According to the 
World Bank, in 2018 out of 1253 GDAs, only 20% are considered functional with a cost 
recovery rate above 60%. Unlike drinking water GDAs, beneficiaries of irrigation GDA

services are required to pay for water before it is consumed. This explains why the former 
are much more indebted than the latter. In addition, some farmers pay GDA members in 
cash and they do not transfer the money to their structure's account. As a result, while the 
water paid for and consumed is not included in the GDA's revenues, but STEG's bill is 
increasing64. 
- The irregularity of the audit of their finances: The Ministry of Finance do not have 
sufficient resources and staff to carry out the financial audit of the GDAs on the spot, and 
it cannot force them to voluntarily report for the audit of their finances. Moreover, 
financial control is limited to checking the balance of the accounts, without looking in 
detail at the conformity of expenditure with the missions of the GDAs. 
- Poor governance: Boards of directors are often subject to family and political 
considerations. In addition, the policy is to change the managers of the GDAs whenever it 
appears that the elders are unable to manage. The formers are therefore not in any way 
concerned when the result of their management. 
- Bureaucracy and lack of autonomy: agricultural development groups are under the 
supervision of two ministries: the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources and the 
Ministry of the Interior through the Governor. While the latter is devoted to controlling, 
the support of the Ministry of Agriculture is weak. 
- The existence of corrupt practices within some GDAs. For instance, there is no 
standardization of water meters, frequent connections without putting the meter on and 
refusal to pay SONEDE and STEG for its consumption. 
c- Mutual Agricultural Service Companies (SMSA) 
Created in 2005 as part of the restructuring of professional agricultural organizations, 
SMSA's mission is to provide services to "farmer" members in order to upgrade 
agricultural production and improve production management.  
SMSAs are founded on several principles (free membership, democratic governance 
based on the principle of "one man one vote" and annual distribution of management 
surpluses to all members) and provide services such as the purchase of raw materials or 
inputs, collection, processing, and marketing. Currently, there are 177 Mutual Agricultural 
Service Companies (SMSAs). 
SMSAs face several problems (Abidi, 2016; ITES, 2017; MedESS, 2017): 
- Low coverage of Farmers (no more than 5% of all farmers) and concentration in the 
coastal regions (64%), 
- Concentration of activities in the dairy sector: 61 SMSAs are engaged in milk collection 
activities, while the three main SMSAs involved in cereal collection have been in a 
"bankruptcy" situation for more than ten years (ITES, 2016)65 because of rigidity of the 
                                                             
64 A recent World Bank report (2018) states that only 20% of GDAs are considered functional with a cost recovery 
rate above 60%.

statutes, highly dependent management of the Grains Board, debt, insufficient 
investments and lack of farmer confidence (Rastoin, Benabderrazik, 2014)66 . 
- Problems of decision-making autonomy: SMSAs are subject to triple supervision (the 
Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Finance). A control 
logic seems to replace other forms of cooperation (training and extension logic), 
- Financing problems (26 SMSAs suffer from survival difficulties, 21 of which have 
abandoned their operations; debt of mutual companies providing central agricultural 
services is estimated at 400 million dinars). The financial contributions of members to the 
incorporation capital of companies remain low. Their access to bank financing is 
hampered by the difficulties of providing guarantees and there is no credit line for SMSAs 
with public banks; 
- Management and skills issues and lack of abilities to carry out technical or management 
work: of the 165 mutual basic agricultural service companies, only 29 have internal 
regulations. 
- Limitation of the scope of activities of SMSAs to the provision of services (in order to 
deal with the fragmentation of agricultural holdings and the lack of technical and financial 
resources of small and medium-sized farmers, it would be appropriate to create mutual 
agricultural production companies (Smpa)), 
- Image problems: there is a lack of trust in the boards of directors of mutual companies 
and SMSAs have difficulty benefiting from the subsidies provided for in the legislative 
texts. 
- Internal governance issues: there is no eligibility criteria for restrictive boards of 
directors; Poor communication between members and the executive board; Poor 
understanding of laws and legal frameworks for farmers; failure to respect the regular 
holding of general meetings. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This work began with an analysis of the current situation of Tunisian agriculture and the 
anchoring of the food issue in Tunisian legislation. 
We have thus been able to show that Tunisian agriculture has been successful in catching 
up with world averages and that it has developed a resilience that has enabled Tunisia to 
cushion the political and institutional upheavals that followed the end of Ben Ali's regime. 
We also showed the fragility of the results achieved and the precariousness into which 
Tunisian agriculture has plunged. 
Secondly, this work presented food security as a necessary but not sufficient condition for 
food sovereignty. We thus gave an overview of the main challenges that Tunisia must face 
in order to reconcile food security and sovereignty.

In a third and final section, we analyzed the transition from the imperative of security to 
that of food sovereignty. We discussed the limits of the neoliberal analysis of food security, 
presented elements of the food sovereignty question in the Tunisian context and brought 
this issue in line with the evolution of the Tunisian State's roles. Finally, we discussed the 
role of the various actors of the food sovereignty movement in Tunisia. 
Conceptually, our work has developed the following hypotheses: 
- Food security brings essential elements to the analysis of the sovereignty issue, but as 
Schanbacher (2010) states, "The food security model has failed both on its own terms 
with respect to its goal to feed the world's hungry and malnourished, and with respect to 
the radicality of its goals. This failure is part and parcel of a dominant neoliberal model of 
globalization that divides humanity, destroys lives and the environment, and insists that 
this is a desirable state of affairs." 
- Food sovereignty is inseparable from national sovereignty and therefore from a certain 
idea of the Nation, its power, the social contract that binds its components, and its 
integration into its geopolitical environment. While globalization and neoliberalism 
convey the idea that it is necessary to sacrifice sovereignty in order to achieve security, 
there can be no sovereignty without security for all. 
- Just as national food security is necessary but not enough to ensure individual food 
security, national sovereignty requires that of individuals and local populations: a nation 
cannot be sustainably sovereign if it does not develop the autonomy, freedom and in a 
way the "sovereignty" of its populations and citizens. 
- The question of food sovereignty refers to a configuration of tensions and conflicting 
relationships between several understandings of sovereignty and security at different 
levels and for different actors. The sovereignty system is a consequence of the dynamic 
equilibrium that results from these conflicts. 
In Tunisia, the fall of the Ben Ali regime and the democratization of the political field have 
boosted civil society and given people new means of pressure. But at the national level, 
political instability, economic crisis, and growing debt constitute the backdrop to the 
growing intervention of international institutions and even foreign chancery in Tunisian 
internal affairs.  
As it takes hold, the crisis leads both to a weakening of the State's negotiating capacities 
and a race towards eroding comparative advantages that are pushing the country into its 
rigidities. A real vicious circle that primarily traps the poorest and most vulnerable. They 
are generally the least able to redeploy and the least flexible in terms of behavior. Unable 
to adapt, farmers and peasants prefer to leave their fields and try to retrain as workers. 
Farmers and peasants who hardly vote, are unable to organize politically and are poorly 
represented in civil society, are than becoming more and more precarious. 
This work has also shown that if agriculture has been one of the most resilient sectors of 
the Tunisian economy, it is at the cost of impoverishing and increasing the precariousness 
of rural areas. Agricultural policy was thus confused with a social policy whose objectives 
are contradictory: on the one hand, to combat poverty and regional imbalances and, on 

38 
 
the other, to make agriculture a component of a social policy favorable to the urbanized 
middle classes.  
Some issues (including climate change) require coordinated policies between nations. 
Without leading to a new form of post-national sovereignty, it seems to us those types of 
coordination for both supra- and infra-national sovereignty are needed. 
The complexity of the issue of food sovereignty and its articulation with that of security, 
as well as the multidimensionality of agricultural problems and their economic, social and 
environmental ramifications, require non-linear, non-binary and non-exclusive 
approaches. These approaches, must take into account the tensions between a priori 
contradictory logic and levels of activity. Indeed, developing sovereignty is as much a 
technical matter as it is a political and cultural one. Similarly, it should be possible to think 
of the tensions between the global, national and local levels; the parts of the national food 
security and sovereignty system and the whole; the coordination between interests as 
well as the contradictions they can convey; conservation in the name of identity, tradition 
or resource preservation and change that can result from innovation, imitation or 
adaptation. 
Habib Ayed states that "If the «phantasm» of food self-sufficiency is based on an 
unrealistic assumption at best «dreamy» and at worst «dogmatic» and irresponsible, real 
food sovereignty is not only a goal and an «objective possibility” but also a condition for 
total political sovereignty. To do this, we must dare the "impossible" and opt for a real 
agrarian, hydraulic and ecological reform". Among the reforms he proposes, we quote67:  
 Do not hesitate to tax imports of agricultural and food products that compete with 
local products as well as exports of agricultural products that consume large 
quantities of water resources; 
 Increase the level of Taxes on pesticides and chemicals used in agricultural 
production; 
 Set a very high price for groundwater (soundings and wells) or surface water 
(dams, lakes, rivers) intended to irrigate production to be exported; 
 Impose an effective minimum wage on agricultural work, prohibit the employment 
of young children and protect women in paid agricultural work (seasonal or 
permanent) from all forms of exploitation and harassment; 
 Subsidize local agricultural products whose production costs are too high; 
 Protect natural resources and safeguard biodiversity 
 Set a minimum and maximum size for private farms 
Among other recommendations aimed at improving food sovereignty in Tunisia, we can 
mention:

- Establish programs to inform the population, train farmers and those responsible for 
supervising them in order to avoid extreme situations of denial of the dangers to 
sovereignty and panic in the face of poorly negotiated and prepared crises. These 
programs would make it possible to act at the right time on strategic variables for 
Tunisia's sovereignty and food security; 
- Establish institutions capable of better coordinating the actions of the various 
stakeholders, reconciling the interests involved and, above all, defending those of future 
generations. A national council on food security and sovereignty supported by an agency 
with an observatory on food security and sovereignty and regional branches could 
provide coherence and evaluate the action of institutions under the supervision of 
different ministries; 
- Develop comprehensive food security and sovereignty strategy to provide a clear vision, 
means, and objectives for all stakeholders (including NGOs, public authorities and the 
private sector); 
- Network citizen movements and civil society actors by developing a national platform of 
civil society organizations, organizing meetings of social movements and exploiting new 
information technologies; 
- Adopt new legislative texts to give concrete expression to constitutional choices (in 
particular the creation of the body dedicated to future generations and a law on the 
circular economy in addition to that on the social and solidarity economy); 
- Launch a specific program of assistance and support for farmers and small farmers and 
use fiscal leverage and public subsidies to better encourage farmers to work together, 
share their resources and means of production and group together in collectives; 
- Reform social intervention instruments so that only those who deserve it benefit; 
- Radically reform the status of the GDAs; 
- Monitor the uncontrolled exploitation of underground water resources and set up a 
national program to combat water waste (in particular by SONEDE) 
- Restructure and empower the Genebank so that it can better defend Tunisia's genetic 
heritage and better control the quality of inputs imported into Tunisia.

1. Agriculture Heritage in India 
Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS), as defined by the FAO (Food 
and Agriculture Organization of the UNO), are: "Remarkable land use systems and landscapes 
which are rich in globally significant biological diversity evolving from the co-adaptation of a 
community with its environment and its needs and aspirations for sustainable development".[1] 
Worldwide, specific agricultural systems and landscapes have been created, shaped and 
maintained by generations of farmers and herders based on diverse natural resources, using 
locally adapted management practices. Building on local knowledge and experience, these 
ingenious agri-cultural systems reflect the evolution of humankind, the diversity of its 
knowledge, and its profound relationship with nature. These systems have resulted not only in 
outstanding landscapes, maintenance and adaptation of globally significant agricultural 
biodiversity, indigenous knowledge systems and resilient ecosystems, but, above all, in the 
sustained provision of multiple goods and services, food and livelihood security for millions of 
local community members and indigenous peoples, well beyond their borders. 
For millennia communities of farmers, herders, fishers and forest people have developed 
complex, diverse, and locally adapted agricultural systems. These systems have been managed 
with time-tested, ingenious combinations of techniques and practices that have usually led to 
community food security, and the conservation of natural resources and biodiversity. Agricultural 
heritage systems can still be found throughout the world covering about 5 million hectares, 
which provide a vital combination of social, cultural, ecological and economical services to 
humankind. These “Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems-GIAHS” have resulted not 
only in outstanding landscapes of aesthetic beauty, maintenance of globally significant 
agricultural biodiversity, resilient ecosystems and a valuable cultural heritage Above all these 
systems sustainabley provide multiple goods and services, food and livelihood security for 
millions of poor and small farmers. The existence of numerous GIAHS around the world testifies 
to the inventiveness and ingenuity of people in their use and management of the finite 
resources, biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics, and ingenious use of physical attributes of the 
landscape, codified in traditional but evolving knowledge, practices and technologies. Whether 
recognized or not by the scientific community, these ancestral agricultural systems constitute 
the foundation for contemporary and future agricultural innovations and technologies. Their 
cultural, ecological and agricultural diversity is still evident in many parts of the world, 
maintained as unique systems of agriculture. Through a remarkable process of co-evolution of

Humankind and Nature, GIAHS have emerged over centuries of cultural and biological 
interactions and synergies, representing the accumulated experiences of rural peoples. 
Indian Agriculture 
Indian agriculture began by 9000 BCE as a result of early cultivation of plants, and 
domestication of crops and animals.[2] Settled life soon followed with implements and 
techniques being developed for agriculture.[3][4] Double monsoons led to two harvests being 
reaped in one year.[5] Indian products soon reached the world via existing trading networks and 
foreign crops were introduced to India.[5][6] 
Plants and animals—considered essential 
to their survival by the Indians—came to be 
worshiped and venerated.[7] 
The middle ages saw irrigation channels 
reach a new level of sophistication in India 
and Indian crops affecting the economies of 
other regions of the world under Islamic 
patronage.[8][9] 
Land 
and 
water 
management systems were developed with 
an aim of providing uniform growth.[10][11] 
Despite some stagnation during the later modern era the independent Republic of India was 
able to develop a comprehensive agricultural program. 
 
Agriculture Heritage in India 
 
Our heritage is unique than any other civilization. As a citizen of India, we must feel 
proud about our rich cultural heritage. Agriculture in India is not of recent origin, but has a long 
history dating back to Neolithic age of 7500-4000 B.C. It changed the life style of early man from 
nomadic hunter of wild berries and roots to cultivator of land. Agriculture is benefited from the 
wisdom and teachings of great saints. The wisdom gained and practices adopted have been 
passed down through generations. The traditional farmers have developed the nature friendly 
farming systems and practices such as mixed farming, mixed cropping, crop rotation etc. The 
Grand Anicut Dam on river Caveri (1st-2nd Century
CE) is one of the oldest water-regulation structures in 
the world still in use.

great epics of ancient India convey the depth of knowledge possessed by the older generations 
of the farmers of India. 
Need and importance for studying Agricultural Heritage  
Our agriculture has lot of inherited sustainable practices passed from one generation to 
other generation. And also agriculture in India is not an occupation; it is a way of life for many 
Indian populations. Hence the present day generation should be aware about our ancient and 
traditional agricultural systems and practices. This will enable us to build the future research 
strategy also.  
India has made tremendous progress in agriculture and its allied fields, but the emphasis 
on intensive use of inputs without considering their adverse impact of long term basis has 
created several problems related to sustainability of agriculture. Irrational use of chemical 
fertilizers, insecticides and exploration of natural resources is threatening the agro eco systems. 
Soil is getting impoverished, water and air getting polluted and there is an increasing erosion of 
plant and animal genetic resources. Therefore, attention in now shifting to sustainable form of 
agriculture.  
 
The indigenous technical knowledge (ITK) provides insight into the sustainable agriculture, 
because these innovations have been carried on from one generation to another as a family 
technology. There are several examples of valuable traditional technologies in India but 
unfortunately these small local systems are dying out. It is imperative that we collect, document 
and analyze these technologies so that the scientific principle/basis behind them could be 
properly understood. Once this done, it will be easier for us to further refine and upgrade them 
by blending them with the modern scientific technology.

Formation of Indian – sub continent 
 
Pangaea, the super-continent 
5
Introductory Agriculture
www.AgriMoon.Com

 
250 millions years ago the Earth's seven continents were all grouped together into a 
super continent (one huge landmass) called ‘Pangaea’. This huge super continent was 
surrounded by one gigantic ocean called Panthalassa.  
Laurasia 
 
About 180 million years ago the super continent Pangaea began to break up in the 
Mesozoic Era into Laurasia and Gondwanaland. Laurasia was made of the present day 
continents of North America (Greenland), Europe, Angara land (Asia) comprising Russia, 
Siberia and China in the north. Gondwanaland was made of the present day continents of 
South America, Africa, India, Australia, and Antarctica. At this time India was not connected to 
Asia. The huge ocean of Panthalasa remained. 
 
 
‘The Triple Junction’ was formed because of a three-way split in the crust allowing 
massive lava flows in three directions and poured out lava over hundreds of square miles of 
Africa and South America. The rocks in these two continents were produced at the same time 
and in the same place. This tells us that South America and Africa were connected at one time. 
Today these two continents are separated by the Atlantic Ocean which is over 2000 miles wide. 
 
Laurasia was still moving, and as it moved it broke up into the continents of North 
America, Europe and Asia (Eurasian plate). In the second stage, the Gondwanan continents 
separated from each other during the Jurassic and Cretaceous period. In the late Jurassic, 
South America separated from Africa. This created another narrow basin between these two 
continents. The eastern coast of North America separated from the Moroccan bulge of Africa. 
The breakup of the Gondwanaland opened up the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean.  
 
 
The Indian Subcontinent moved hundreds of miles in 135 million years at a great speed 
(4 inches per year). The Indian plate crashed into the Eurasian plate (Asia)  with such speed

and force that it created the tallest mountain range on Earth, the Himalayas. The Tethys was 
being squeezed out of existence in the east of the Alpines as India approached Asia. 
 
 
Physical geography of Indian sub-continent 
 
 
The most outstanding fact about the physical geography of India is the natural division of 
the country with three distinct segments of totally dissimilar character: (i) the Himalayas, the 
great mountain system to the north, (ii) the Indo-Gangetic alluvial plain of northern India 
extending from the Punjab to Assam, and (iii) the Peninsula of the Deccan to the south of the 
Vindhyas-a solid stable block of the earth's crust, largely composed of some of the most ancient 
rocks, which the denudation of ages has carved into a number of mountain ranges, plateaus, 
valleys and plains.

2. DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN CULTURE AND BEGINNING OF AGRICULTURE 
Development of human culture  
It is supposed that man was evolved on earth about 15 lakh years ago. This man was 
evolved from the monkey who started to move by standing erect on his feet. Such man has 
been called Homo erectus (or) Java man. Later on Java man transformed into Cro-Magnon and 
Cro-Magnon into modern man. The modern man is zoologically known as Homo sapiens (Homo 
- Continuous, Sapiens - learning habit). In the beginning such man had been spending his life 
wildly, but during the period 8700-7700 BC, they started to pet sheep and goat, although the 
first pet animal was dog, which was used for hunting.  
The history of agriculture and civilization go hand in hand as the food production made it 
possible for primitive man to settle down in selected areas leading to formation of society and 
initiation of civilization. The development of civilization and agriculture had passed through 
several stages. Archeologist initially classified the stages as stone age, Bronze and Iron age. 
Subsequently the scholars spilt up the stone age into Paleolithic period (old stone age), 
Neolithic age (New stone age) and Mesolithic age (Middle stone age).  
Each of three ages, saw distinct improvements. The man fashioned and improved tools 
out of stones, bones, woods etc. to help them in day-to-day life. They started growing food 
crops and domesticated animals like cow, sheep, goat, dog etc.  
Paleolithic age (old stone age)  
This period is characterized by the food gatherers and hunters. The stone age man 
started making stone tools and crude choppers.  
Mesolithic period  
The transitional period between the end of the Paleolithic and beginning of the Neolithic is 
called Mesolithic. It began about 10000BC and ended with the rise of agriculture. This period is 
8
Introductory Agriculture
www.AgriMoon.Com

characterized by tiny stone implements called microliths. People lived as food gatherers and 
hunters. The domestication of the dog was the major achievement of the Mesolithic hunter.  
Neolithic Agricultural Revolution (7500 BC - 6500 BC)  
Neolithic revolution brought a major change in the techniques of food production which 
gave man control over his environment and saved him from the precarious existence of mere 
hunting and gathering of wild berries and roots. For the first time, he lived in settled villages and 
apart from security from hunger he had leisure time to think and contemplate.  
The main features of Neolithic culture in India  
1. Neolithic culture denotes a stage in economic and technological   development in  
    India  
2. Use of polished stone axes for cleaning the bushes  
3. Hand made pottery for storing food grains  
4. Invented textile, weaving and basketry  
5. Cultivation of rice, banana sequence and yams in eastern parts   of India  
6. Cultivation of millets and pulses in south India  
7. Discovery of silk  
Chalcolithic culture (Bronze age) (3000-1700 BC): 
The term Chalcolithic is applied to communities using stone implements along with copper 
and bronze. In more advanced communities, the proportion of copper and bronze implements is 
higher than that of stones. The chalcolithic revolution began in Mesopotamia in the fourth 
millennium B.C. from this area it spread to Egypt, and Indus valley.  
The significant features are  
1. Invention of plough  
2. Agriculture shifted from hilly area to lower river valley  
9
Introductory Agriculture
www.AgriMoon.Com

3. Flood water were stored for irrigation and canals were dug  
4. Irrigated farming started in this period  
5. Sowing of seed by dibbling with a pointed stick  
6. Salinity problem and water logging were noticed due to canal irrigation.

 Harappans not only grew cotton but also devised methods for ginning / spinning / 
weaving. 
 
4000 to 2000years ago 
 In North Arcot, bone / stone tools were found.  
 In Nevasa (Maharastra), copper and polished stone axes were used. First evidence of 
the presence of silk was found at this location.

imported by Romans.  
 Chola King Karikala (190 AD) defeated Cheras and Pandyas, invaded Srilanka, captured 
12000 men and used them as slaves to construct an embankment along the Cauvery, 
160km along, to protect land from floods. He has built numerous irrigation tanks and 
promoted agriculture by clearing forests.  
 
1500-1000 years ago 
The Kanauj Empireof Harshavardhana (606-647 AD) 
 Cereals such as wheat, rice and millets, and fruits were extensively grown. A 60-day

3 . INDUS CIVILIZATION (3250 BC - 2750 BC) 
In the year 1922, archaeologists dug up a few places in the Indus valley and carried out 
excavations at Mohenjodara (meaning a mound of dead) in Sind (in Pakistan) and at Harappa 
on the river Ravi in Punjab. They found traces of a very ancient civilization, which flourished 
more than five thousand years ago. They 
observed that the people utilized the pots, 
utensils and ornaments. These cities were 
built along the river Indus and hence this 
civilization 
is 
known 
as 
Indus 
valley 
civilization. It is also known as Harappan 
culture and occupied the areas stretching from Delhi to Gujarat.  
During this period the people identified the importance of ploughing for the proper sowing 
of crop (i.e) soil has to be stirred and seed has to be covered. Ox-drawn wheel cart was used 
for transport. The people cultivated wheat, barley, gram, peas, sesamum and rape. They also 
cultivated cotton and also devised methods of ginning, spinning and weaving. Animal 
nusbandary was also given more importance during this period. They domesticated buffalo, 
cattle, camel, horse, elephant, ass and birds. They utilized them in agriculture and also for 
transport.  
The most remarkable discovery in Harappa is the Great Granary used for storing food 
grain. These grannaries, each 50x20 feet overall, are arranged symmetrically in two rows of six 
in each row with central passage and 23 feet wide. From the size of the granary it can be 
concluded that the peasants paid their dues to the Government in kind, used the kinds in 
granary for payments to employees. The artisans, carpenters and others received their wages in 
kind from the farmers.

The Vedic civilization  
The word “Veda” is derived from “Vid” which means “Knowledge” Veda is the only literary 
source from which we know about the Aryans in India. Aryans were more prevalent during Vedic 
time which extends from Eastern Afghanistan, Kashmir, Punjab and Parts of Sind and 
Rajasthan. The land of Aryans was called land of seven rivers i.e., (Satlaj, Beas, Ravi, 
Chennab, Jhelum, Indus and Saraswathi). The Rig-veda was the oldest book of Aryans.  
Pastoralism  
The Vedic Aryans were primarily pastrol. When they settled in the Punjab, they cut the 
jungles and built their villages. They grazed the animals in jungles and cultivated barley near the 
houses to protect from wild animals.  
Vedic people realized the importance of off-season ploughing and they started ploughing 
as and when the rain was received. The first ploughing of the season was inaugurated amidst 
much ritual. The plough used was large and heavy. Bullocks and ox were used for ploughing. 
With regard to irrigation, channels were dug from the rivers.Wells were in use for supply of 
drinking water and irrigation called kucha wells, which were just holes dug in the ground. Even 
now such wells are in use in the river rain areas of northern India.  
Crops cultivated in Vedic period  
In early Vedic period there is no mention of rice and cotton though they were cultivated in 
Harappa period. In the later Vedic period (1000 - 600 BC) agricultural implements were 
improved and iron ploughshare also improved. The people possessed the knowledge of fertility 
of land, selection of seed, seedtreatment, harvesting, manuring and rotation of crops. Barley 
sesame and sugarcane were the main crops. Cucumber and bottle gourd were also mentioned 
in Vedic period, Aryans were accustomed to barley diet. Barley is good for men, cattle and 
horses. Barley is used in Hindu rituals even today. For cloths, wool and cotton were used.  
The agriculture implements mentioned in vedic literature include the plough (langala - a

lase pointed type having smooth handle, Sira - a large and heavy plough).Sickle was used for 
harvesting and sieves were used for cleaning.  
 
Civilizations in other parts of World 
LEMURIA CIVILIZATION 
Lemuria was originally the name given to a vast hypothetical sunken continent or a land-bridge 
or landmass stretching from Ceylon to Madagascar all the way to the central Pacific Ocean 
across the Indian Ocean and Indonesia. Ancient Lemuria-map of India in 30,000 B.C. The 
lemurs derive their name from that of the Lemurs (or "Ancestors"). Man descends from the 
apes. Hence, the name of Lemuria can be interpreted as "Land Ancestral" or "Land of the 
Ancestors". The ancient land tying India and Australia together that sank incrementally over 
time, is referred to as ‘Lemuria’.  The Tamil bark writings in Southern India tell of the gigantic 
Southern part of India, which used to connect to Australia cataclysmically sinking incrementally 
over a long period of time. This was ancient Lemuria or Kumari Kandam. The great flood would 
have sunk Lemuria or Kumari Kandam before the Ramayana period (10,000 BC).

4. Status of farmers in the society during Indus, Vedic, Buddhist, Mauryan, Gupta and 
Sangam periods 
 
Harappan period: 
 
The Indus Civilization had the first farming cultures in South Asia, which emerged in the 
hills of what is now called Baluchistan, to the west of the Indus Valley. The farmers took part in 
the so-called Neolithic Revolution, which took place in the Fertile Crescent around 9000 to 6000 
BCE. These early farmers domesticated wheat and a variety of animals, including cattle. In the 
"Era" terminology, the Neolithic is known as the "Early Food Producing Era". 
 
Early Harappan 
The development of these farming communities ultimately led to the formation of larger 
settlements from the later 4th millennium. Indus valley civilization was composite product of 
different races who lived and worked together in a particular environment. Mohenjo daro had 
easy land and water communication; it was the meeting ground of people for different parts of 
Asia. Farmers had, by this time, domesticated numerous crops, including peas, sesame seeds, 
dates and cotton, as well as a wide range of domestic animals, including the water buffalo. 
Late Harappan 
By 2500 BCE, the Early Harappan communities had been turned into urban centers. Thus far, 
six such urban centers have been discovered, including: Harappa, Mohenjo Daro and Dicki in 
Pakistan, along with Gonorreala, Dokalingam and Mangalore in India. In total, over 1052 cities 
and settlements have been found, mainly in the general region of the Ghaggar-Florence River 
and its tributaries. By 2500 BCE, irrigation had transformed the region. 
Vedic period: 
16
Introductory Agriculture

                 The most important people of the Vedic period are Vaishnava. There are four Vedic 
periods viz., Rig, Sama, Yajur, and Atharvana Vedas. In Rig Vedas period, the farmers 
occupied more number in the society. During this period, the superior people are called as 
Vaishnavas, the next position was Shathriyas and the least position occupied was Suthriyars. 
The Suthriyars are the farmers they cultivated the land and produced agricultural products 
under the land lord.  
The farmers status was more in Atharva Vedic period. They cultivated the crops based on the 
advice of the saints.   
 
Buddhist period: 
           A food producing economy emerged with the practice of agriculture on a wide scale by 
using iron implements. There was pleasant proprietorship in rural areas and there were no land 
lords. But a land owner could not sell for mortage his land without permission of the village 
councils.  
       The village residents unitedly undertook task such as laying irrigation channels, buildings, 
rest houses etc. the women extended their full co operation in their works (public utility). He 
whole of each village was self sufficient, life was simple.  
 
Mauryan period: 
                  The economy was agrarian, majority of population were agriculturists. People were 
also engaged in animal husbandry and cattle rearing which meant additional income to 
peasants and the state. Gaha pathi were the term used for head of rich land owing family.  
 
Gupta period: 
                    The cultivators were called by various terms called Krishihala or Kinars. They had 
low social and economic life.  
17

Sangam period: 
                   During Sangam literature, agriculture was the main occupation and hence the 
position of the farmers in the society was also high during this period.  
                    Agriculture Sangam was developed in Madurai. The farmers are called uzhavar 
(plough man) and also they are called as Kalmar. The land owners called superior vellars and 
the farmers who plough the land are called as inferior vellars. 
The farmers’ status was mainly determined by the holding of land and animal population.  
 
Thirukural period: 
       Thiruvalluvar mentioned about importance of farmers in the society. In his statement, 
       
      “Farmers alone live an independent life. Others worship them and are second to         
        them”       
      “If farmers stop cultivation, even Rishis (sages) can not survive”

5. KAUTILYA’S ARTHA-SASTRA, AGRICULTURE, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY, COMMODITY 
TRADE etc. – FEATURES OF VILLAGE 
 
Kautilya (also known as Vishnugupta or Chanakya) (321-296 BC) was a great scholar of 
time. He wrote a treatise titled, Artha-sastra, which deals with the management of resources. 
During Kautilya’s time agriculture, cattle breeding and trade were grouped into a science called 
varta. Kautilya gave great importance to agriculture and suggested a separate post of head of 
agriculture and named it as Sitadhakashya. Agriculture today receives prime importance, by 
policy and administrative support from government officials. eg. i) Supply of good seeds and 
other inputs ii) Provision of irrigation water iii) prediction of rainfall by IMD iv) Assistance in 
purchase of machineries v) Marketing and safe storage. All the important aspects are 
mentioned by kautilya in his book. He suggested many important aspects in agriculture which 
are highly relevant today.  
1. The superintendent of agriculture should be a person who is knowledgeable in agriculture 
and horticulture. There was a   provision to appoint a person who was not an expert but 
he was assisted by other knowledgeable person. This is applicable even   today, 
appointment of the directors of agriculture, horticulture are sometimes civil servants 
assisted by technical persons.  
2. Anticipation of labours by land owners before sowing. Slaves and   prisoners were 
organised to sow the seeds in time. He also   emphasized that thorough ploughing 
provides good soil texture   required for a particular crop. Even today farmers in Punjab 
hire   labours from Bihar at times of heavy demand period.   
3. Timely sowing is very important for high yield particularly for   rainfed sowing for which, all 
the implements and accessories have to be kept ready. Any delay in these 
arrangements received   punitive action.  
19
Introductory Agriculture
www.AgriMoon.Com

4. Kautilya suggested that for getting good yield of rainfed crop, a   rainfall of 16 dronas (one 
drona=40 mm to 50 mm) was essential and 4 dronas rainfall is sufficient for rice. It is 
very   significant to note that rain gauge was used during Kautilya’s period. It was 
apparently a circular vessel (20 fingers   width, 8 fingers width depth) and the unit to 
measure rain was   adhaka (1 adhaka=12 mm approx.)  
5. He also stressed the optimum distribution of rainfall during crop   growing season one 
third of the required quantity of rainfall falls   both in the commencement and closing 
months of rainy season   (July/Aug; October/Dec) and 2/3 of rainfall in the middle 
(August/  Sept.; October) is considered as  very even. This concept is   applicable even 
today i.e. even distribution is essential for rainfed   crop.  
6. The crops should be sown according to the change in the season.   eg. Sali (transplant 
rice), Virlu (direct sown rice), till (Sesame),   millets should be sown at the 
commencement of rain. Pulses to be sown in the middle of season. Safflower, linseed 
mustard, barley, wheat to be sown later. It is clear that even today our   scientific results 
prove that cereals, millets were sown early and oilseeds, wheat, barley require less 
water which could be   sown at last or as post rainy season.  
7. He also stressed that rice crop require less labour expense vegetables are intermediate, 
and sugarcane is worst as it    requires more attention and expenditure. It is true even 
today after 2000 years the situation has never changed that sugarcane   requires heavy 
labour and expenditure.  
8. The crops like cucurbits are well suited to banks of rivers, Long-peper, sugarcane and 
grapes do well where the soil profile is   well charged with water. Vegetable require 
frequent irrigation,   borders of field suited for cultivation of medicinal plants. Even today 
the practice of growing cucurbit (Watermelon,  pumpkin) on river banks continue from 
river Ganges north to Pamba river in south. This is an outstanding example of sustained   
practice, which ensures utilization of moisture available in river   bank.  
20

9. Some of the biocontrol practices suggested by Kautilya has got   relevance even today.  
    They are:  
 a) Practice of exposing seeds to mist and heat for seven nights.  These practices are 
followed even now in wheat to prevent    smut diseases. Soaking of seed in water to 
activate fungal    mycelia and drying the seed under hot sun to kill the fungal.  
 b) Cut ends of sugarcane are plastered with the mixture of    honey, ghee and cowdung. 
Recently evidences proved that    honey has widely an antimicrobial property. Ghee 
could seal     off the cut ends prevent loss of moisture and cowdung    facilitated 
biocontrol of potential pathogens.  
10. He also suggested that harvesting should be done at proper time   and nothing should 
be left in the field not even chaff. The harvested   produce should be properly processed 
and safely stored. The above ground crop residues were also removed from fields and   
fed to cattle.  
Trade and Marketing (Economic policies)  
All the industries were categorized into two groups according to their ownership. One 
group of key industry was covered by state and another group by private.It is interesting to note 
that this policy resembles today’s model mixed economy. The production, distribution and 
consumption of agricultural produces were well controlled by the king. Agriculture was placed in 
the category of privately owned industries. The state Government should control and regulate all 
the economic aspects and evade the influence of market forces and private interests.  
These practices suggested by Kautilya were followed by Indian farmers for over centuries 
which are more sustainable and   relevance to scientific agriculture.

6. AGRICULTURE IN THE SANGAM LITERATURE OF TAMIL NADU 
During the Sangam period (200 BC to 100 AC), the main profession of the population of 
the Tamil region (now Tamil Nadu) was agriculture. The region extended from Cape Comorin in 
the South to Tirupati (in Andhra Pradesh) in the North, parts of present Kerala and Karnataka in 
the West. The methods of cultivation practised during this ancient period were revealed by 
several proverbs, village songs and literature of the period which are available even today. It is 
rather surprising that the people had good knowledge about agriculture (seed varieties, seed 
selection, seed storage, ploughing, manuring, irrigation, weeding, crop protection, pests, and 
botanical pesticides).  
The Sangam period literature covers wide aspects of the people’s life, such as epics, 
ethics, social life, and religion. Several poems composed during this period have been passed 
on from generation to generation through memorizing and chanting and later through 
manuscripts written on palmyara leaves. With the advent of paper and printing machinary, Shri 
Swaminatha Iyer who is popularly called “Tamill grandfather” painstakingly collected them and 
brought them out as printed books. Two peoms of the Sangam period, viz., Tholkappiyam and 
Thirukural, gives us a vivid picture of agricultural practices in that period.  
Tholkappiyam  
The poem Tholkapiyam was written by the poet Tholkappier during 200 BC. It give 
descriptions of various agricultural aspects and these are enumerated below.  
Land classification  
Land was classified into four groups, viz., mullai (forest), Kurinji (hills), marudham 
(cultivable lands), and neithal (coastal areas).  
Seasons  
22
Introductory Agriculture
www.AgriMoon.Com

Six seasons are mentioned: early spring, late spring, cloudy, rainy, early winter, and late 
winter.  
Cultivated crops  
There are references to rice, millets, sugarcane, banana, cardamom, pepper, cotton, 
sesame, coconut, and nut. Farmers were aware that rice could be grown as rainfed crops. 
Banana and sugarcane were ratooned. Plants were considered as living beings and endowed 
with sensitivity. Tholkappier mentions about monocots and dicots 2700 years ago.  
Importance of agriculture  
Kings considered agricultural development as their primary duty. They felt that soil fertility 
and irrigation facilities should be the country’s assets. Increased agricultural production was 
considered a yardstick of prosperity of the country. The stability of a kingdom was ensured not 
by army but by agriculture and sufficient crop production. Failure of monsoon rains and 
reduction in grain yield were attributed to the king’s sins.  
Irrigation  
Kings dug tanks at locations where water flow from rains was plentiful. Semicircular bunds 
were raised adjacent to small hillocks and water reservoirs akin to present day dams were 
raised and constructed. Thus indicates awareness of water harvesting.The king Karikal Cholan 
brought 1000 slaves from a conquered country and raised the bunds of river Cauvery. The 
stone dam constructed across the river Cauvery centuries ago is considered a master piece of 
engineering even today. River water was diverted to tanks through channels. It is mentioned 
that irrigation should be given either in early morning or late evening and not during hot mid-day.  
Agricultural implements  
Buffaloes were used for ploughing with a wooden plough. Deep ploughing was considered 
superior to shallow ploughing. A labour saving tool called parambu was used for levelling paddy 
23

fields. Tools such as amiry, keilar, and yettam were used to lift water from wells, tanks, and 
rivers. Tools called thattai and kavan were used for scaring birds in millet fields. Traps were 
used to catch wild boars in millet fields.  
Seeds  
Seed was selected from those earheads that first matured. The selected seed was stored 
for sowing only and never used as food grain. It was believed that such a diversion would 
destroy the family.  
Crop rotation  
Crop rotation was practised by raising black gram (urd) after rice. This indicates that 
farmers were aware of the benefits to the following rice crop which we now know is due to the 
nitrogen fixation in the root nodules of urd. They also practised mixed cropping; e.g., foxtail 
millet with lablab or cotton. Today we know that a balanced diet should have starch (supplied by 
rice and millets) and protein (supplied by lablab). In coconut and jack fruit plantations, ginger 
and turmeric  were grown as intercrops  
Threshing  
A tool called senyam was used for havesting rice. Threshing of rice was done by hand 
with the help of a buffalo (and in large holdings by elephants). Hand winnowing was done to 
remove chaff. One sixth of the produce was paid as tax to the king. Farm labourers were paid in 
kind.  
The land was immediately ploughed after harvest or water was allowed to the field to 
facilitate rooting of stubbles. These agronomic practices are recommended even today based 
on scientific principles. Operations requiring hard work such as ploughing were done by men 
while women attended to light work such as transplanting, weeding, bird scaring, harvesting, 
and winnowing.  
24
Introductory Agriculture
www.AgriMoon.Com

In Kandapuranam, it is mentioned that Valli, daughter of a king, was sent for bird scaring 
in millet fields where Lord Muruga (son of Lord Shiva) courted her and married.  
Marketing  
Products were exchanged by weight. In Madurai ( the headquarters of Sangam poets), 
there was a food grain bazaar where 18 kinds of cereals, millets, and pulses were sold. Each 
shop had a banner hoisted high so that it could be seen from a distance indicating that the 
grains are sold here. What a novel method instead of neon signals and name boards! Customs 
duty was collected on imports and exports.  
Thirukural  
The poem was composed by a gifted poet named Thiruvalluvar during 70 BC. It consists 
of 1330 couplets (133 topics each having 10 couplets). It is the pride of Sangam Tamil literature 
and its greatness can be realized from the fact that it has been translated into English and 
several other languages. It devotes one topic (10 couplets) for agriculture under the chapter 
politics. This clearly reveals the recognition that the prime duty of a king is to ensure agricultural 
production. Even today we know that Government  fall when people are starved. The French 
revolution 200 years ago can be traced to food shortage leading to the fall of Louis XVI. One of 
the causes of defeat of Germany in World War I was potato shortage due to the late blight 
disease of potato. When the available copper was diverted to meet the army’s requirements, 
production of copper sulphate, lime and water) preparation was affected and late blight could 
not be controlled. The available potato was sent to soldiers fighting in the front. Hence, potato 
was not available to families of soldiers. This severely affected the morale of German 
soldiers.Horsfall and Cooling jocularly mention the story in the following lines:  
For want of a nail, the shoe was lost.  
For want of shoe, the horse was lost.  
For want of horse, the soldier was lost.  
25
Introductory Agriculture

For want of soldier, the war was lost.  
In India also, several state governments have fallen when they failed to ensure adequate 
supply of food grains through public distribution system.  
The importance of agriculture and related aspects are indicated in the following couplets 
and descriptions.  
 Importance of agriculture  
“World spins around many industries. All such industries spin around agriculture.”  
“Farmers alone live an independent life; others worship them and are second to them.”  
“If farmers stop cultivation, even rishis (sages) cannot survive.”  
Ploughing  
“If land is ploughed deep and soil allowed to dry to one fourth weight, even manuring is 
not necessary.”  
Manuring  
“Manuring is more important than ploughing: crop protection is more important than 
irrigation.” Green leaf manuring, farmyard manure, and sheep penning were in vogue though 
farmers were not aware that they supplied nitrogen to the crop. One is amazed at the depth of 
agricultural knowledge our ancestors possessed.  
Irrigation  
Bed method was followed as an efficient method of water management.  
Weeding  
“Just like the farmer pulls out weeds with the root system, so the king should eliminate 
rowdies from society.”  
Care of crops  
26
Introductory Agriculture
www.AgriMoon.Com

“If the farmer does not regularly visit his field, the crop will not grow.”  
The foregoing account of agriculture from ancient Tamil literature clearly indicates the 
agricultural knowledge of our forefathers. By following their footsteps, the present generation of 
agricultural scientists have used the advanced technologies and have tried to stabilize 
agricultural production in our country  to meet our food requirements.

7. Astronomy - Prediction Of  Monsoon Rains; Parashara, Varamihira, Panchanga in 
comparison to modern methods 
 Modern scientific knowledge of methods of weather forecasting have originated recently. 
But ancient indigenous knowledge is unique to our country. India had a glorious scientific and 
technological tradition in the past. A scientific study of meteorology was made by our ancient 
astronomers and astrologers.   Even today, it is common that village astrologers (pandits)are 
right in surprisingly high percentage of their weather predications.  
Meteorology is generally believed to be a new science. It may be  new to the west, but not 
in india, where this science has existed since ancient times. A systematic study of this science 
was made by our  ancient astronomers and astrologers. The rules are simple and costly 
apparatus are not required. Observations coupled with experience over centuries enhanced to 
develop meteorology.  
The ancient/indigenous method of weather forecast may be broadly classified into two 
categories.  
1. Observational method  
 
 
 
-indicators  
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Theoretical methods (or) Astrological factors (or) planetary factors  
 Computation of planetary positions and conjunctions of planets   and stars  
 Study of solar ingress and particular date of months

 Study of Nakshatra Chakras  
 Study of Nadi Chakras  
 Dashatapa Siddhanta  
Alamanacs in Indian astronomy and astrology (Panchangs)  
According to the Encyclopedia Britannica (1969), “An almanac is a book or table 
containing a calendar of the days, weeks and months of the year, a register of ecclesiastical 
festivals and saint’s day and a record of various astronomical phenomena, often with weather 
prognostications and seasonal suggestions for countrymen”.  
In India, the classical Hindu almanac is known as “Panchang’. This book is published 
yearly, and is the basic book of the society giving calendrical information on daily basis and is 
extensively used by the people all over India. For astrologers, it is one of the basic book for 
making astrological calculators, casting horoscopes, and for making predictions. For farmers, it 
is an astrological guide to start any farming activity.  
The word ‘Panchang’ has it’s roots in two Sanskrit words, viz., ‘panch’ and ‘ang’, which 
means ‘five’ and ‘body part/limb’ respectively. These parts are   
1.  Tithi (or) Lunarday - Total of thirty tithis in a lunar month, fifteen   in each fortnight.  
2.  Vara of week day - seven varas, namely  
   
 
Ravivara (Sunday)  
    
 
Somavara (Monday)  
   
 
Mangalavara ( Tuesday)  
    
 
Budhavara (Wednesday)  
    
 
Guruvara ( Thursday)  
    
 
Shukravara (Friday) and   
    
 
Shanivara (Saturday)  
29
Introductory Agriculture

3. Nakshatra (or) asterism (or) constellation - Total of twenty seven   nakshtras named  
   according to the yagataras (or) identifying stars   of each of the twenty seven equal  
   parts of the ecliptic  (or) solar path.  
4.Yoga (or) time during which the joint motion of the sun and the   moon covers the  
   space of the nakshatra (there are twenty seven   yogas).  
5. Karana (or) half of a lunar day (or) half-tithi.  
The other items considered for astrological prediction are  
1. Rashi (or) twelve equal parts of the Zodiac belt, hence twelve   rashis  
2. Planets  
3. Solar months and solar year  
4. Lunar months and lunar year  
5.  Era  
 
Theoretical basis of weather forecasting in ancient literature and panchangs.  
According to Varahamihira and other scholars, the formation of clouds (or) garbhadharana 
takes place 195 days before their birth (or) delivery (or) garbhaprasava. During this period 
clouds were grouped as Abartak (Avartak), Sambartak (Samvartak), Pushkara and Drona. If 
abartak is dominating one year, rain will be received in certain places in that year; if sambartak, 
rain will be received in all of the country;  
If pushkara, the quantity of rain will be very less; and if drona, that year will receive 
abundant rain water.  
It is also true that even today, the cloud classification indicates Circus, Cirrostratus, Cirro 
cumulus, Altostratus, Altocumulus, Stratocumulus, stratus, Nimbo Stratus, Cumulus and 
Cumulonimbus. Among this, Nimbostratus and Cumulonimbus gives rainfall to the earth.  
According to the ruling planet of a year, overall rainfall of that particular year should be

For predicting the monsoon and its subsequent effects on weather, all panchang makers 
consider three different Nadi Siddhantas (Capsular theories) commonly known as Nadi 
charkas. These are:  
1. Dwinadi charka  
2. Trinadi charka  
3. Saptanadi charka

Prediction analysis and discussion  
The analysis indicates that rainfall predictions made in panchangas based on ancient 
astrological theories are, on an average, better  and in some cases at par with the predictions 
made by Govt. meteorological department through modern techniques and procedures.  
(E.g.) The yearly truly corrected predictions of rainfall made during 1946-1995 were 75, 
78, 74 and 75% respectively for different panchangam. The seasonal prediction also indicated 
that it was  89% for summer, 55% for rainy, 90% for winter and 78% for overall.  
 
Method of measurement of rainfall  
The method of measurement of rainfall is described by Varahamihira. A circular vessel 
32
Introductory Agriculture
www.AgriMoon.Com

with a diameter equal to one (human) arm or the distance measured by the width of 20 (human) 
fingers and with  a depth equal to the distance measured by the width of eight fingers should be 
accepted for measurement of rainfall. When this vessel is completely filled with rainwater, the 
rainfall should be equal to 50 palas or one adhaka. This method has been explained by the 
Parashara.  
 
A model for forcasting seasonal rainfall recorded in Brhat Samhita  
Brhat Samhita reveals that even in the sixth century AD, Varahamihira, a resident of 
Malwa (present-day western Madhya Pradesh) faced the problem of uncertainty of monsoon 
rains. The date of onset of such rains could not be predicted and so the amount of rainfall during 
the season was also a gamble. As he was proficient in astrology, he tried to evovle or adapt a 
technique which was based on that science. This technique lays down that after the occurence 
of the full-moon day of the month of Jyestha (approximately coinciding with June of Gregorian 
calendar), the asterism or lunar mansion or nakshatra of the day on which the first rainfall of that 
year’s rainy season is received should be noted. This asterism provided the basis for the 
forecast of seasonal rains (Table ). While giving this forecast, it was also necessary to take into 
account the area over which the first rainfall of the season had occured. There are twenty-seven 
such asterisms or lunar mansions in Indian astrology, with each one falling under a particular 
zodiac sign.

Krishi-Panchang  
The researcher developed the Krishi panchang (or) Agroalmanac (or) Agropanchang. It 
may be defined as basic astro-agricultural guide book/calendar published annually, giving 
calendrical information on various aspects of agricultural and allied activities, basically 
suggesting region wise, seasonwise and cropwise. Crop strategy based on astro-meteorological 
prediction, giving auspicious time for undertaking various farm related operations, along with a 
list for performing religious rites, festivals, observing fasts and some non-astrological agricultural 
guidance, primarily useful for the farming communities and persons having interest in 
agricultural development.  
The contents of the proposed Krishi-Panchang can broadly be categorized into two major 
42
Introductory Agriculture
www.AgriMoon.Com

groups as follows:  
 
1. Information which changes every year  
 Annual date and Holiday calendar  
 Month-wise daily guide for the whole year  
 “Rashiphal”, i.e., month-wise forecasting of persons having   different zodiac signs.  
 Daily/monthly/annual weather forecasting for the particular year  
 Crop prospects of that year based on planetary positions  
 Season-wise crop strategy based on anticipated weather  
 
 
 
2. Information which remains the same irrespective of any particular year  
 Theories relating to agricultural and meteorological forecasting  
 Auspicious moments for agricultural and allied activities  
 Some general agricultural guidance.  
 
Panchang-making  
The content and coverage of the proposed Krishi-Panchang, indicate that only qualified 
astrologers cannot prepare the whole content on their own, rather an editorial board comprising 
of both qualified astrologers and crop specialists can do justice. While preparing the Panchang, 
the editorial board members should keep in mind the following important points :  
 
 The Krishi-Panchang is largely meant for the local farming   communities, having very 
low educational status. Hence, it   must be in the local colloquial  language to facilitate 
43
Introductory Agriculture
www.AgriMoon.Com

reading and  comprehension.  
 Care should be taken to make the Krishi-Panchang easily  understandable and clear in 
its meaning.  
 It should be very comprehensive in its content and coverage  with proven predictive 
information only.  
 It should not contain any astrological details or complexities which   would go beyond the 
understanding capability of our less   educated farmers and agriculturists.  
 It should be attractive in colour, and presentation of information  should be systematic 
according to seasons (kharif, rabi, and   summer) and crops.  
 It must be low-priced/nominal-priced, within the affordable range  of small and marginal 
farmers.  
 More important is, it must be made available to the farmers and  needy persons 
sufficiently in advance, i.e., at least1-2 months  before the start of the agriculture  year 
(july-june)

8. ANCIENT SOIL CLASSIFICATION AND MAINTENANCE OF SOIL PRODUCTIVITY 
SOIL CLASSIFICATION  
In ancient times geographical distribution by Surapala was jangala (arid), anupa (marshy) 
and samanya (ordinary). It is further divided by colour into black, white, pale, dark, red and 
yellow by taste into sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter and astringent. Samanya land was 
suitable for all kinds of trees.  
Rig-veda identified productive and non-productive soils. There were 12 classification 
based on soil fertility, irrigation and physical characteristics. These soil classifications are as 
follows :  
1. Urvara (fertile)  
2. Ushara (barren)  
3. Maru (desert)  
4. Aprahata (fallow)  
5. Shadvala (grassy)  
6. Pankikala (muddy)  
7. Jalaprayah (water)  
8. Kachchaha (land contiguous to water)  
9. Sharkara (full of pebbles)  
10. Sharkaravari (sandy)  
11. Nadimatruka (land water from river)  
12. Devamatruka (rainfed)  
Another classification based on crops suitable  
a. Vrdiheyam (rice (rainfed) / corn)  
45
Introductory Agriculture
www.AgriMoon.Com

b. Shaleyam (kamala (wet) rice)  
c. Tilyam (sesamum)  
d. Mashyam (blackgram)  
e. Maudginam (mung bean)  
 
Sangam, Tamil literature classified soils as mullai (forest), Kuringi (hills), marudham 
(cultivable) and neithal (coastal).  
Maintenance of soil productivity  
Traditional soil management practices are the product of centuries of accumulated 
knowledge, experience and wisdom refined and perpetuated over generations. These practices 
were evolved within the framework of local technical possibilities. They enlivened the soil, 
strengthened the natural resources diversify and maintained the production levels in accordance 
with the carrying capacity of agro-ecosystem without damaging it.  
Ancient farmers mostly relied on crop residues, manures, legumes and neem for enriching 
soil fertility.  
In Kirishi - parashara, it is stated that crops grown without manure will not give yield and 
stressed the importance of manures. He also recommended compost preparation from cow 
dung. The dried, powdered cow dung is placed in pit for decomposition where weed seeds are 
destroyed. The time duration for composting is two weeks.  
Kautilya mentioned the use of cowdung, animal bones, fishes, milk as manure. Surapala 
describes the ancient practice of preparing liquid manure (kunapa) prepared by boiling a mixture 
of animal excreta, bone marrow, flesh, dead fish in an iron pot and then add it to sesame oil 
cake, honey and ghee. This is clearly evident that present day Panchakavya is prepared in the 
same way and used in all crops.  
Liquid manure (Kunapa) : Preparation of kunapa involves boiling flesh, fat, and marrow 
46
Introductory Agriculture

of animals such as pig, fish, sheep or goats in water, placing it in earthen pot, and adding milk, 
powders of sesame oil cake, black gram boiled in honey, decoction of pulses, ghee and hot 
water. There is no fixed proportion of ingredients. The pot is put in a warm place for two weeks. 
This fermented liquid manure is called kunapa.  
Green manures :  
In Rajasthan : Prosopis cineraria - brings up moisture and nutrients from the  
                        underground and leaves used    as green manure.  
In Tamil Nadu : Calotropis gigantiea, Mortinda tinctoria Theprosia  purpurea, Jatropha,  
                        Ipomoea Adathoda  
In North India :  A traditional weed Kochia indica used as green    manure.  
Ancient farmers adopted crop rotation and inter cropping to restore soil fertility. Mixed or 
inter cropping with legumes in cereal and oil seed cultivation were widely practices. All these 
practices adopted in ancient time are now being recommended today under organic farming 
concept.

09 . Water harvesting and irrigation developments during different periods – water 
storage – distribution and relevance to modern agriculture. 
The need for continuous supply of water for irrigation  whether from canal, well, pond or 
lake is realized as the most important for agriculture in ancient period. It should be preserved by 
all sorts of efforts for the benefit of agriculture. The different irrigation principles adopted in 
ancient period are :  
 Construction of large mud embankment on a stone foundation   for diverting flood water 
from the river.  
 Building of small tanks.  
 It is also indicated that severe penalty was imposed when water   is let out other than 
sluice gate.  
 Extensive tank irrigation systems were adopted in Sri Lanka   and later in South India. In 
Srilanka ancient kings practiced   that not even a drop of rainfall should go to sea without 
benefiting   man.  
 The topography of Telengana region of Andhra Pradesh and   Karnataka is ideally suited 
for the construction of tanks. A special   feature of tanks in Telengana tank construction 
in series, by   bunding the same valley at several points and surplus water from   lower 
elevation and so on. Even now the tanks constructed by   chola king in the same way 
exist today in Tamil Nadu.  
 Every farmer emphazises the efficient and skilful use of water.  
 It is also suggested that preference of the use of water should be   in the order of food 
crop, vegetables and flowers.  
 For the mainteance of tanks, a committee of villages called `eri-  variyam’ was 
appointed. The committee ensured repairs and   de-silting tanks and distribution of

irrigation from wells.  
Bullocks to draw water from wells for irrigation was practiced and pulled a leather bag with 
ropes. Persian well was used for drawing water from wells which  was developed in North India.  
HISTORY OF IRRIGATION DEVELOPMENT IN INDIA  
Period 
Irrigation Development 
1.  
Ancient Period 
2500 - 1000 BC 
People settled near the banks     of 
river / tanks for the purpose     of 
getting water for drinking     and 
irrigation. 
2. 
Chalcolithic 
3000 - 1700 BC 
Practice of irrigation to crops     was 
evolved. 
3. 
Vedic period 
1500 - 1600 BC 
People employed craftsman to     dig 
channels from rivers to     their fields. 
Well irrigation     through kuccha and 
puccha     wells and were practiced 
4. 
Pandyas 
/ 
Cholal

(1st Century 300 AD) 
Irrigated rice cultivation   started during 
this period.     Dams and Tanks were 
constructed for irrigation. 
5. 
Medieval period 
(1200 - 1700 AD) 
Irrigated agriculture was     developed 
during Mogul     period. Canals, Dams 
and     Tanks were constructed (e.g.)

Methods of conserving rain water  
In ancient days itself, people, especially Indians, know the methods of conservation of rain 
water. There are evidences that, even during Harappan period, there was very good system of 
water management as could be seen in the latest excavation at Dholavira in Kachch. During 
Independence period, the people use to manage water resources considering it as part of the 
nature which is essential for their survival. This could be seen from the rain water harvesting 
structures in the low rainfall areas of Rajasthan, harvesting springs in hilly areas and 
mountainous region and percolation ponds and tanks in southern India.  
In Tamil Nadu, the ancient  people stored rainwater in public, placed separately one for 
drinking purposes and another for bathing and other domestic purposses and called them as 
Ooranies. They also formed percolation tanks or ponds, for the purpose of recharging irrigation 
or domestic wells. They periodically clean the water ways so as to get clean water throughout 
the year. These are instances in the history that people constructed crude rubble bunds across 
river courses either for diversion of water or for augmenting the ground water. The various 
methods of rainwater harvesting are classified below under two category, Traditional and 
Modern methods.  
Traditional rainwater harvesting, which is still prevalent in rural areas, was done in surface 
storage bodies like lakes, ponds, irrigation tanks, temple tanks etc. In urban areas, due to 
shrinking of open spaces, rainwater will have to necessarily be harvested as ground water, 
50
Introductory Agriculture
www.AgriMoon.Com

Hence harvesting in such places will depend very much on the nature of the soil viz., clayey, 
sandy etc. The below listed are the various kinds of traditional rainwater harvesting methods.  
The Modern methods of rainwater harvesting are categorised under two, they are Artifical 
Recharging and Rain Water Harvesting. The former is classified into Absorption Pit Method, 
Absorption Well Method, Well cum Bore Method and Recharge trench cum injection well. The 
later is categorised into Individual Houses and Grouped Houses which are further classified into 
Percolation Pit Method, Bore Well with Settlement Tank, Open Well Method with filter bed Sump 
and percolation Pit with Bore Method.  
Bamboo method of rainwater harvesting  
In Meghalaya (one of the seven northeastern states in India), an indegenious system of 
tapping of stream and springwater by using bamboo pipes to irrigate plantations is widely 
prevalent. It is so perfected that about 18-20 litres of water entering the bamboo pipe system 
per minute gets transported over several hundred metres and finally gets reduced to 20-80 
drops per minute at the site of the plant. The tribal farmers of Khasi and Jaintia hills use the 
200-year-old system.  
The bamboo drip irrigation system is normally used to irrigate the betel leaf or black 
pepper crops planted in arecanut orchards or in mixed orchards. Bamboo pipes are used to 
divert perennial springs on the hilltops to the lower reaches by gravity. The channel sections, 
made of bamboo, divert and convey water to the plot site where it is distributed without leakage 
into branches, again made and laid out with different forms of bamboo pipes. Manipulating the 
intake pipe positions also controls the flow of water into the lateral pipes. Reduced channel 
sections and diversion units are used at the last stage of water application. The last channel 
section enables the water to be dropped near the roots of the plant.

In the sandier tracts, the villagers of the Thar Desert had evolved an indegenious system 
of rainwater harvesting known as kunds or kundis. Kund, the local name given to a covered 
underground tank, was developed primarily for tackling drinking water problems. Usually 
constructed with local materials or cement, kunds were more prevalent in the western arid 
regions of Rajasthan, and in areas where the limited groundwater available is moderate to 
highly saline. Groundwater in Barmer, for instance, in nearly 76 per cent of the district’s area, 
has total dissolved salts (TDS) ranging from 1,500-10,000 parts per million (ppm). Under such 
conditions, kunds provide convenient, clean and sweetwater for drinking. Kunds were owned by 
communities or privately, with the rich having one or more kunds of their own. Community kunds 
were built through village cooperation or by a rich man for the entire community.  
Traditional Rain water harvesting  
The traditional rainwater harvesting methods in North India is surface water harvesting 
methods are viz., Tanka, Nada, Nadi, Talai, Talab, Khadin Sar, Sagar and Samend. Depending 
upon rainfall, topography of area, type of soil, the water harvesting methods are different from 
region to region.  
Tanka  
It is one of the ancient, common and relatively hygenic methods of water storage. It is 
constructed of on farm, country yard and fort. The shape is normally circular / square. 
Dimension is 2 m dia. 3 m deep capacity 10000 lit. It is made on sloping land to arrest run off 
water in the farm; however in houses the construction is made on an elevated place to avoid 
entry of dirty water in to it.  
Talai  
Similar to Tanka, still deeper (2-3cm depth). Special attention paid for selection of location 
such that there is adequate flow of rain water into Talai. Care is also taken so that loose soil 
does not flow along with water stream.

Nada  
In this method, low lying areas in between hillocks is excavated as pit and provided 
embankment to arrest rain water from these hillocks. The catchment area of Nada is 5 to 10 ha. 
The Nada is constructed on rangeland, barren land pastureland and agriculture field. It provides 
short-term storage of rainwater and mainly used for animals.  
Nadi  
Compared to Nada. the Nadi is bigger in size. A village or group of Villages uses the run 
off water collected in the Nadi. Depth is 6-8m, catchment area 10-150 ha. In the Nadi, water is 
available for whole of the year as a result it provides shelter for many wild animals and birds.  
Talab  
It is relatively shallow and spread over to more area compared to Nadi. It is generally 
constructed in rangeland. The catchment area of Talab is 480 ha, when it is filled its fullest 
capacity can lost for many years.  
Khadin  
Accumulation of run off water in between hillocks is known as Khadin. Khadin means 
cultivation crops. The khadin water is generally used for crop cultivation and animals.  
Sar, Sagar and Samand  
It is used to harvest rainwater for irrigation purpose. Even today this structure provides 
excellent source of reservoir and also tourist spot.  
Practices of irrigation and rainwater harvesting adopted in ancient period were more 
relevant in Indian  agriculture  today.

10. PLANT PROTECTION IN ANCIENT PERIOD – ITK – HARVESTING – THRESHING AND 
STORAGE 
In the past when Indians were gaining knowledge on the prediction of rainfall, 
management of agriculture, farm operations, harvesting, and storage, nothing was known about 
plant protection. The only methods to protect the crop were prayers and mantras. It was 
believed that the crop is protected if the mantra was written with red lac-dye and tied to the crop. 
But it cannot be said that the people of that time were unaware of insects and other pests and 
their damage. Some of the pests (in Sanskrit) affecting crops were gandhi, Shankhi, 
Pandarmundi, dhuli, and shringari. It is certain that gandhi (offensive odour) is what is called 
today the gandhi bug (Leptocorisa varicornis F.); shankhi must be a snail (Pila sp.); and 
pandarmundi means white head which is the typical symptom of the attack of rice stem borer 
(Tryporyza incertulus Walker). It is certain that they knew the rice stem borer and its symptom of 
attack. Dhuli means powder and it is possible that this word must have been used for powdery 
mildew of wheat and barley. The word “shringari” in Sanskrit indicates something adorned with 
red colour and it is possible that the term was used for rust diseases.  
 
Besides these pests, goats, rats, wild boars, pigs, deers, parrots, and sparrows were 
mentioned as destroyers of crops. In fact when the damage to crops due to different pests 
reached the economic injury level, they might have started thinking about plant protection and 
diverted their efforts to develop protection technology. It is significant that people at that time 
considered that plants and human beings have similar physiology. Therefore, they divided the 
diseases of plants into two categories: (1) internal; and (2) external. The internal diseases were 
those which were caused by “vata”, “pitta”, and  “kafa” and external diseases were those which 
were caused by insects, birds, and weather. These categories can be attributed today to fungi,

bacteria, viruses, and nematodes-internal diseases; and insects, non-insect pests, frost,

Today integrated pest management (IPM) is considered a recent approach for plant 
protection but the so called recent approach was conceptualized and practised centuries ago in 
India. Some of the practices adopted in those days are given below.  
Seed treatment : Seed treatment which is considered an important component of IPM to 
ensure better germination was given a lot of importance in ancient times. The seed was treated 
with milk, mustard, sesame-ash, and cowdung for better germination and protection against 
insect pests.  
Fumigation : Fumigation methods were not as developed in those days as they are today 
but the concept of fumigation was prevalent. For example, diseases of cucurbits were controlled 
by smoking the bones of cow and dog mixed with the excreta of cat.  
Field application : The plant protection appliances of the present era were not developed 
at that time; sprinkling of aqueous suspension and hand-dusting of  various materials were 
used. For the control of insect pests several ancient recommendations are available. Some of 
them are as follows:  
· 
Insects infesting trees can be removed by smoking a mixture of   white mustard, black 
peper, asafoetida, vidanga (Embelia ribes),   vaca (Zingiberzerumbet), and water mixed 
with beef, horn of a   buffalo, flesh of pigeon, and the powder of bhillata (Semecarpus   
anacardium).  
57

· 
Insects infesting creepers can be controlled by sprinkling water mixed   with oilcake.  
· 
Leaf-eating insects can be destroyed by dusting cowdung-ash and   brick-dust.  
· 
Trees are watered with cold water for 7 days to remove  insects   from the roots and 
branches.  
· 
A wound caused by insects is healed if sprinkled with milk after   being anointed with 
mixture of vidanga, sesame, cow’s urine, ghee,   and mustard.  
 
A new term, eco-friendly pesticides, has been coined recently. In IPM more emphasis is 
laid on this term and botanicals are being used instead of  chemical pesticides. In fact this is not 
new. Years ago several botanicals and other materials which have biocidal properties were 
identified and recommended by Surapala to control plant diseases. The famous “panchamula” 
(roots of five plants) which was commonly used at that time has antifungal, antiviral, 
antibacterial, and antifeeding properties. Likewise, mustard had been used for all kinds of 
diseases caused by “kafa”. We now know that mustard causes antibiosis in insects; in addition it 
is antifungal and has nematicidal activity.

Materials and practices that need our early attention  
Milk and milk products : Milk and ghee have been used for centuries. Even buttermilk was 
found useful. About 40% of total aminoacids in milk are glutamate, leucine, and proline. Milk is 
reported to contain plant growth promoters. A recent report  claimed that milk sprays induced 
systemically acquired resistance in chilli against leaf curl, a viral disease. Milk (10% aqueous 
suspension) also has been effectively used for controlling powdery mildews. Besides, milk has 
excellent sticker-spreader properties.  
The aminoacid proline has been found to systemically induce resistance in plants. It 
stimulates production of antimicrobial phenolics. High amounts of endogenous proline increase 
contents of cytokinin and auxins. Besides milk, proline is present in the connective tissues of 
animals including fish.  
Application of cowdung : Use of cowdung for dressing seeds, plastering cut ends of 
vegetatively propagating units such as sugarcane setts, dressing wounds, sprinkling diluted 
suspension on plants, and applying to soil has been indicated since the time of Kautilya (c.300 
BC). Indian farmers continue to use cowdung in various ways, but the agricultural scientists 
have ignored its use for other purposes except manure.  
Briefly speaking cowdung from the cattleshed is a mixture of dung and urine, generally in 
a ratio of 3:1. Cowdung consists of crude fiber, crude protein, and materials that can be 
obtained in nitrogen-free extracts and ether extracts. Cellulose along with lignin makes up most 
of the crude fiber; hemicellulose and pentosans (poly saccharides based on pentose sugars) 
are also present. Micronutrients too are present in cowdung. The urine portion of cowdung 
contains nitrogen, potash, and sulfur and only traces of phosphorus. The nitrogenous 
compounds excreted in fecal matter consist in part undigested or unabsorbed food nitrogen and 
60
Introductory Agriculture
www.AgriMoon.Com

in part another fraction called metabolic nitrogen. The metabolic fraction comprises substances 
originating in the body such as residues of the bile and other digestive juices, epithelial cells 
from the alimentary tract, and the bacterial residues. In short, fecal residues comprise 
undigested fiber, debris from sloughed-off intestinal epithelium, some excreted products derived 
from bile (eg. pigments), intestinal bacteria, and mucus. There are more than 60 species of 
bacteria and over 100 species of protozoa encountered in the rumen of a cow. A majority of the 
bacteria are cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin fermenters. The bile constituents are bile salts, 
bile acids, and bile pigments. Bile salts confer hydrophilic coat to otherwise hydrophobic 
droplets, thus acting as emulsifying agents. No bile salt is supposed to be present in the dung 
because these are reabsorbed through the intestine and are put back in the bile. However, in 
each such cycle (enterohepatic circulation) involving bile salts, a small part is lost through 
bacterial degradation in the feces as dyslysin which is the slimy material. Bile salts have 
antiseptic properties. Two chief bile pigments are bilirubin (reddish / golden yellow) and 
biliverdin (green). It is the biliverdin (C33H36N4O8) which is chiefly present in herbivorous 
animals and gives greenish color to the dung.

Harvesting and Threshing  
Kautilya Arthasasthra states “Grains and other crops shall be collected as often as they 
are harvested. The threshing of different fields shall be in close proximity. In Sangam literature it 
is mentioned that paddy was removed from the stalks by beating them on ground or by making 
63

the bullocks to tread on them. Cleaned paddy was collected, measured and stored in proper 
places. Sickles and swords were used for harvesting millet. For threshing, buffaloes were made 
to tread or men are used to tread ears with feet. Blackgram was threshed with sticks. Women 
considerably contributed to threshing and cleaning. A common vessel for measuring grain was 
referred as “ambanam”  
Festivals were celebrated before the commencement of harvest and during the time of 
harvest. For threshing, Parashara mentioned a levelled threshing “pit” and installation of 
threshing pillar called “medhi” are mentioned. The wood for the pillar was obtained from a tree 
that produces milky sap, preferably by silk cotton, Ficus bengalensis, F. glomerata.

11. CROPS – INDIGENOUS AND INTRODUCED - HISTORY OF RICE, SUGARCANE AND 
COTTON 
Since time immemorial, cereals, particularly wheat, rice, and maize are considered to be 
life sustaining crops for humans. Even in future these crops will play a pivotal role in food 
security system of several nations across the world. The utilization of cereals as food and feed, 
and for industrial purpose is around 1792 million out of which wheat, rice, and coarse grains 
contribute nearly 35.4%, 20.8%, and 53.7% respectively. In the past fifty years the world has 
witnessed structural change in cereal economics:  
 
Long run trend towards wheat and rice and to some extent for maize, while replacement of 
coarse grain crops occurred.  
 
Developing countries achieved higher growth in production and consumption and at the 
same time recorded rise in deficits.  
 
Rapid expansion of cereals as feed in developing countries and increased share of 
cereals in world trade.  
 
It has been projected that world demand for cereals will increase by 2-3% per annum in 
the next 25 years mainly due to increase in population as well as change in taste and income of 
the people. This projection clearly suggests that despite impressive growth the world community 
is still facing the daunting task to maintain adequate food supply for larger sections of population 
and this will further aggravate in future

Source: Tisdale et al. (1993).  
In recent years, the concept of “sustainable agriculture development” has been introduced 
to the world community by the “Bruntland Commission”, which has been accepted by all the 
countries. It ensures that “long-term effects of development do not damage the rightful heritage 
of future generations.” More specifically referring to food security, it calls for “increasing 
production to satisfy growing demands while at the same time preserving basic ecological 
66
Introductory Agriculture
www.AgriMoon.Com

integrity of production system.” Such sustainable development in agriculture emphasizes 
conservation of land, water, plant, and animal genetic resources through technically appropriate, 
economically viable, socially acceptable methods. Presently, utilization and access to genetic 
resources have become an increasingly important issue because:  
Technological advancement in molecular biology and biotechnology have opened new 
avenues for widening gene pool of several crops.  
Legal situation concerning ownership of genetic resources have changed (patent law, 
state ownership)  
The decline/less recognition in value of biological diversity has made risk of their 
extinction/shortages.  
Agricultural development in the recent past has markedly accelerated erosion of plant 
genetic material, loss of genetic diversity, or heterogeneity on one hand while on the other hand 
it has increased uniformity and genetic vulnerability of cultivated species to diseases and pests. 
This necessitates indepth knowledge of the history of cereals involving the origin, process of 
domestication, and morpho-physiological changes that occurred during the evolutionary 
process. These aspects can help in conservation of primitive types and further improvement in 
genetic capabilities of these crops.  
Rice  
Rice is the most important tropical cereal and supplies a quarter of the entire caloric intake 
of the human race. About 90% of its area and consumption is in South and Southeast Asia, 
which support a major part of the world population. Rice belongs to the genus Oryza and there 
are two main cultigens, i.e., sativa in Asia and glaberrima in Africa. Rice is a semi aquatic 
graminaceous crop having great deiversity as it is grown in complex range of environments, i.e., 
from uplands at altitude of 3000m to rainfed lowland irrigated, tidal swamp, and deepwater 
areas. Besides these two species, aquatic rice species, i.e., Zizania aquatica and Z. palustris, 
67
Introductory Agriculture
www.AgriMoon.Com

are endemic to North America, where it is the staple food of Indians.  
Origin  
The place of major diversity where rice might have domesticated is roughly the east west 
belt along the Himalayas and adjoining Asia mainland (from Assam, Bangladesh, Burma, 
Thailand, southern China, and northeren Vietnam). The archaeological evidence suggests that 
Asian rice culture was established around 7000 years ago. In India carbonized grains excavated 
from Hastinapur (New Delhi) suggest that it was in cultivation during 1100-800 BC. 
Subsequently, the grain samples collected at Atrankikar (Uttar Pradesh) were oldest (1500-1100 
BC). It has  been inferred from the excavation of rice samples belonging to 5000-4000 BC in 
Thailand that from this place rice spread to other countries.  
Evolutionary history  
The evidences from diverse disciplines including biosystematic and paleogeology suggest 
that the genus Oryza arose from a common ancestor. The evolutionary path was from wild 
perennial to wild annual to cultivated annual, and the closely related wild relatives contributed 
differentiation of two cultigens. In oryza sativa, the evolution of different geographical races, i.e., 
japonica, javanica, and indica (the latter forming aman, aus, and indica types in the Ganges 
belt) took place assisted strongly by human selecton. There is general agreement that in both 
Asia and Africa elongation and floating ability in two cultigens was derived from their wild 
relatives. Regarding transformation from perenial to annual types, a theory has been advanced 
which suggest that climatic changes during the Pleistocene period induced physiological stress 
in herbaceous flora, which accelerated evolution of annuals from perennials. In rice, change 
might have occurred in the following sequence:  
Perennial->climatic stress->seasonal->human selection-> cultivated rice.  
Future strategies  
68

The primitive cultivars and allied wild species of cultivated rice constitute a store house of 
rare and valuable genes but their use in the breeding programme is limited because these 
possess many undesirable characters such as shattering of grains, sterility, and red grains.In 
recent years, the precise elimination of undesirable characters while maintaining vital 
characteristics has been found possible as evident from the fact that:  
Four different spontanea types (O.rufipogon) subjected to different chemical mutagens 
treatment, produced short plants with thick, erect leaves, and profuse tillering and possessed a 
different source of dwarfening gene.  
Short culm mutants induced in the Assam type of O. rufipogon produced higher yield and 
proved more adaptable under waterlogged conditions during the monsoon compared to the 
variety IR 8.  
Rice species growing under marshy areas provide  excellent sources of resistance to 
drought and waterlogged conditions.  
Agri-history of Cotton in India :  An Overview  
The antiquity of cotton in the Indian subcontinent has been traced to the 4th millenium BC. 
The fabrics dated approximately 3000 BC , recovered from the Mohenjo-daro excavations in 
Sind (Pakistan), were identified to have originated from cotton plants, closely related to the 
Gossypium arboreum species. The lint-bearing species of the genus Gossypium, the true 
cottons, are four, out of which the diploid (2n=26) species G. arboreum and G. herbaceum are 
indigenous in Asia and Africa.  
The history of introduction into India of the new world cottons (tetraploid species of G. 
hirsutum and G. barbadense with 2n=52) dates back to the 18th century AD. By the last decade 
of the 20th century, India had gained a pride of place in the global cotton statistics with the 
largest cropped area of 8.9 million in 1996-97, growing the most diverse cultivars in terms of 
botanical species and composition, producing the widest range of cotton fiber quality suitable for 
69
Introductory Agriculture
www.AgriMoon.Com

spinning 6’s to 120’s counts yarn, and supporting the largest agrobased national industry of the 
country.  
Origin of the indigenous cottons  
The cotton textiles of the Harappan civilization (2300-1750BC) were produced by 
sophisticated textile craftsmanship. Thus at the earliest agricultural levels yet discovered, true 
cottons were already present in the Indian  subcontinent.  
Wild and weedy types have been found to be associated with primitive cultivated types in 
both the old world species of G. herbaceum and  G. arboreum.  
Species of G. herbaceum, have been found from the coastal strip northwest of Karachi 
(Pakistan), through northern Baluchistan to south Yemen, Ethiopia, and Sudan and even in 
West Africa south of the Sahara. Species of G. arboreum. have been recorded by in Kathiawar, 
Gujarat, Khandesh, and the Deccan in India. It seems likely that it was in Gujarat (India) or Sind 
(Pakistan) that G. arboreum cottons were first brought into cultivation (Hutchinson, 1971).  
It may further be surmised that the differentiation of the three perennial races of G. 
arboreum, namely burmanicum of northeastern India, indicum of western India and the 
Penninsula, and sudanense of northern Africa, ante-dated domestication and that each 
contributed separately to the cultivated cottons in Asia and Africa.  
Agri-history of cotton production development  
Until the middle of the 18th century, only indigenous arboreum and herbaceum varieties of 
cotton were grown in different regions of the country. Due to the human skills and dexterity of 
the local artisans, very fine yarns were produced by them, from even the short staple and 
coarse cottons grown in India.  
In 1788, the Governor General (at Calcutta) was requested by London to encourage 
growth and improvement of Indian cottons to meet the requirements of the Lancashire textile

industry. The figures for exact area under indigenous cottons and production in India during this 
period are not available, although it is reported that the local production  had stabilized by 1900 
AD.   
Sugarcane  
The origin of sugarcane was India. The species saccharum officinarum was first 
domesticated in India and the spread to other countries by Arab merchants. Evidences revealed 
that 3000-7000 years ago, Atarna veda indicated that sugarcane originated from the area 
Sakkaram and then later it was indicated as sakkra in Sanskirit. Earlier indications in Kautilya 
Artha Sastra also mentioned about the cowdung sett treatment for sugarcane.

12. GARDENING IN ANCIENT AND MEDIEVAL PERIOD – ARBORI HORTICULTURE - 
ORCHARDS 
Man is inseparable from nature. Since prehistoric times, the Indian people have had close 
relationship with nature, particularly plants and flowers. The cult of tree worship has been a 
tradition and faith in India through the ages. Trees and flowers have been sanctified in Indian 
mythology, history, art and socio-religious culture. The pre-historic and proto-historic man in the 
Indus Valley had great reverence for trees and worshipped them during the chalcolithic period. 
Tree was worshipped in its natural form and as tree spirit personified as human attributes in 
Mohenjo-daro and Harappa. The divine character of the trees has been depicted in a number of 
seals, sealings, potteries, potsherds and some rock paintings as archeological evidences of the 
Mohenjodaro and Harappa period (2500-1750 BC). A few trees, such as pipal or asvattha (Ficus 
religosa), neem (Azadirachta indica), katha or khadira (Acacia catechu) and jhand or sami 
(Prosopis cineraria) were held sacred by the ancient people of the Indus Valley. In the Indus 
Valley Civilization, the belief was that trees were symbolic of gods and goddesses, which dwelt 
in them (vriksha devata or vriksha devi). In ancient India trees were considered to be divine and 
spiritual as the tree knowledge (brahma tarn), the tree of life Uivan tarn) and also as medicinal 
tree (rogu tarn).  
 Mauryan period  
After the rise of the Mauryas in the 4th to 3rd century BC, there has been vast secular 
literature and texts, both Vedic and post-Vedic, like Vedas, Brahamanas, Aranyakas, 
Upanishadas, Sutras, Smritis, Mahakavyas, Puranas, Buddhists texts (Jataka) and Jain 
literature (Sutras). The sages of the Upanishadas have described the Cosmic Tree rooted in the 
Brahman, the ultimate, whose branches are space, wind, fire, water and earth. The cosmic tree 
78

is the World Mother, the Goddess of nature, which nourishes all Life. Kalpavrksa (wish-fulfilling 
tree) and kalpalata (wish-fulfilling creeper) are mythological tree and creeper, not mentioned in 
the Vedic literature, which have been a part of folk cult in Hindu mythology. Kalpavrksa is 
mentioned in Ramayana, Mahabharata, Jatakas, Divyavadana and the Jain Sutras. In 
Brahamanical religion, vata (Ficus benghalensis) was identified with Shiva, asvattha (Ficus 
religiosa) with Vishnu, lotus with Surya (Sun) and nine leaves of nine trees (navapatrika) with 
nine different aspects of Durga.  
There are vivid descriptions of trees in the Rigveda (3700-2000 BC), the Ramayana 
(1200-1000 BC), The Mahabharata as well as other literature by Shudraka (100 BC), Kalidasa 
(c. 57 BC), Ashvaghosha (100 AD), Vatsyayana (300-400 AD) and Sarangdhara (1300 AD). 
The art of gardening and kinds of gardens were described by Sarangdhara and Vatsyayana, 
respectively.  
In the Ramayana, mention is made of Ashokavana or Panchavati, in which Sita was held 
captive. Ashoka trees (Saraca asoca) were predominant in this garden. In the Panchavati, five 
trees were planted, asvattha (Ficus religiosa) on the,east side, bilva (Aegle marmelos) on the 
north, the banyan (Ficus benghalensis) on the west, amla (Emblica officinalis) on the south and 
the ashoka (Saraca asoca) on the southeast. A description of the layout of gardens and parks 
and artificial lakes in the city of Indraprastha is given in the Sabha-Parva of the Mahabharata. 
Several trees, such as Saraca asoca, Terminalia arjuna, Mesua ferrea, Ficus benghalensis, F. 
religosa, Michelia champaka, Butea monosperma and Cassia fistula, have been mentioned in 
the Ramayana. Almost all of them also have been described in the Mahabharat. It is said that 
Lord Buddha was born under the pipal tree in a garden. The bodhi tree, under which the 
Buddha attained nirvana, is sacred to Buddhists. The trees and plants mentioned in Buddhist 
texts include asvattha (Ficus religiosa), banyan (Ficus benghalensis), udumbara (Ficus 
glomerata), patali (Bignonia suaveolens), sala (Shorea robusta) and sirisa (Acacia sarisa). The 
79
Introductory Agriculture

planting of roadside avenue trees (margeshuvriksha) was an important contribution of the king 
Ashoka (233 BC).  
Vedic times  
The trees and the plants mentioned in the Vedic times were, soma (Sarcostemma 
acidum), pipal/asvanha (Ficus religiosa), sami (Prosopis ceneraria), banyan (Ficus 
benghalensis), udumbara (Ficus glome rata) , bilva (Agele marmelos); khadira (Acacia catechu), 
neem (Azadirachta indica), palasa/plpksa (Butea monosperma), tulsi (Ocimum sanctum) and 
lotus (Nelumbo nucifera). The other trees and plants of the Vedic and post-Vedic period include 
salmalilsilk cotton tree (Bombax ceiba), coconut (Cocos nucifera), rudraksha (Elacocarpus 
sphaericus), snuhi (Euphorbia neriifolia), madhavi lata (Hiptage madablota), amalka (Emblica 
officinalis; syn. Phyllanthus emblica), mango, amra (Mangifera indica), banana, plantain / kadali 
or rambha (Musa paradisiacal), ber / vadari (Zizyphus mauritina), sala/shal (Shorea robusta), 
asoka (Saraca asoca), kadamba (Anthocephalus cadamba), bahira (Terminalia belli rica), 
arjuna (Terminalia arjuna), nagavalli, tambula or paan (Piper betle), nalaka (Arundo donax), 
jivaka(Putranjiva roxburghii), mandara (Erythrina variegata), tili/tila (Sesamum indicum), 
amarphal (Monstera deliciosa), Ficus krishnae, gaduchi (Cocculus cordifolius), ketaki 
(Pandanus odoratissimus), imli/tintrini (Tamarindus indica), parijata (Nycanthes arbortristis) and 
tinduku (Diospyros peregrina).  
Tree worship and trees and environment  
Tree motifs have been found in the art of Indus Valley, Mauryan ring stones, and 
gateways and railings of stupas at Bharhut, Bodhgaya, Sanchi, Amaravati and Nagajunakonda, 
Mauryan relief sculptures, particularly on the Ashokan Pillar Capitals and Rampura Bull Capital 
of Ashoka. Old sculptures and architecture of Mathura (Kanishka period, AD 78-101) and Ajanta 
frescoes (AD 100-600) also bear testimony to the importance of plants and flowers in ancient 
India. The relationship of trees with the Brahamanical and Buddhist gods and goddesses and 
80

Jain Tirthankaras in Indian art date back from the 151 century AD to 1200 AD. Trees and 
flowers have been also delineated in ancient coins found at the pre-Mauryan site, Sugh, Taxila, 
Ayodhya during Mitra Kings, Kausambi and Mathura and also of the Andhra dynasty and 
Pandyan territory. The ancient Sanskrit and other literature and texts, mythological epics and 
legends, paintings, cave murals and frescoes, sculptures, architecture, folklores and tribal arts 
and crafts provide evidences of the kind of plants and trees and flowers growing in the forests 
and gardens. The science of plant life, (Vrikshayurveda) and arbori-horticulture, and usefulness 
of forests and gardens were well-known in ancient India. The utilitarian qualities of trees and 
plants for food, medicine, shelter, shadow and fuel, and the relationship of trees with fertility 
were also known to ancient Indians. They were concerned with the conservation of trees and 
biodiversity in nature and ecological balance in environment. Their concept of identifying trees 
with gods and goddesses, and threats and punishments against the destruction of useful trees 
helped to save the trees and flora, which is a remarkable contribution of our ancient people.   
 
Mughal period  
With the renaissance of gardening in India by the Mughal rulers beginning with Babur, 
many plant species were brought by them from Persia and Central Asia where herbaceous and 
bulbous flowers were already under cultivation. Many of these have been mentioned in 
autobiographies and other books written during those days. Besides, in Mughal paintings also 
we find illustrations of many flowers. These have also been used to illustrate the borders of 
those paintings. In the book Bagh-I- Wafa. Babur has presented a description of gardening in 
India.  
During the 16th and 17th centuries AD, Mughal gardens were developed in Agra, Delhi, 
Pinjore (near Shimla) , Srinagar, Kashmir and a few other places. The most important Mughal 
gardens are the Taj Mahal Garden, Agra; Shalimar and Nishat Gardens, Srinagar; Pinjore 
81

Gardens, Pinjore and the garden at Hamayun’s tomb, Delhi. The rose was introduced into our 
country via the port of Bussorah by Babur in around 1526. Jehangir and Nurjehan were ardent 
lovers of the rose and encouraged rose growing in gardens. The most important plants 
introduced in Kashmir from Persia by the Mughal ruler, Jehangir in 1619 when he laid out the 
famous Shalimar Bagh in Srinagar, were the majestic Chinar tree (Platanus orientalis), the 
cypress (Cupresus sempervirens) and the weeping willow (Salix babylonica), and flowers like 
rose, narcissus, daffodil, iris, lilies, tulip and carnation.  
European period  
Later, mainly Englishmen and the Portuguese introduced many species. Missionaries and 
priests, civil servants and individual amateur, gardeners mostly brought these in. One of the 
important missionaries who introduced a number of exotic plants was Dr Firminger, an 
Englishman, who wrote a book on gardening, giving descriptions of various species of flowers in 
1863. The book titled ‘Firminger’s Manual of Gardening in India’ is an authoritative reference 
book on ornamental flowering plants even today.  
With the establishment of Government Botanic Gardens by the British rulers during 18th 
and 19th centuries, such as Lalbagh Botanical Garden, Bangalore (1760); the Government 
Botanic Garden, Saharan pur (1779); the Indian Botanic Garden, Sibpur, Calcutta (1787); the 
Lloyd Botanic Garden, Darjeeling (1878); and the Government Botanic Garden, Oatacamund 
(1884), numerous economic plants as well as ornamentals were introduced in these gardens.  
Among the noteworthy introductions of that period are the mahogany (Swietenia 
mahogany) from Jamaica in 1795 and the Giant Amazon lily, Victoria regia, into Sibpur garden 
followed by Grevillea robusta and Araucaria exceLsa in 1857 and Amherstia nobiLis in ] 859 in 
the Lalbagh Botanical Garden, Bangalore. A few important and rare flowers of India are

13. TRADITIONAL TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE 
With the spectacular achievement in the field of agricultural sciences, India has been able 
to reach the stage of self-sufficiency in the agricultural production. But, in this change, we 
overlooked and rejected sustainable natural farming systems and moved towards “exploitative” 
agriculture with increased dependency on farm machinery and chemicals (fertilizers, pesticides, 
etc.), which proved counter productive and resulted in depletion of soil and water resources, 
increase in desert and climatic disturbances, natural calamities, deterioration of environment, 
and unprecedented fuel wood cries. Among many challenges in the coming years, the basic 
issue will/be to find ways for sustainable development which are environmentally sound and 
make the earth a better place to live in.  
The best solution of this problem could be to blend the modern technology with the 
traditional one. The integration of scientific and traditional knowledge would help, to develop 
technologies, which are need-based, better problem-solving, locally available, easily acceptable, 
cost-effective, convincing and credible to the rural clientele.  
There is a lot of indigenous agricultural know-how available with the farming communities 
specially the tribals. These traditional farming systems are products of centuries of accumulated 
experiences. Farmers all over the world have developed their own indigenous systems of 
farming with local inputs. In India the traditional system of farming is being practiced since the 
Vedic age (3700 BC).  
This traditional wisdom can disappear unless their understanding values are promoted. 
Many of the practices, which were beneficial and were being used since generations have been 
lost because of lack of appreciation. Therefore, there is a need to explore the indigenous 
practices being used by the tribals and to get these scientifically validated for wider use by the 
farming community.

Crop Protection  
Traditional systems of crop protection, rooted in the simple practices that farmers have 
learnt from their long association with the land, its flora and fauna, were based on ecofriendly 
systems of suitable cultural practices, judicious rotation of crops, and knowledge of pests and 
their life cycles. Some of the traditional methods of cultivation, which has direct bearing on pest 
control, are:  
1. Maize seeds are soaked in cow urine for 10-12 hours before sowing.   According to 
farmers, this treatment increases resistance against insect   pests.  
2. Rice seedlings raised from seed treated with extract of neem kernel are   vigorous and  
resistant to leafhopper.  
3. In paddy, spraying a solution of 4 l of cow urine and 10 g asafoetida in   10 l of water, 
repel the sucking pests (aphids,jassids).  
4. In paddy, spraying a solution of cow dung prepared by mixing 3 kg cow   dung in 3 l of  
water was observed in the study area against the control   of paddy blast and bacterial 
blight.  
5. In case of insect holes made by shoot borer and bark eaters in mango   tree, jaggery is 
placed in the holes to attract other predators (ants), so   that they will feed upon the  
insects present in the hole. Similarly the   practices of pouring kerosene in holes and  
‘blocking holes with cow   dung were also observed in the area.  
6. For prevention of infestation of shoot borer in mango tree, common salt   is mixed with 
soil near the collar region of the tree.  
7. In case of ‘bunchy top’ disease in chilies dusting of ash; use of gugul   (Commiphora 
wightii) smoke; spray of sour butter milk; spray of liquid   waste of tanned leather, and 
spray of cow/goat urine was recorded in   the tribal areas.

8. A peculiar method of controlling diseases in chilli was observed in which   the twigs of 
aak (Calotropis spp.) are placed in chilli field in between   rows. Similarly some farmers 
placed fresh cow dung near the collar   region of plant to prevent it from fungal diseases 
viz., damping off and   die back.  
9. In case of soil-borne diseases viz., root rot, collar rot, etc. and termites,   the castor cake, 
karanj cake, or neem cake were used as a control   measure.  
10. In case of sugarcane crop, use of common salt (100-125 kg/ha) during   intercultural 
operations was found to be common. According to farmers,   the salt is effective against 
termite problem.  
11. During sprouting of sets in sugarcane crop, putting stems of aak   (Calotropis spp.) in the 
irrigation channels is effective against control of   termites, white grub, and borers.  
12. Use of kerosene was also common against control of termites in the field.  
Weather Forecast  
In recent times, there has been a growing demand for more accurate and reliable weather 
forecasts. Modern scientific knowledge and modern methods of weather forecasting have 
originated recently. But, ancient indigenous knowledge is unique to our culture. India had a 
glorious scientific and technological tradition in the past. Our ancient astronomers and 
astrologers made a scientific study of meteorology. Even today, it is common that village 
astrologers (Pundits) are correct in surprisingly high percentage of their weather predictions. 
Unfortunately, with the evident of so-called scientific technologies during the past one-century, 
even if these are reductional and uni-dimensional in nature, the ancient knowledge, which is 
holistic and multidimensional in nature, has been sidelined and totally neglected by today’s so-
called scientific minded rationalists.   
The most common methods of predicting rainfall are :  
87
Introductory Agriculture
www.AgriMoon.Com

1. Rain bird; if the rain bird gives eggs at the ground level then, there will be less rain 
however; if the eggs are laid at higher elevation then it is the indication of more rains. The local 
people assume that eggs of rain bird are laid on such a height that in case of more or less rains, 
the eggs will not be submerged in rainwater. Similarly, if the nanow ends of all the four eggs of 
rain bird are downwards, then it is the indication of good rainfall through out the season.  
2. When the adventitious roots of the banyan tree (Ficus bengalensis) start sprouting 
(tillering), then the local people assume that the rains will appear within 2-4 days.  
3. In castor (Ricinus spp.) and ber (Ziziphus nummularia) when the buds start sprouting, 
then it is predicted that rains will appear within 10-15 days.   
4. The rains will appear after 10-15 days of flowering in babul tree (Acacia nilotica).   
5. As soon as the neem kernels ripen and start falling, it is expected that there will be rains 
after 10-15 days.  
6. Rain may come if damsel  fly flies at ground surface, frogs make noise and ants move 
in line from one place to another.  
The farmers were also forecasting rains by observing the direction of wind/clouds. 
According to them Westerly winds/clouds meant good rainfall. Similarly Northwesterly clouds 
will bring hailstorm and meager rains.  
Animal Management  
Some of the indigenous practices used by the tribals in the area of animal management 
are as under :  
1. Castration in males is done by destroying the spermatic cord with a   stone/hammer and   
applying cow dung / karanj oil as an antiseptic.  
2.  In case of respiratory distress, animals are branded with hot iron rod    on the neck.  
3.  Treatment of bloat is done by drenching indigenous materials like;

 Roots of date palm tree 200 g (ground) and mixed with water.  
 5-10 leaves of custard apple (ground) and black cumin (50 g) mixed    with buttermilk.  
4.  In case of FMD (foot and mouth disease). a small fish wrapped with a   piece of bread is  
 fed to the diseased animal till the animal is not   completely cured.  
5.  For deworming the following measures are taken:  
 Drenching with copper sulfate 25 g in one litre of water.  
 Dilute neem solution  
 Sesame leaves crushed, mixed with water. and strained, are    drenched.  
6.  For control of external parasites. kerosene is applied on the body of   animal with the help  
 of cotton gauze.  
7. To facilitate normal pasturition, cows buffaloes are fed crushed wheat   soaked in water  and 
mixed with jaggery and ghee oil for one month   prior to calving.  
8.  For treatment of anestrus in buffaloes, following measures are taken:  
 Match stick (two match boxes) wrapped in a piece of bread is fed to    animals.  
 Seeds of datura (Datura fastuosa) 4-5 are fed  
 Dry flowers of mahua tree (Madhuca indica) 250 g boiled in llitre are    fed for 5 days.  
 250 g flowers of khakra (Butea monosperma) boiled in llitre of water    are fed for 4-5

days.  
 Crushed sorghum (2 kg) soaked in water is fed for 2-3 days.  
 Droppings of poultry mixed with bread or concentrate is fed.  
 
9.  In case of pneumonia, cactus (used for fencing) is burnt and the ash   mixed with water is  
     drenched twice to the animal.  
10. In case of fractures, (a) leaves of khakra (Butea monosperma) are   bandaged all over      
     the affected part and splints of bamboo are tied   around it. (b) eggs of local poultry  
     breed given.  
11. In case of excessive salivation (FMD) a tuber sooran (Amorphallus   campanulatus) is  
     ground and drenched with water.  
12.  To increase milk production the following methods are adopted:  
 Feeding of boiled crushed maize 1/2 kg to a cow and I kg to a    buffalo for about one 
month.  
 Feeding leaves of sem (Dolichos purpureus) and chan ber (Ziziphus    nummularia) 
increases milk production.  
 After calving, the milk left after sucking of calves is again fed to the    cow/buffalo for 15-
20 days.  
13. Disease Management :  Dipping the foot of animal in its urine for the   control of foot and 
mouth disease; dipping the tail in hot water or by   applying powdered camphor for 
overcoming tail neurosis; feeding ground   neem leaves for internal parasites; feeding 
sprouted whole wheat for   10-15 days continuously for anoestrus, etc. The findings 
portray that a   lot of wisdom still exists in rural areas but there is uncertainty about   
theirexpert validation.

Plants were also featured in personal adornment and beautification of the home. Of the 
climbers, Madhavilata (Hiptage madhablata) received frequent mention in Kalidasa’s play (5th 
century) and among sweet scented shrubs the mask-mallow (Hibiscus abelmoschus) and the 
garland flower (Hedichium coronarium). Description of flowers and gardens and the garland 
flower (Hedichium corononarium). Description of flowers and gardens had been presented in 
ancient Sanskrit classics like Rig Veda (3000-2000 B.C), Ramayana (1200-1000 B.C) and 
Mahabharata (500 B.C). Other Sanskrit books of early days wirtten by Shudraka (100 B.C.), 
(Asvaghosha (100 A.D) and Sarnghara (1283-1301 A.D) also mentioned about flowers and 
gardens. 
 
 
Among the flowers the sacred lotus (Nelumbo mucifera) was the most important and 
numerous references to it occur in Sanskrit literature. Int he days of Moahendjadaro, lotus 
blossoms were wreathed over the head of Sun-God. 
 
 
 
 
During the Buddhist period gardens were laid out around the monasteries and 
stupas and there were beautiful gardens in Nalanada the Taxila.  
 
The Hindus were so fond of ornamental plants that some of them were actualy worhsipped. 
During the Mughal period (16th and 17th centuries AD) and the British period (18th and 19th 
centuries) several ornamental plants were introduced into India. Indian native flora has 
made significant contributions to the gardens of the world and also to the improvement 
of a few flowers like orchids and Rhododendrons.

Mughal period 
 
 The concept  of developing a garden in an enclosed space was introduced by the 
Mughals in India during 16th and 17th centuries.  
 Babur is credited with the introduction of scented Persian rose in India.  
 Akbar the Great (1556-1605), the Mogul emperor of India was the garden lover.  
 Abu-i- Fazi provided a list of 21 fragrant flowering plants along with flower colour and 
season of flowering in Ain-i-Akbari.  
 He also gave another list of 29 plants with flowers notable for their beauty.  
 From the Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri it appears that Jahangir was familiar with nearly all important 
fragrant palnts of India like Michelia champaca, Pendanus odoratissimum,  Mimusops 
elengi, Jasminum officinale. Mughal gardens were developed in Agra, Delhi, Pinjore 
(near Shimala), Srinagar, Karhmir and a few places during the 16th and 17th 
centuries AD.  
 
European period 
 
 Missionary priests, Englishmen, Portuguese, amateur and professional gardeners from 
Europe, Asia and Africa, introduced a large number of plants into Indian gardens.  
 
 Several botanical gardens were established during 18th and 19th centuries in various 
parts of India, where indigenous and exotic plants were introduced and maintained. 
 With the establishment of Government Botanic Gardens by the British rulers during 18th 
and 19th centuries such as Lalbagh Botanical Garden, Bangalore (1760); the 
government Botanic Garden, Saharanpur (1779); the Indian Botanic Garden, Sipbur

Calcatta (1783); the Lloyd Botanic Garden, Darjeeling (1878) and the Government 
Botanic Garden, Oatacamud (1884), numerous economic plants as well as ornamentals 
were introduced in these gardens.  
PERFUMES 
India has a perfumery tradition that dates back to over 5,000 years to Indus Valley civilization. 
The roots, flowers and leaves were used in perfumery. The Sanskrit Encyclopedia 'Manasollasa' 
composed by Someshwara in AD 1127 deals with the blending of perfumes which were used in 
royal baths and for the rituals and worship. The Ain -1- Akbari (17th century) provides a list of 
twenty one fragrant flowering plants along with season and colours. 
 
Preparation of Perfumes (Brhat Samhita):  
 
The word ‘yukti’ means combination and composition. Perfumes and scents are manufactured 
for the benefit of royal personages and inmates of harems.  
 
Medicinal plants and their relevance today 
Medicinal plants in ancient India 
• 
Medicinal and aromatic plants have been used for a long time for their medicinal 
properties.  
• 
About 2000 native plants species have curative properties and 1300 species are known 
for their aroma and flavour.  
• 
The Indian systems of medicines, popularly known as Ayurveda, unani and sidha drugs 
are of great demand in the country.  
• 
There is already spurt in demand of plant based drugs and of late may such native 
species of medicinal values are being brought under systematic cultivation.

• 
Saffron, opium poppy have been under cultivation for many years.  
• 
Opium poppy is perhaps the exotic plant brought under cultivation in the later part of 
16th century through introduction from West Asia. It is one of the cultivated crops where 
the selection pressure has played a major role in developing new varieties and land 
races.  
• 
Cinchona has been introduced in India mainly to fight the menace of malaria and 
diahorrea respectively, while belladonna, ergot,  pyrethrum, henbane and toxglove were 
introduced in India during second world war to meet the demand of raw materials for 
vital drugs. 
• 
India is blessed with a wide variety of soils and agro-climatic situation that supports a 
large variety of plants.  
• 
Out of these, about 65 plants have large and consistent demand in world trade.  
• 
India however produces only limited quantities of these materials.  
• 
Interms of market share in production value, India holds only the 6th place with a mere 
7% share. 
• 
At present, about 90% collection of medicinal plants is from the forests and since 70% of 
the plant collections involve destructive harvesting many useful plant species are 
endangered or threatened.  
• 
In India, more than 15 lakh practitioners use medicinal plants in preventive and curative 
application. 
 
 
There are two ancient systems of medicine in India, the Siddha that flourished in the 
South and the Ayurveda prevalent in the North. Instead of giving the name of any one individual 
as the founder of either system, our ancients wisely attributed their origin to the Creator. 
According to tradition, it was Shiva who unfolded the knowledge of Siddha system of medicine 
96
Introductory Agriculture
www.AgriMoon.Com

to his consort, Parvati, who handed it down to Nandideva and he, to Siddhars. Therefore it is 
called 'Saiva Sampradayam' (tradition of Shive), or 'Siddha Sampradayam'. In the case of 
Ayurveda it was Brahma, the Creator of the Universe, who taught the science to Prajapati, he to 
Aswini Devatas and they, in their turn, to Atreya etc. So this tradition is called the Brahma or 
Arsha Sampradaya (the tradition of Rishis). The inference to be drawn from these traditions is 
that, there is no exact point of time to which the beginning of these systems could be traced. 
They are eternal, without a beginning or end; they began with man. 
 
Origin of Siddha Medicine: Siddha system is one of the oldest systems of medicine in India. 
The term ‘Siddha’ means achievement and the ‘Siddhars’ were saintly figures who achieved 
results in medicine through the practice of Yoga. Eighteen ‘Siddhars’ seem to have contributed 
towards the development of this medical system. Siddha system’s literature is in Tamil and it is 
practiced in Tamil speaking parts of India. The system is also called Agasthyar system in the 
name of its famous exponent sage Agasthya. A number of medical works of this system are 
ascribed to him but it may be difficult at this time to say the exact number that can be credited to 
him. This system of medicine developed within the Dravidian culture, which is of the pre-vedic 
period. The Siddha system is largely therapeutic in nature. 
The Siddhars: The ancient Tamils in their quest for knowledge for longevity developed two 
ways by which man can achieve mastery over nature. One is the Yogic way and the other is 
through medicines. The persons who dedicated themselves to this task were themselves great 
yogis known as Siddhars. Hence the system of medicine propounded by them came out be 
known as Siddhars system of Medicine.  
The Neem Tree: The Neem tree was regarded as sacred in Mohenjo-daro Civilization. In the 
annals of the ancient Siddha System of Medicine, the first medicinal plant mentioned as well as 
found a place, in ancient Tamil literature is Margosa or Neem. This has been used by Tamils 
97

from time immemorial as a deterrent for smallpox and other infectious diseases and also 
considered to possess powers to ward off evil spirits.  
Kalpa Treatment: Ancient Siddha devoted time in finding out suitable remedies rather than 
describing the causes of a disease in detail. The scope of ‘Kaya Kalpa’ treatment is two-fold; 
one is to cure degenerative diseases and the other is to prolong the life span. Kalpa serves as 
an anti-degenerative elixir -- that can cure cancer and heart diseases is itself rejuvenation.

Medical Education in Ancient India: Medicinal knowledge has been systematized thousands 
of years ago in a system of medicine called Ayurveda. Ayurveda is a Sanskrit word, derived 
from two roots: ayur, which means life, and veda, knowledge. It has its root in ancient Vedic 
literature and encompasses our entire life, the body, mind and spirit. In ancient India, Medical 
education was available in in the larger cities such as Taxila, Kasi (Varanasi) and Nalanda. The 
plant wealth of forest was utilized through ‘Ayurveda’ for the welfare of human beings. The city 
of Ayodhya was inhabited by a good number of vaidyas or physicians. Proficient and 
skilled surgeons known as ‘salyakrt’ (v. 28.6) existed at the time of Ramayana. 
Physicians accompanied royal well developed and surgeons were in special demand. 
Surgeons of the structure of the human body as can be inferred from the many 
anatomical terms used in the epic. 
 
Relevance of medicinal plants today 
The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated that 80 % of the population of 
developing countries still relies on traditional medicines, mostly plant drugs, for their primary 
health care needs. Also, modern pharmacopoeia contains at least 25% drugs derived from 
plants. Many other are synthetic analogues built on prototype compounds isolated from plants. 
Demand for medicinal plant is increasing in both developing and developed countries due to 
growing recognition of natural products, being non-toxic, having no side-effects, easily available 
at affordable prices. There has been resurgence in the consumption and demand for medicinal 
plants. These plants are finding use as pharmaceuticals, neutraceuticals, cosmetics and food 
supplements. According to an all India ethno-biological survey carried out by the Ministry of 
Environment and Forests, Government of India, there are over 8000 species of plants being 
used for medicine in India.

15 . Role of cattle and other domestic animals- management of cattle for draught 
and milk – indigenous breeds 
India has a distinguished livestock heritage and a place of pride in the history of livestock 
development in the world. It has shared its livestock resources with many countries all over the 
world, thus contributing immensely to livestock development on a global scale. It ranks first in 
cattle and buffalo population with 15% and 52% respectively and together making up 28% of the 
large ruminant population of the world. Likewise, India ranks first in goat population (19%) and 
fifth in sheep population (45%), the two together making up 26% of small ruminant population of 
the world. India has the largest number of breeds of cattle (26), buffaloes (7), goats (20), and 
sheep (40) in the world. Thus livestock wealth of India constitutes the richest livestock bank of 
the world. In India the zebu are much prized for their heat tolerance, disease resistance, and 
capacity to thrive under harsh environments. They have been exported to countries in Asia. 
Africa, the Americas, and Australia, where they have adapted well.  
Animals are sources of food, fibre, power, manure, hides. skins, bones, and recreation. 
Besides being an integral part of agriculture and rural life. their contribution to the national 
income is invaluable. The contribution of animal husbandry is 26.4% and that of the latter is 
36% of the gross national product. The annual growth rate of animal husbandry is 6.2% and that 
of agriculture is 3.42%. Thus the growth rate of livestock products in India has been comparable 
to that achieved by any other important sectors of economy. Today, the country ranks first in 
milk production in the world.  
The present glory of animal husbandry has a long historical background. The history of 
animal husbandry is interwoven with the progress of agriculture and ultimately the progress of 
civilization. In developing crop husbandry, man learned to supplement his own capabilities with

that of domestic animals. The importance of livestock was well known since time immemorial. In 
prehistoric and ancient India animal husbandry has been an integral part of agriculture. Written 
documents and old civilization manifestations suggest that animal husbandry in ancient and 
medieval India was of high order. Several references exist on importance of livestock and their 
rearing; e.g., Vedas, Upanishads, Ramayana, Mahabharata, Buddhist and Jain literature, 
Kautilya’s Artha-sastra. Puranas, Krishi-Parashara. and Ain-i-Akbari. According to some 
scholars the Vedas are dated 5000-3000 BC, Puranas 2000-1000 BC, and Artha-sastra 300-
600 AD; Ramayana is considered 9000 years old, Mahabharata 5000 years old, and Jain and 
Buddhist literature about 2500 years old.  
Domestication of animals  
Dog, a domestic pet, was the first animal to be domesticated in the Old Stone Age (10,000 
BC) and other farm animals were domesticated in the New Stone Age (7500-6500 BC). 
Different animals have been domesticated in different periods in Europe, Central and West Asia, 
and India. It is considered that horse, cow, sheep and goat were domesticated first in Europe 
and Asia. pig in China. and poultry, elephant, and buffalo in India. The order of domestication 
was dog. goal. sheep. cow, buffalo, pig, elephant. horse. camel. and ass. However. evidence 
from Mohenjo-daro excavation amply suggests that indigenous breeds of cattle had originated 
in India and not brought by Aryans in India. The present-day cattle of Sind, Gujarat, and 
Rajputana are similar to those that existed in Mohenjo-daro.   
Animal husbandry in Vedic literature  
Many uses of animals and birds for the human society arc mentioned in the Vedas. These 
include food items such as milk and milk products; medicines from milk, ghee (clarified butter), 
and urine of cows; wool; skin and hides; manure; and fuel and animal power in agriculture and 
transportation. The sound of animals and birds are indicators of future events such as rains, 
lightning. and earthquakes; presence of poisons in food; and location of lurking dangerous 
101

animals. Therefore, Vedas have directed to raise and protect animals.  
Cow is referred as “aghnya” which means not to be killed but to be raised and protected. 
Likewise, Vedas have directed to protect other animals too. A lot of emphasis has been given to 
rearing and protecting cows as they produce milk and manure (dung and urine), and bullocks for 
draught power.   
The Aryans, in the Vedic Age, knew the importance of pasture and forests . They used to 
graze their cattle by taking them to the grasslands in the morning and bring them back in the 
evening.This practice still survives in villages all over India. A number of hymns in Vedas are 
addressed to God for gifts of cattle and other animals. The vocabulary of Aryans is rich in 
names for every aspect of herds with special words for cows with strange calves; a cow barren 
after calving; and red, black, and light coloured cows; also herds were differentiated by distinct 
names. Cuts in the ears were made for identification. The cows were milked three times daily 
suggesting their high milk-yielding capacity. Castration was practised and oxen were used for 
their normal purpose of farm transport:’Cows which gave abundant milk and which could be 
milked easily are prayed for. The quality of some cows which let down milk merely on the sight 
of their calves has been well observed and referred to.  
Avi, the Sanskrit word for sheep, is used by transference for wool. Sheep wool was mainly 
used but there is evidence of use of goat’s wool (hair) from long-haired animals such as those 
from Kashmir. The wool when spun was woven on a loom.   
Animal husbandry during 200-300 BC  
The Buddhist text (Suttanipata) declares cattle to be givers of food, beauty, and 
happinessand pleads their protection. There used to be superintendents of cows who 
supervised herds of milch cattle, cow herdsman, buffalo herdsman, milkers, and churners. The 
superintendent ensured that calves were not starved but fed well. The herds included equal 
number of milch cows, pregnant cows, aged cows, heifers, and calves. Crippled cows and cows 
102

difficult to milk were kept in special herds. The superintendent branded the cows to indicate that 
their calves were more than two months old. He registered them and also noted their natural 
marks, colour, and distance between horns. Thus herd registration and marking for identification 
was in practice. The cattle were allowed to graze in fields after harvesting of crops. However, 
during the cropping season they were sent under normal charge of a herdsman, hired by the 
village collectively, to grazing land. The herdsman knew each animal under his charge by 
general appearance and marks upon it. He was experienced in removing eggs of flies from their 
hide, to heal sores, knew places of availability of food and water, and clever in choosing 
pastures.  
Kautilya’s Artha-sastra also mentions importance of cows and states, ‘The killing of cows 
is a deadly sin.” The king will daily visit the cows, observe them, and salute both cows with her 
calf and bull by circling round them, before going to the court.  
In the Mauryan age, buffaloes were also recognized as dairy animals. The rations for 
buffaloes were prescribed. It is stated that buffalo milk is richer in butter fat than cow’s milk, the 
fact established very well today. Kautilya clearly mentions for providing breeding bulls in herds 
of cows.  
During the reign of Ashoka, veterinary hospitals were state institutions and functioned all 
over the empire. Herbs and medicinal plants used for healing ailments of beasts were grown 
and those lacking at a particular place were imported and planted. Thus, there was a provision 
for care and treatment of cattle, horses. and elephants.  
Animal husbandry in medieval India  
Abdur Razzak, a foreign visitor in South India, observed that Devendra II of Vijayanagar 
empire had many elephants. The king also had a white elephant. He described in detail the’ 
procedure for catching, taming, feeding, and breeding of elephants. Cows and oxen were not 
slaughtered in that empire but were worshipped on certain occasions. Mention has been made 
103

of Hallikar cattle breed which was poor in milk production but one of the best draught type cattle 
that was available in South India. Bullocks were strong and quick, covering 30-40 miles a day 
on rough road. In the field, the animal was fast and yet a steady worker, being useful for all 
types of cultivation. Males were castrated when broken to yoke, i.e., around 3 years. Giving a 
historical record, Kristnasamienger and Pease mentioned that the Hallikar cattle breed was 
taken to Mysore between 1500 and 1600 AD. It was bred and developed into Amritmahal breed.  
  
Akbar had 12000 horses in his stables. He collected horses from Iraq, Iran, Turkey, 
Arabia. Central Asia, and Tibel. Much attention was given to breeding of horses in Mughal India 
for which skilful and experienced men were kept. India ranked higher than Arabia in this regard 
writes Abul Fazal, Kachhi horses being equal to Arabian horses. Goat breeds of Bengal and 
Coach Bihar are also mentioned. Feed and fodder for horses were described; e.g., in winter 
boiled grains or vetch and in summer 2 seers (about 2 kg) flour, 1 1/2 seers jaggery. and fresh 
grass or hay feeding is suggested. It has heen mentioned to keep 3 bighas land for grass.  
 
Cattle of Gujarat were stated to be the best. Bullocks travelled 80 miles a day and some 
even surpassed horses. The life span of cow was stated to be 25 years. Various classes of 
cows have been mentioned, e.g. ‘Khas’ class and first class. Khas class were fed 61 1/4 seers 
grain and 1 1/2 dams grass whereas the other category was fed 3 seers grain and I dam grass. 
Molasses was also used for feeding. Female buffaloes were fed 8 seers wheat flour, 1/2 seer 
molasses, 1 1/2seers grain, and 2 dams grass. Milk yield of cows varied and was 1 - 15 seers 
day-1 and that of buffalo was 2-30 seers day-1. Buffaloes of Punjab were best. One man was 
kept for looking after 4 adult cattle with their followers.  
 
Thus it can be observed that importance of animals was very well known in ancient and 
104
Introductory Agriculture
www.AgriMoon.Com

medieval India. The husbandry of animals was well established. Norms of feeding, breeding, 
housing, and health care were also very wen established and practised. The present-day animal 
husbandry development is an outcome of the gradual enhancement in knowledge in this field for 
thousands of years.  
Dairy production systems  
In ancient India, number of cows that were kept by the people is amazing. There are 
instances that people possessed lakhs (one hundred thousand is one lakh) of cows and one 
King used to donate drive away the entire cow herd of other kings when there used to be any 
conflict between them. We can imagine that in such an endeavor the tremendous human power 
that would be required to drive away such a large herd from one place to another. This indicates 
that the number of animals in those days was far more than the total livestock population 
existing today. Not only this, the husbandry practices and grazing facilities for cows were very 
good and in abundance. Lord Krishna used to call his cows by name (a method of identification 
of animals). In Garg Sarnhita (Golok Khand) three titles, which used to be conferred upon 
persons possessing cowherds are mentioned below.  
Brakh - the person who reared 10 lakh (one million) cows,   
Nand - the person who reared 9 lakh cows,  
Upnand - the person who reared 5 lakh cows,  
The existing thumb rule of feeding concentrate ration to the animals was based on the 
feeding standards of ancient days, which by and large approximate to the present-day feeding 
standards of animals.  
Evidently, ancient India has thus remained traditionally a “dairying” country and the 
prosperity and social status of a person was judged not by the landholding but by the number of 
cows he possessed. Hence, the present day sciences by no means can estimate vast utility and 
purpose of cows, which our ancient visionaries had realized, propounded and established.

16 . Description of Indian civilization and agriculture by travelers from 
China, Europe and USA 
 
Indus valley civilization: Allchins, relying on Lambrick, who, according to them, had personal 
knowledge of Sind, describe as follows how crops were grown in the riverain tract of the Indus. 
"The principal food grains, that is wheat and barley, would have been grown as spring (rabi) 
crops: that is to say, sown at the end of the inundation upon land which had been submerged by 
spill from the river or one of its natural flood channels, and reaped in March or April.  
 
The Greek writers highly praised the fertility of Indian soil and favourable climate 
condition describing the principal agricultural products of the land.  
The Greek writers also affirm that India has a double rainfall and the Indians generally 
gather two harvests. - Megasthenes witnesses - the sowing of wheat in early, winter rains and of 
rice, 'bosporum', sesamum and millets in the summer solstice (Diodorus, II, 36). Megasthenes 
adds further to the winter crops, viz., "wheat, barley, pulse and other esculent fruits unknown to 
us". 
The Chinese pilgrim Hsieun Tsang who arrived at the monastic University of Nalanda in 630 
A.D. mentioned the gardening as: "The temple arose into the mists and the shrine halls stood 
high above the clouds . . . streams of blue water wound through the parks; green lotus flowers 
sparkled among the blossoms of sandal trees and a mango grove spread outside the 
enclosure."  
 
Protection of cultivators:  Sher Shah had genuine concern for the peasantry and safety of 
their crops. One of the regulations made by Sher shah was this: That his victorious standards 
106
Introductory Agriculture

should cause no injury to the cultivations of the people; and when he marched he personally 
examined into the state of the cultivation, and stationed horsemen round it to prevent people 
from trespassing on any one`s field. As regards the peasantry and their condition, there is 
reliable evidence in the observations of the European travellers who travelled in India in the 
seventeenth century.  
 
 
Evidence of the structure of the Mughal gardens and plants grown in them is in the Persian 
classics illustrated during the reign of Akbar. Among them is Diwan-i-Anwari, a collection of 
poems by the Persian poet Anwari, who flourished in the latter part of twelfth century. It contains 
some excellent paintings on gardens and gardening. Abu-l-Fazl mentions three kinds of 
sugarcane, viz. paunda, black and ordinary. Abu-l-Fazl provides a list of twenty-one fragrant 
flowering plants along with the colour of their flowers and the season of flowering in the Ain-
iAkbari.  
 
Terry, an English traveler, writes, ‘The country was abounding with musk-melons.  One could 
also find water-melons, pomegranates, lemons, oranges, dates, figs, grapes, coconut, plantains, 
mangoes, pineapples, pears, apples, etc.’ Terry also mentions the use of coffee by some 
people.  He writes, ‘Many religious people drank a “wholesome liquor” which they called coffee.  
Black seeds were boiled in water, which also become black. It altered the taste of water very 
little.  It quickened the spirit and cleansed the blood.  
 
Francois Bernier: Of the European travelers who come to India during the Mughal rule, the 
most intelligent and learned was Francois Bernier a Frenchman. Bernier gives a vivid 
description of Bengal its landscape people and its plant and animals products. With extensive 
107

fields of rice, sugar, corn, three or four sorts of vegetables, mustured, seasems for oils and 
small mulberry trees two or three feet (61 to 91 cm) in height, for the food of silk worms.  
 
Meadows Taylor states “The Bahmanis constructed irrigation works in the eastern provinces, 
which incidentally did good to the peasantry while primarily securing the crown revenue. 
Vincent Smith points out that those items to their credit weigh lightly against the wholesale 
devastation wrought by their credit weight lightly against the wholesale devastation wrought by 
their wars, massacres, and burnings. Their rule was harsh and showed little regard for the 
welfare of Hindu peasants, who were seldom allowed to retain the fruits of their labour much 
more than would suffice to keep body and soul together. 
 
Herodotus (484-425 BC) the father of history reported in his writings that the wild Indian 
(cotton) trees possessed in their fruits fleeces, superseding those of sheep in beauty and 
excellence from which the natives used to weave cloth. Herodotus further wrote that “trees 
which grow wild in India and the fruit of which bear wool exceeding in beauty and fineness that 
of sheep wool Indians make their clothes with this tree wool”. Some traveller writers fabricated 
stories of a lamb sitting inside the fruit. Marco Pola, a Venetian, who traveled widely throughout 
the Asia in AD 1290 said that the coast of Coromandel (Madras, India) produced the finest and 
most beautiful cotton in the world. Indian cloth, particularly the Dacca muslin was renowned all 
over the world and has been described as ‘webs of woven wind’ by oriental poets. It was so fine 
that it could hardly be felt in the hands. It is said that when such muslins were laid on the grass 
to bleach and the dew had fallen, it was no longer visible. A whole garment made from it could 
be drawn through a wedding ring of medium size. There is also the often repeated tale of 
Moghul princes who put on seven layers of muslin and still the contours of her body were so 
visible that she had to be admonisher by her father, Muhamed Bin Thuklak.

17. OUR JOURNEY IN AGRICULTURE AND VISION FOR THE FUTURE 
 
The famine from 1876-78 led to institution of Famine Commission of 1880. The horrors 
of Famine (1889-90) convinced Lord Curzon that urgent attention must be paid agriculture. Lord 
Curzon passed the Land Alienation Act (1900) and Cooperative Societies Act   (1904).  Lord 
Curzon, the Viceroy of India with the generous donations from Henry Phipps of the USA had 
founded the Imperial Agriculture Research Institute in 1905 at Pusa, a village in the Darabhanga 
district of Bihar.  The main building at Pusa was named after its donor as the Phipps Laboratory. 
[PUSA stands for the donor of the Institute, Phipps of the USA].  There was a disastrous 
earthquake in 1936 and Pusa suffered heavily. After careful consideration the Government of 
India rebuilt the institute at New Delhi. The transfer to New Delhi was completed by October, 
1936. The Marquees of Linlithgo, the then Viceroy of India, opened this Institutes in November, 
1936. This Institute  (IARI) in Delhi is popularly known as the Pusa Institute. Under the 
University Grants Commission Act 1956, the Institute (at New Delhi ) got the status of the 
Deemed University and Teaching and Research activities were intensified from 1958. In 1947, 
India had about 27 Agricultural and Veterinary Colleges including the Indian Agricultural 
Research Institutes, Indian Veterinary Research Institute and five other Agricultural Colleges 
established during the first decade of the century.  
 
Agriculture Colleges were started at Poona (Pune) and Kanpur. Teaching was the main 
mandate. The Indian Central Cotton Committee (ICCC) (1921) was formed as per 
recommendation of the Indian Central Cotton Commission (1917-18). 
 
The Government of India appointed a Royal Commission in 1926 to examine the 
condition of agricultural and rural economy in India. The Imperial Council of Agricultural 
109
Introductory Agriculture
www.AgriMoon.Com

Research (ICAR) was established in 1929 as a Society under the Societies Registration Act, 
1860. The Society was registered on July 16, 1929. [After Independence, the name of the 
society was changed to Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)]. The food crisis created 
by the Second World War and the Bengal famine in 1943 deepened and became the matters of 
great concern to Government of India. To meet the food shortage the Grow More Food 
campaign was started in 1943. 
 
The Indian Central Coconut Committee and the Indian Central Tobacco Committee were 
formed in 1945. The Indian Central Arecanut Committee was formed in 1949 and the Indian 
Central Spices and Cashewnut Committee were formed in 1958. Regional stations\sub-station 
on cotton, Jowar, Finger millet, setaria, castor, groundnut, linseed, bajra were established and 
the PIRRCOM (Project for Identification of Regional Research on Cotton, Oilseeds and Millets) 
were started.  
 
All India Coordinated Research Projects: The AICRPs were born from the coordinated 
project on maize developed with the Rockefeller Foundation's assistance in 1957, ICAR has 
now about 70 All India Coordinated Research projects covering various disciplines and 
commodity crops, livestock, fisheries, home science, and agricultural engineering. An AICRP 
enables effective utilization of the resources in man and material anywhere in the country to 
tackle some of the important national problems.  
 
ICAR Institutes: The ICAR is directly responsible for administering 32 research institutes in the 
fields of agriculture, animal sciences and fisheries. Some of these are single commodity-
oriented crop institutions while a few of them undertake work on a number of crops. The Indian 
Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi, the Indian Veterinary Research Institute 
(IVRI), Izatnagar, and the National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI), Karnal are the three 
110
Introductory Agriculture
www.AgriMoon.Com

national institutions which have responsibilities both for research and post-graduate education. 
The recent establishment of the National Academy of Agricultural Management at Hyderabad as 
a constituent unit of the Council is an important landmark in institution building. This Academy 
would be responsible for providing quality training to various categories of personnel involved in 
agricultural research all over the country. Establishment of an Agricultural Research Service 
(ARS) started on October 1st, 1975 marks yet another landmark in the history of research 
management of ICAR. 
 
Agricultural Universities: The responsibility for research in most of the States is now with the 
21 agricultural universities, which perform in an integrated way the functions of teaching, 
research and extension education. The ICAR has recently taken major steps to further 
strengthen the agricultural research capabilities of the agricultural universities through the 
National Agricultural Research Project (NARP), which is being implemented through the 
assistance of IBRD. 
 
Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs): The ICAR has sponsored a programme known as the Krishi 
Vigyan  Kendras, designed to provide skill oriented vocational training to practicing  farmers, in-
service field level extension Workers or those who intend to go in for  self-employment.

VISION FOR AGRICULTURE IN 2020 AD 
 
President APJ Abdul Kalam in 2003 opined that that there is need for India to launch a new 
vision, which he called "Vision - 2020". To achieve this, they should concentrate on two 
mantras: Effective Implementation with People’s Participation; and Effective Communication for 
People’s Participation. A key element of "Vision 2020" would be "Providing Urban amenities in 
Rural Areas (PURA)". The Biological Diversity Bill 2002, passed in the Winter Session, marked 
a major milestone in India’s commitment to conservation and sustainable utilization of our bio-
resources.  
 
 
Agricultural Research in India  
 
The research thrust areas identified for immediate future are: 
 
i. 
Increasing the productivity of crops 
 
ii. 
Micro-propagation of agricultural and horticultural plants though tissue culture 
techniques, biotechnology, etc. 
 
iii. 
Forage crops for various agroclimatic regions

Agricultural Extension in India 
The farming community needs to increase their productivity through the mission Second 
Green Revolution using technological advances. Also dry land cultivation needs a thrust. The 
technology is the base item for the action plan to bring India into a developed nation in reality. 
Grooming ‘technology’ from seed up to a fruit-bearing tree is an art, science and a specialised 
enterprise in itself. The key to success lies in assessing where, when and how to facilitate entry 
for money in the process of technological project realization. There are many other prior 
activities, which need to be done if technology development can mature into a good business 
activity. Another important development was that in addition to rapid spreading of interest within 
the actual farmers, the whole community (in the benefited areas) got involved. For example, a 
women ‘Self Help Group’ is being formed for certain joint cooperative efforts for better quality of 
life.  
 
Farmers get considerable earnings (and substantial returns on their investment in Agro 
processing) per hectare. Stabilizing the agro technologies for the well chosen (market share 
wise) medicinal herbs and placing them in the correct places of value chain. Ever since the 
Agreement on Agriculture of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) began to be debated in the 
114
Introductory Agriculture
www.AgriMoon.Com

country, increasing agricultural productivity and improving food quality are being tossed as the 
only solutions for farmers' survival. Invariably, at every conference and seminar on WTO, the 
common refrain is that farmers are left with no choice but to increase productivity and thereby 
reduce the cost of production to remain competitive in a globalised world. The productivity bug 
has bitten not only the agricultural scientists but also the policy-makers, planners and, of course, 
the politicians.  
 
India’a Agricultural Heritage Status in Press 
World heritage status for India’s farming techniques - The Hindu, FEB 13, 2010 
India’s locally developed farming techniques look set to take their place on the world 
heritage map alongside the country’s national parks of outstanding beauty and its grand 
monuments to culture. 
The rice crop of Koraput, the salt water farms of Kuttanad, and the paddy fields of 
Thanjavur could join the likes of Konarak, Kaziranga and the Taj Mahal, under an 
initiative of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) designed to safeguard 
unique agricultural systems in an era of climate change. 
“These sites are protecting our food security. They are our heritage… The techniques 
were developed by farmers, not by scientists or anything else. The technology is their 
own,” said M.S. Swaminathan, Chairman MSSRF, who was speaking to reporters 
ahead of an international conference on biodiversity at the Research Foundation next 
week. 
Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) are regions of outstanding 
biodiversity that reflect the natural evolution of farming and may help provide natural 
solutions to changing climates in the future. 
Orissa’s Koraput region, India’s first candidate for GIAHS status, has been nominated 
for the variety of rice, millets, pulses, and medicinal plants developed using traditional 
cultivation practices by tribal groups. 
115

Papers for Kuttanad in Allapuzha, Kerala, where farmers have produced crops in sea 
water, have been submitted to the FAO and the 2,000-year-old system of irrigating 
paddy in Thanjavur should follow, Dr. Ajay Parida, Executive Director, MSSRF said. 
Thus far, systems from just five countries have been identified as GIAHS: Andean 
agriculture in Peru, Chiloe agriculture in Chile, the Ifuago rice terraces of the 
Philippines, the Magreb Oases in Algeria and the Upland pastures that cross the 
borders of Kenya and Tanzania 
Kudos for Koraputs Agricultural Heritage - Indian Express Jan 08, 2012 
 
United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has recognised the 
efforts of the tribal community of Koraput to conserve biodiversity and develop climate 
resilient farm practices as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS). 
✤The recognition of the Koraput traditional agricultural system as a GIAHS site is 
expected to guarantee local and international efforts for the conservation of biodiversity 
and sustainable use of its genetic resources. 
✤GIAHS is defined as a remarkable land use systems and landscapes which are rich in 
globally significant biological diversity evolving from the co-adaptation of a community 
with its environment and its needs and aspirations for sustainable development. 
✤Mentioning this at the inauguration of the 99th Indian Science Congress here, Prime 
Minister Manmohan Singh lauded the Koraput tribals for the achievement. 
✤The Koraput region is famous for its rich agricultural biodiversity of global importance. 
The agro-biodiversity recorded in the Koraput region includes, 340 landraces of paddy, 
eight species of minor millets, nine species of pulses, five species of oilseeds, three 
species of fibrous plants and seven species of vegetables. 
✤The Jeypore region is rich in genetic resources of medicinal plants. More than 1,200 
medicinal plant species are available there. Some of the endemic plant species of the 
region are used for curing different diseases including gastrointestinal disorders, malaria 
and bone fracture. 
✤The tribal groups have rich traditional knowledge about forest species too. It is also 
seen as the recognition of tribal people’s contribution to biodiversity and knowledge 
systems, whilst increasing attention to their natural and cultural heritage. 
✤The genetic diversity of Asian cultivated rice has been considered as the centre of 
origin of aus ecotype of rice. The landraces or traditional varieties growing here are 
116

thought to be harbouring dominant genes for biotic and abiotic stresses, aroma and 
palatability, and hold promise for their utilisation in future plant breeding and 
biotechnology programmes, an FAO official said. 
✤The tribal and rural families of this area have been developing and conserving these 
genetic resources from time immemorial with their traditional knowledge. Today’s 
landraces, evolved naturally with the changing environment and agricultural practices, 
are the products of careful and continuous selection by tribal women and men, whose 
merits have not yet received the recognition they deserve, he said.

Agriculture  
 
 
The term Agriculture is derived from two Latin words ager or agri meaning soil and cultura 
meaning cultivation. Agriculture is an applied science which encompasses all aspects of crop 
production including horticulture, livestock rearing, fisheries, forestry, etc.  
 
 
Agriculture is defined as an art, science and business of producing crops  and livestock  
for economic purposes. 
 
 
As an art it embraces knowledge of the way to perform the operations of the farm in a 
skillful manner, but does not necessarily include an understanding of the principles underlying the 
farm practices.  
 
As a science: utilizes all technologies developed on scientific principles such as crop 
breeding, production techniques, crop protection, economics etc. to maximize the yield and profit. 
For example, new crops and varieties developed by hybridization, Transgenic crop varieties resistant 
to pests and diseases, hybrids in each crop, high fertilizer responsive varieties, water management, 
herbicides to control weeds, use of bio-control agents to combat pest and diseases etc.  
 
 
As the business: As long as agriculture is the way of life of the rural population production is 
ultimately bound to consumption. But agriculture as a business aims at maximum net return through 
the management of land labour, water and capital, employing the knowledge of various sciences for 
production of food, feed, fibre and fuel. In recent years, agriculture is commercialized to run as a 
business through mechanization. 
 
 
AGRICULTURE is defined in the Agriculture act (1947), as including ‘horticulture, fruit 
growing, seed growing, dairy farming and livestock breeding and keeping, the use of land as grazing 
land, meadow land, osier land, market gardens and nursery grounds, and the use of land for 
woodlands where that use ancillary to the farming of land for Agricultural purposes”. 
 
SCOPE AND IMPORTANCE OF AGRICULTURE IN INDIA AND TAMILNADU 
 
 With a 16% contribution to the gross domestic product (GDP), agriculture still provides 
livelihood support to about two-thirds of country's population.  
 The sector provides employment to 58% of country's work force and is the single largest private 
sector occupation.  
 Agriculture accounts for about 15% of the total export earnings and provides raw material to a 
large number of Industries (textiles, silk, sugar, rice, flour mills, milk products).  
 Rural areas are the biggest markets for low-priced and middle-priced consumer goods, including 
consumer durables and rural domestic savings are an important source of resource mobilization.   
 The agriculture sector acts as a wall in maintaining food security and in the process, national 
security as well.  
 The allied sectors like horticulture, animal husbandry, dairy and fisheries, have an important role 
in improving the overall economic conditions and health and nutrition of the rural masses.  
 To maintain the ecological balance, there is need for sustainable and balanced development of 
agriculture and allied sectors.

 Agriculture’s eyes and minds are soothed by dynamic changes from brown (bare soil) to green 
(growing crop) to golden (mature crop) and bumper harvests. 
 Plateauing of agricultural productivity in irrigated areas and in some cases the declining trend 
warrants attention of scientists. 
 
Agriculture helps to elevate the community consisting of different castes and communities to 
a better social, cultural, political and economical life. Agriculture maintains a biological equilibrium 
in nature. Satisfactory agricultural production brings peace, prosperity, harmony, health and wealth 
to individuals of a nation by driving away distrust, discord and anarchy. 
 
REVOLUTIONS IN AGRICULTURE 
 
Through white revolution, milk production quadrupled from 17 million tonnes at 
independence to 108.5 million tonnes. 
 
Through blue revolution, fish production rose from 0.75 million tonnes to nearly 7.6 million 
tonnes during the last five decades. 
 
Through yellow revolution oil seed production increased 5 times (from 5 million tonnes to 25 
million tonnes) since independence. 
 
Similarly, the egg production increased from 2 billion at independence to 28 billion, 
sugarcane production from 57 million tonnes to 282 million tonnes, cotton production from 3 
million bales to 32 million bales which shows our sign of progress. 
 
India is the largest producer of fruits in the world. India is the second largest producer of milk 
and vegetable. 
 
BRANCHES OF AGRICULTURE 
 
Seven branches viz., 
1. 
Agronomy  
2. 
Horticulture 
3. 
Forestry 
4. 
Animal husbandry 
5. 
Fishery science 
6. 
Agricultural Engineering and 
7. 
Home science 
 
1) Agronomy – Deals with the production of various crops which includes food crops, fodder crops, 
fibre crops, sugar, oilseeds, etc.  The aim is to have better food production and how to control 
the diseases. 
2) Horticulture - Deals with the production of fruits, vegetables, flowers, ornamental plants, spices, 
condiments and beverages. 
3) Forestry – Deals with production of large scale cultivation of perennial trees for supplying wood, 
timber, rubber, etc. and also raw materials for industries. 
4) Animal husbandry – Deals with agricultural practice of breeding and raising livestock in order to 
provide food for humans and to provide power (draught) and manure for crops.  
5) Fishery science – Deals with practice of breeding and rearing fishes including marine and inland 
fishes, shrimps, prawns etc. in order to provide food, feed and manure. 
6) Agricultural Engineering – Deals with farm machinery for filed preparation, inter-cultivation, 
harvesting and post harvest processing including soil and water conservation engineering and 
bio-energy.   
7) Home Science – Deals with application and utilization of agricultural produces in a better manner 
in order to provide nutritional security, including value addition and food preparation.  
On integration, all the seven branches, first three is grouped as for crop production group and 
next two animal management and last two allied agriculture branches.

Evolution of man and Agriculture  
 
There are different stages in development of agriculture, which is oriented with human 
civilization. They are Hunting  Pastoral  Crop culture  Trade (stages of human civilization). 
1. Hunting – It was the primary source of food in old days. It is the important occupation and it 
existed for a very long period. 
2. Pastoral – Human obtained his food through domestication animals, e.g. dogs, horse, cow, 
buffalo, etc. They lived in the periphery of the forest and they had to feed his domesticated animals.  
For feeding his animals, he would have migrated from one place to another in search of food.  It was 
not comfortable and they might have enjoyed the benefit of staying in one place near the river bed. 
3. Crop culture -  By living near the river bed, he had enough water for his animals and 
domesticated crops and started cultivation.  Thus he has started to settle in a place.  
4. Trade – When he started producing more than his requirement the excess was exchanged, this is 
the basis for trade.  When agriculture has flourished, trade developed.  This lead to infrastructure 
development like road, routes, etc.   
 
Agriculture became civilized from crop culture stage.  Some important events for different 
periods that lead to development of scientific agriculture.

DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENTIFIC AGRICULTURE IN WORLD  
Experimentation technique was started (1561 to 1624) by Francis Bacon. He conducted an 
experiment and found that water is the principle requirement for plant.  If the same crop is cultivated 
for many times fertility is lost.   
Jan Baptiste Van Helmont (1572-1644) was actually responsible for conducting a pot 
experiment.  The experiment is called as ‘willow tree experiment’.  He took a willow tree of weight 5 
pounds.  He planted in a pot and the pot contained 200 pounds of soil and continuously monitored 
for five years by only watering the plant.  By the end of 5th year, the willow tree was weighing 16 
pounds.  The weight of soil is 198 pounds.  He concluded that water is the sole requirement for 
plants.  The conclusion was erroneous.   
In the 18th century, Arthur Young (1741-1820) published ‘Annals of Agriculture’.

In the beginning of 19th century,  scientist Jean Senebier (1742-1809), a Swiss naturalist, a 
historian, gave explanation that increase in the weight of plant was due to the consumption of air.  
Theodar Desaussure gave the principle theme of photosynthesis.  
Liebig is a German scientist and considered as the ‘Father of agricultural chemistry’.  It was 
his opinion that the growth of plant was proportional to the amount of mineral substances available 
in the soil. This is called as ‘Liebig law of minimum’. 
 
Chronological events in scientific agriculture 
 
Francis Bacon (1561-1624 A.D) 
Found the water as nutrient of plants 
G.R.Glanber (1604-1668 A.D) 
Salt peter(KNO3) as nutrient and not water 
Jethrotull (1674-1741 A.D) 
Fine soil particle as plant nutrient 
Priestly (1730-1799 A.D) 
Discovered the oxygen 
Francis Home (1775 A.D) 
Water, air, salts, fire and oil form the plant nutrients 
Thomas Jefferson (1793 AD)

Theodore de-Saussure 
Found that plants absorb CO2  from air  & release O2; soil

Justus van Liebig (1804- 1873) 
German chemist developed “law of minimum ” 
 
Advances in Agriculture in 19th Century 
• Following Liebig, an agricultural experiment station was started in Rothamsted in England on 
1843 (Old Permanent Manurial Experiment – OPME), it dealt with nutrients.  Subsequently 
many developments took place.  In U.S. land grant colleges was started in 19th century.  Its 
objective was to meet the expenditure of the college from the land around the colleges.  USDA 
(United States Department of Agriculture) is responsible for the introduction of herbicides 2,4-D 
and tractor combine for harvesting and threshing.  Under Land Grant College, agriculture 
oriented teaching, research, extension are expanded.  Many international research institutes were 
started for a specific crop.  
• 1857–Michigan State University was established to provide agricultural education at college 
level. 
• Gregor Mendal (1866) discovered the laws of hereditary. 
• Charles Darwin (1876) published the results of experiments on cross and self fertilization in 
plants. 
• Thomas Malthus (1898) proposed Malthusian Theory – states that humans would run-out of food 
for everyone inspite of rapid advance in agriculture due to limited land and yield potential of 
crops (i.e food may not be sufficient in future for the growing population at this current rate of 
growth in agriculture) 
• Blackman (1905) theory of “optima and limiting factors” states that when a process is 
conditioned as to it’s rapidity by a number of separate factors , the rate of the process is limited 
by the pace of the slowest factor” 
• Mitscherlich (1909) proposed the theory of law of diminishing returns that increase in growth 
with each successive addition of the limiting element is progressively smaller and the response is 
curvilinear. 
• Wilcox (1929) proposed “inverse yield nitrogen law”. It states that the growth or the yielding 
ability of any crop plant is inversely proportional to the mean nitrogen content in the dry matter.

DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENTIFIC AGRICULTURE IN INDIA 
 
Scientific agriculture got momentum in the 19th century itself.  Indian Land Tax was levied in 
the middle of 19th century.  In 1877, 1878, 1889, 1892, 1897 and 1900, the population was decreased 
due to continuous famines.  Only due to these famines, the British regime started many development 
programmes.  Lord Dalhousie (1848-1856) period the ‘Upper Bari Doab Canal’ in Punjab was 
constructed.  Improvement of agriculture started only in his period. In Lord Curzon’s (1898-1905) 
period, the ‘Great Canal system of Western Punjab’ was constructed.  During his period Imperial 
Agricultural Research Institute was started in Pusa in Bihar.  His period is called as ‘Golden period 
of agriculture’.  During his regime, Department of Agriculture and Agricultural colleges for 
provinces were started at Coimbatore in 1906. 
Due to earthquake at IARI in Pusa, Bihar it was shifted to New Delhi.  In 1926, Royal 
Commission on Agriculture was setup and was responsible for giving recommendation to dug canals, 
lay roads, etc.  Based upon the recommendation of Royal Commission, ICAR (Imperial Council of 
Agricultural Research) was started in 1929 with the objective to conduct agriculture research. State 
Agricultural Universities (SAU) were started after 1960s).  ICAR had also started research institutes 
of its own in different centres in India for various crops. 
ICAR is the sole body, which controls all the Agricultural Research Institutes in India.  It 
paved way for green revolution in India.  After 1947, ICAR totally adapted to Land Grant Colleges.  
In 1962, a Land Grant College was started in Pantnagar (UP).  It is the first university with 16,000 
acres. 
There are 45 state agricultural universities with research institutes on its own.  High yielding 
wheat varieties like Kalyansona, Sonalika, Lerma roja and Sonara-64 were introduced.  Green 
revolution took in wheat first, next in rice after the invention of Indo-Japanica variety.  Today, 
agricultural research is multi-dimensional.  In includes tissue culture, biotechnology besides 
breeding, crop production and crop protection.

Indian agriculture - Indian economy – National income – per capita income – Agricultural 
income in GDP - Women in agriculture and empowerment 
Indian Agriculture and Economy: 
Indian Agriculture is one of the most significant contributors to the Indian economy. 
Agriculture is the only means of living for almost 60% of the employed class in India. The 
agriculture sector of India has occupied almost 43% of India's geographical area. Agriculture is 
still the only largest contributor to India's GDP (16%) even after a decline in the same in the 
agriculture share of India. Agriculture also plays a significant role in the growth of socio-
economic sector in India. 
In the earlier times, India was largely dependent upon food imports, but the successive 
story of the agriculture sector of Indian economy has made it self-sufficing in grain production. 
The country also has substantial reserves for the same. India depends heavily on the agriculture 
sector, especially on the food production unit after the 1960 crisis in food sector. Since then, India 
has put a lot of effort to be self-sufficient in the food production and this endeavour of India has 
led to the Green Revolution. The Green Revolution came into existence with the aim to improve 
the agriculture in India. 
The services enhanced by the Green Revolution in the agriculture sector of Indian 
economy are as follows: 
• 
Acquiring more area for cultivation purposes 
• 
Expanding irrigation facilities 
• 
Use of improved and advanced high-yielding variety of seeds 
• 
Implementing better techniques that emerged from agriculture research 
• 
Water management 
• 
Plan protection activities through prudent use of fertilizers, pesticides. 
All these measures taken by the Green Revolution led to an alarming rise in the wheat and 
rice production of India's agriculture. Considering the quantum leap witnessed by the wheat and 
rice production unit of India's agriculture, a National Pulse Development Programme that covered 
almost 13 states was set up in 1986 with the aim to introduce the improved technologies to the 
farmers. A Technology Mission on Oilseeds was introduced in 1986 right after the success of 
National Pulse Development Programme to boost the oilseeds sector in Indian economy. Pulses 
too came under this programme. A new seed policy was planned to provide entree to superior 
quality seeds and plant material for fruits, vegetables, oilseeds, pulses and flowers. 
Lecture 02
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology

Page 11 of 200.

The Indian government also set up Ministry of Food Processing Industries to stimulate the 
agriculture sector of Indian economy and make it more lucrative. India's agriculture sector highly 
depends upon the monsoon season as heavy rainfall during the time leads to a rich harvest. But, 
the entire year's agriculture cannot possibly depend upon only one season. Taking into account this 
fact, a second Green Revolution is likely to be formed to overcome such restrictions. An increase 
in the growth rate and irrigation area, improved water management, improving the soil quality and 
diversifying into high value outputs, fruits, vegetables, herbs, flowers, medicinal plants and bio-
diesel are also on the list of the services to be taken by the Green Revolution to improve the 
agriculture in India. 
National income 
National Income is important because of the following reasons, 
• 
To see the economic development of the country.  
• 
To assess the developmental objectives.  
• 
To know the contribution of the various sectors to national income.  
Internationally some countries are wealthy, some countries are not wealthy and some 
countries are in-between. Under such circumstances, it would be difficult to evaluate the 
performance of an economy. Performance of an economy is directly proportionate to the amount 
of goods and services produced in an economy. Measuring national income is also important to 
chalk out the future course of the economy. It also broadly indicates people’s standard of living. 
Income can be measured by Gross National Product (GNP), Gross Domestic Product (GDP), 
Gross National Income (GNI), Net National Product (NNP) and Net National Income (NNI). 
The Indian economy is the 12th largest in USD exchange rate terms. India is the second fastest 
growing economy in the world. India’s GDP has touched US$1.25 trillion. The crossing of Indian 
GDP over a trillion dollar mark in 2007 puts India in the elite group of 12 countries with trillion 
dollar economy. The tremendous growth rate has coincided with better macroeconomic stability. 
India has made remarkable progress in information technology, high end services and knowledge 
process services. 
Agricultural income in GDP  
 
Agriculture sector contributed 32% in 1990-91, 20% during 2005-06 and around 16% now. 
Though the contribution of agriculture to the GDP income of India, it is great news that today the 
service sector is contributing more than half of the Indian GDP. It takes India one step closer to 
the developed economies of the world. Earlier it was agriculture which mainly contributed to the 
Indian GDP. The Indian government is still looking up to improve the GDP of the country and so

several steps have been taken to boost the economy. Policies of FDI, SEZs and NRI investment 
have been framed to give a push to the economy and hence the GDP. 
 Agriculture per capita income  
The per capita income of the agriculture sector declines to 1/3 of the national per capita 
income during the recent years. The per capita income of the agriculture population is estimated 
around Rs. 10,865 in 2010, which is around 32% of the national per capita income at Rs. 33,802/-. 
Per capita income of the agriculture population was around half (1/2) at Rs. 5,505 of the national 
per capita income at Rs. 11,433/- during 1980 however, it came down to around 42% at Rs. 
6,652/- of the national per capita income at Rs. 16,020/- during 2000.

Women in Agriculture and empowerment 
Women in India now participate in all activities such as education, sports, politics, media, 
art and culture, service sectors, science and technology, etc. Indira Gandhi, who served as Prime 
Minister of India for an aggregate period of fifteen years is the world's longest serving woman 
Prime Minister.  
The Constitution of India guarantees to all Indian women equality (Article 14), no 
discrimination by the State [Article 15(1)], equality of opportunity (Article 16) and equal pay for 
equal work [Article 39(d)]. In addition, it allows special provisions to be made by the State in 
favour of women and children [Article 15(3)], renounces practices derogatory to the dignity of 
women [Article 51(a) (e)], and also allows for provisions to be made by the State for securing just 
and humane conditions of work and for maternity relief. (Article 42).  
The feminist activism in India picked up momentum during later 1970s. Since alcoholism is often 
associated with violence against women in India, many women groups launched anti-liquor 
campaigns in Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and other 
states. Many Indian Muslim women have questioned the fundamental leaders' interpretation of 
women's rights under the Shariat law and have criticized the triple talaq system. 
In 1990s, grants from foreign donor agencies enabled the formation of new women-
oriented NGOs. Self-help groups and NGOs such as Self Employed Women's Association

(SEWA) have played a major role in women's rights in India. Many women have emerged as 
leaders of local movements. For example, Medha Patkar of the Narmada Bachao Andolan. 
The Government of India declared 2001 as the Year of Women's Empowerment 
(Swashakti). The National Policy for the Empowerment of Women came was passed in 2001.  
In 2006, the case of a Muslim rape victim called Imrana was highlighted in the media. 
Imrana was raped by her father-in-law. The pronouncement of some Muslim clerics that Imrana 
should marry her father-in-law led to widespread protests and finally Imrana's father-in-law was 
given a prison term of 10 years, The verdict was welcomed by many women's groups and the All 
India Muslim Personal Law Board.  
In 2010 March 9, one day after International Women's day, Rajyasabha passed Women's 
Reservation Bill, ensuring 33% reservation to women in Parliament and state legislative bodies. 
Women empowerment would become more relevant if women are educated, better 
informed and can take rational decisions. It is also necessary to sensitize the other sex towards 
women. It is important to usher in changes in societal attitudes and perceptions with regard to the 
role of women in different spheres of life. Adjustments have to be made in traditional gender 
specific performance of tasks. A woman needs to be physically healthy so that she is able to take 
challenges of equality. But it is sadly lacking in a majority of women especially in the rural areas. 
They have unequal access to basic health resources. 
Most of the women work in agricultural sector either as workers, in household farms or as 
wageworkers. Yet it is precisely livelihood in agriculture that has tended to become more volatile 
and insecure in recent years and women cultivators have therefore been negatively affected. The 
government's policies for alleviating poverty have failed to produce any desirable results, as 
women do not receive appropriate wages for their labour. There is also significant amount of 
unpaid or non-marketed labor within the household. The increase in gender disparity in wages in 
the urban areas is also quite marked as it results from the employment of women in different and 
lower paying activities. They are exploited at various levels. They should be provided with proper 
wages and work at par with men so that their status can be elevated in society. 
There is no doubt about the fact that development of women has always been the central 
focus of planning since Independence. Empowerment is a major step in this direction but it has to 
be seen in a relational context. A clear vision is needed to remove the obstacles to the path of 
women's emancipation both from the government and women themselves. Efforts should be 
directed towards all round development of each and every section of Indian women by giving 
them their due share.

Heritage is the inherited values carried from one generation to other generation  
Agricultural heritage refers to the values and traditional practices adopted in ancient 
India which are more relevant for   present day system. 
Agriculture Heritage in India 
 Agriculture in India is not of recent origin, but has a long history dating back to 
Neolithic age of 7500-6500 B.C. It changed the life style of early man from ‘nomadic 
hunter of wild berries and roots’ to ‘cultivator of land’. Agriculture is benefited from the 
wisdom and teachings of great saints. The wisdom gained and practices adopted have 
been passed down through generations. The traditional farmers have developed the nature 
friendly farming systems and practices such as mixed farming, mixed cropping, crop 
rotation etc. The great epics of ancient India convey the depth of knowledge possessed by 
the older generations of the farmers of India. The modern society has lost sight of the 
importance of the traditional knowledge which had been subjected to a process of 
refinement through generations of experience. The ecological considerations shown by 
the traditional farmers in their farming activities are now-a-days is reflected in the 
resurgence of organic agriculture.  
The available ancient literature includes the four Vedas (rig, yajur, sama, 
atharvana), nineteen Brahmanas (A total of 19 Brahmanas are extant at least in their 
entirety: two associated with the Rigveda, six with the Yajurveda, ten with the Samaveda 
and one with the Atharvaveda.), Aranyakas, Sutra literature, Susruta Samhita, Charaka 
Samhita, Upanishads, the epices Ramayana and Mahabharata, Puranas (20), Buddhist and 
Jain literature, and texts such as Krishi-Parashara, Kautilya’s Arthasastra, Panini’s 
Ashtadhyayi, Sangam literature of Tamils, Manusmirti (laws), Varahamihira’s Brihat 
Samhita (maths & astrology), Amarkosha, Kashyapiya-Krishisukti and Surapala’s 
Vriskshayurveda. This literature was most likely to have been composed between 6000

BC to 1000 AD. The information related to the biodiversity and agriculture (including 
animal husbandry) are available in these texts.  
Rigveda is the most ancient literary work of India. It believed that Gods were the 
foremost among agriculturists. According to Amarakosha (a thesaurus of Sanskrit written 
by the Jain or Buddhist scholar Amarasimha), Aryans were agriculturists. Manu and 
Kautilya prescribed agriculture, cattle rearing and commerce as essential subjects, which 
the king must learn. According to Patanjali (compiler of the Yoga Sūtras) the economy of 
the country depended on agriculture and cattle-breeding. Plenty of information is 
available in ‘Puranas’, which reveals that ancient Indians had intimate knowledge on all 
agricultural operations. Some of the well known ancient classics of India are namely, 
Kautilya's‘Arthashastra’; 
Panini's 
‘Astadhyayi’; 
Patanjali's 
‘Mahabhasya’; 
Varahamihira's ‘Brahat Samhita’; Amarsimha's ‘Amarkosha’ and Encyclopaedic works 
of Manasollasa. These classics testify the knowledge and wisdom of the people of ancient 
period. Technical books dealing exclusively with agriculture were Sage Parashara’s 
‘Krishiparashara’ in 1000 A.D. Other important texts are Agni Purana and Krishi Sukti 
attributed to Kashyap (500 A.D.). Ancient Tamil and Kannada works contain lot of useful 
information on agriculture in ancient India. Agriculture in India made tremendous 
progress in the rearing of sheep and goats, cows and buffaloes, trees and shrubs, spices 
and condiments, food and non-food crops, fruits and vegetables and developed nature 
friendly farming practices. These practices had social and religious undertones and 
became the way of life for the people. Domestic rites and festivals often synchronised 
with the four main agricultural operations of ploughing, sowing, reaping and harvesting.  
In the Rigveda, there is reference to hundreds and thousands of cows; to horses 
yoked to chariots; to race courses where chariot races were held; to camels yoked to the 
chariots; to sheep and goats offered as sacrificial victims, and to the use of wool for 
clothing. The famous Cow Sukta indicates that the cow had already become the very 
basis of rural economy. In another Sukta, she is defined as the mother of the Vasus, the 
Rudras and the Adityas, as also the pivot of Immortality. The Vedic Aryans appear to 
have large forests at their disposal for securing timber, and plants and herbs for medicinal 
purposes appear to have been reared by the physicians of the age, as appears in the 
Atharva Veda. The farmers' vocation was held in high regard, though agriculture solely

depended upon the favours of Parjanya, the god of rain. His thunders are described as 
food-bringing.  
The four Vedas mention more than 75 plant species, Satapatha Bhrahamna 
mentions over 25 species, and Charkaa Samhita (300 BC) an Aayurvedic (Indian 
medicine) treatise-mentions more than 320 plants. Susruta (400 BC) records over 750 
medicinal plant species. The oldest book, Rigveda (4000 BC) mentions a large number of 
poisonous and non poisonous aquatic and terrestrial, and domestic and wild creatures and 
animals. Puranas mention about 500 species of plants. The science of arbori-horticulture 
had developed well and has been documented in Surapala’s Vrikshayurveda. Forests 
were very important in ancient times. From the age of Vedas, protection of forests was 
emphasized for ecological balance. Kautilya in his Artha Sastra (321-296 BC) mentions 
that superintendent of forests had to collect forest produce through the forest guards. He 
provides a long list of trees, varieties, of bamboos, creepers, fibrous plants, drugs and 
poisons, skins of various animals, etc., that come under the purview of this officer.  
The preservation of wild animals was encouraged and hunting as a sport was 
regarded as detrimental to proper development of the character and personality of the 
ruler, according to Manu (Manusmriti, 2nd Century BC). Specifically, in the Puranas 
(300-750 AD) the names of Shalihotra on horses and Palakapya on elephants have been 
found as experts in animal husbandry. For instance, Garudapurana is a text dealing with 
treatment of animal disorders while the classical work on the treatment of horses is 
Aswashastra. One chapter in Agnipurana deals with the treatment of livestock and 
another on treatment of trees.

Stages of agriculture development - Era of civilization- Importance of Neolithic 
civilization 
Stages of agriculture development 
12000 to 9500 years ago 
• Hunters and food-gathers stage existed. 
• Stone implements (microliths) were seen throughout the Indian subcontinent. 
• Domestication of dog occurred in Iraq. 
• Earliest agriculture was by vegetative propagation (e.g., bananas, sugarcane, yam, 
sago, palms, and ginger). 
9500 to 7500 years ago 
• Wild ancestors of wheat and barley, goat, sheep, pig, and cattle were found. 
7500 to 5000years ago 
• Significant features were invention of plough, irrigated farming, use of wheel, and 
metallurgy and in Egypt, seed dibbling said to be practiced. 
5000to 4000years ago 
• Harappan culture is characterized by cultivation of wheat, barley and cotton; 
plough agriculture and bullocks for drought. Indus Valley is the home of cotton. 
• Wheeled carts were commonly used in the Indus valley. 
• Harappans not only grew cotton but also devised methods for ginning / spinning / 
weaving. 
4000 to 2000years ago 
• In North Arcot, bone / stone tools were found.  
• In Nevasa (Maharastra), copper and polished stone axes were used. First evidence 
of the presence of silk was found at this location. 
• At Navdatoli on Narmada river (Nemar, Madhya Pradesh), sickles set with stone 
teeth were used for cutting crop stalks. Crops grown were wheat, linseed, lentil, 
urd (black gram), mung bean, and khesari. 
• In Eastern India, rice, bananas, and sugarcane were cultivated. 
2000-1500 years ago 
• Tank irrigation was developed and practiced widely.

• Greek and Romans had trade with South India; pepper, cloth, and sandal wood 
were imported by Romans.  
• Chola King Karikala (190 AD) defeated Cheras and Pandyas, invaded Srilanka, 
captured 12000 men and used them as slaves to construct an embankment along 
the Cauvery, 160km along, to protect land from floods. He has built numerous 
irrigation tanks and promoted agriculture by clearing forests.  
1500-1000 years ago 
The Kanauj Empire of Harshavardhana (606-647 AD) 
• Cereals such as wheat, rice and millets, and fruits were extensively grown. A 60-
day variety and fragrant varieties of rice are mentioned. 
• Ginger, mustard, melons, pumpkin, onion, and garlic are also mentioned. 
• Persian wheel was used in Thanesar (Haryana). 
The kingdoms of South India 
• The kingdoms were of the Chalukyas (Badami), Rashtrakutas (Latur), Pallavas 
(Kanchi), Pandyas, Hoysals (Helebid), and Kakatiyas (Warangal). 
• Cholas ushered in a glorious phase in South Indian in the 10th century AD. 
• New irrigation systems for agriculture were developed- chain tanks in Andhra in 
the 9th century; and 6.4 km Kaveripak bund. 
• Cholas maintained links with China, Myanmar, and Campodia. 
• The tank supervision committee (Eri-variyam) looked after the maintenance of a 
village and regulated the water supply. 
1000-700 years ago  
• Arab conquest of Sind was during 711-712 AD; Md bin Qaism defeated Dahir, 
the Hindu king of Sind. Arabs were experts in gardening. 
• 1290- 1320AD (Reign of Khiljis): Alauddin Khilji destroyed the agricultural 
prosperity of a major part of India. He believed in keeping the farmers poor. 
Era of civilization 
It is supposed that man was evolved on earth about 1.7 million years ago. This man 
was evolved from the monkey who started to move by standing erect on his feet. Such 
man has been called Homo erectus (or) Java man (or) Peking man. Later on Java man 
transformed into Cro-Magnon and Cro-Magnon into modern man. The modern man is

zoologically known as Homo sapiens (Homo - Continuous, Sapiens - learning habit). A 
primitive form of Homo sapiens, called Neanderthal man (Homo sapiens 
neanderthalensis), was common in Europe and Asia.  After the last glacial period (about 
10,000 years ago), modern Homo sapien sapiens, began to spread all over the globe. 
In the beginning such man had been spending his life wildly, but during the period 
8700-7700 BC, they started to pet sheep and goat, although the first pet animal was dog, 
which was used for hunting. The history of agriculture and civilization go hand in hand as 
the food production made it possible for primitive man to settle down in selected areas 
leading to formation of society and initiation of civilization. The development of 
civilization and agriculture had passed through several stages. Archeologist initially 
classified the stages as stone age, Bronze and Iron age. Subsequently the scholars spilt up 
the stone age into Paleolithic period (old stone age), Neolithic age (New stone age) and 
Mesolithic age (Middle stone age).  
Each of three ages, saw distinct improvements. The man fashioned and improved 
tools out of stones, bones, woods etc. to help them in day-to-day life. They started 
growing food crops and domesticated animals like cow, sheep, goat, dog etc.  
I.  The Stone Age culture : (2,50,000 Bc to 3500 BC) 
 
The stone age is divided into three periods 
A. Palaeolithic period  (old stone age) 
B. Mesolithic period (middle stone age) 
C. Neolithic period (new stone age) 
A.  Paleolithic age : Hunters and food gatherers (2,50,000 to 10,000 BC) 
This period is characterized by the food gatherers and hunters. The stone age man 
started making stone tools and crude choppers.  The chipped stone tools and chopped 
pebbles were used for hinting, cutting and other purposes. He had no knowledge on 
cultivation and house building. 
 
The Palaeolithic age in India is divided into three phases according to the nature 
of stone tools used by the people and according the nature of climate 
a) Early or lower palaeolithic (2,50,000 to 1,00,000 BC) 
b) Middle palaeolithic (1,00,000 to 40,000 BC) 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology

Page 20 of 200.

c) Upper palaeolithic (40,000 to 10,000 BC) 
B.  Mesolithic period : Hunters and Herders (10,000 to 3,700 BC) 
The transitional period between the end of the Paleolithic and beginning of the 
Neolithic is called Mesolithic. It began about 10000BC and ended with the rise of 
agriculture. This period is characterized by tiny stone implements called microliths. The 
Mesolithic people lived on hunting, fishing and good-gathering.  At later stages, they also 
domesticated animals. The domestication of the dog was the major achievement of the 
Mesolithic hunter.  
C.  Neolithic Age : Food producers  (The beginning of Agriculture)  
The Neolithic age began between 9000 to 7500 BC.  Neolithic revolution occurred 
in Western Asia between 9500 and 8500 years ago mainly in the Fertilie Cresent (hilly 
regions embracing Israel, Jordon, Turkey, Iran, Caspian basin and adjoining Iranian 
plateau).  Neolithic revolution brought a major change in the techniques of food 
production which gave man control over his environment and saved him from the 
precarious existence of mere hunting and gathering of wild berries and roots. For the first 
time, he lived in settled villages and apart from security from hunger he had leisure time 
to think and contemplate.  
The main features of Neolithic culture in India  
1. Neolithic culture denotes a stage in economic and technological   development in  
    India  
2. Use of polished stone axes for cleaning the bushes  
3. Hand made pottery for storing food grains  
4. Invented textile, weaving and basketry  
5. Cultivation of rice, banana sequence and yams in eastern parts   of India  
6. Cultivation of millets and pulses in south India  
7. Discovery of silk  
II.  Bronze Age (Chalcolithic culture) (3000-1700 BC): 
The end of the Neolithic period saw the use of metal.  The metal to be used first 
was copper.  The term Chalcolithic (stone – copper phase) is applied to communities 
using stone implements along with copper and bronze. In more advanced communities,

the proportion of copper and bronze implements is higher than that of stones. The 
chalcolithic revolution began in Mesopotamia in the fourth millennium B.C. from this 
area it spread to Egypt, and Indus valley.  
The significant features are  
1. Invention of plough  
2. Agriculture shifted from hilly area to lower river valley  
3. Flood water were stored for irrigation and canals were dug  
4. Irrigated farming started in this period  
5. Sowing of seed by dibbling with a pointed stick  
6.  Use of wheel.  
7. Salinity problem and water logging were noticed due to canal irrigation. 
 
 
III.  The Iron Age 
 
The Iron phase in India started after the advent of Aryans.  Aryan land was called 
Saptasindhava i.e. the land of seven rivers (Sutlej, Beas, Ravi, Chenab, Jhelum, Sindhu 
and Saraswati).  Aryans settle along the rivers.   
 
The salient features of iron age are 
• The harvesting tool used was sickle.  
• The crops grown were mainly sesame and sugarcane. 
• Iron plough, shear, axe, sickles and hoes were used 
• The domestic animals were sheep, goats, dogs, mule, tortoise, cattle breeds and 
elephants.

Chronology of Agricultural technology development in India 
 
 
Agriculture in India is broadly classified in to five different periods before India’s 
independence. 
 
1. Early history (Before 15000 BCE) 
2. Vedic period – Post Maha Janapadas period (1500 BCE – 200 CE)  
3. Early Common Era – High Middle Ages (200–1200 CE)  
4. Late Middle Ages – Early Modern Era (1200–1757 CE)  
5. Colonial British Era (1757–1947 CE)  
[Note: BCE - short for "Before the Common Era", "Before the Christian Era", or "Before the 
Current Era". CE - Common Era, Current Era (Christian Era is, however, also abbreviated AD, 
for Anno Domini] 
 
Indian agriculture began by 9000 BCE as a result of early cultivation of plants and 
domestication of crops and animals. Settled life soon followed with implements and techniques 
being developed for agriculture. Double monsoons led to two harvests being reaped in one 
year. Indian products soon reached the world via existing trading networks and foreign crops 
were introduced to India. Plants and animals; considered essential to their survival by the 
Indians, came to be worshiped and venerated.  
 
The middle ages saw irrigation channels reach a new level of sophistication in India 
and Indian crops affecting the economies of other regions of the world under Islamic 
patronage. Land and water management systems were developed with an aim of providing 
uniform growth. Despite some stagnation during the later modern era the independent Republic 
of India was able to develop a comprehensive agricultural program.  
 
1. Early history (Before 1500 BCE) 
• 9000 BCE: Wheat and barley were domesticated in the Indian subcontinent. 
Domestication of horse, sheep and goat soon followed. This period also saw the first 
domestication of the elephant.  
• 8000-6000 BCE: Barley and wheat cultivation, along with the domestication of cattle, 
primarily sheep and goat—was visible in Mehrgarh (Balochistan, now in Pakistan). 
Agro pastoralism in India included threshing, planting crops in rows—either of two or 
of six—and storing grain in granaries. 
• 5000 BCE: Agricultural communities became widespread in Kashmir.  
• 5000-4000 BCE: Cotton was cultivated. The Indus cotton industry was well developed 
and some methods used in cotton spinning and fabrication continued to be practiced till 
the modern Industrialization of India. A variety of tropical fruit such as mango and 
muskmelon are native to the Indian sub-continent. The Indians also domesticated hemp, 
which they used for a number of applications including making narcotics, fibre and oil. 
The farmers of the Indus Valley grew peas, sesame, and dates. Sugarcane was 
originally from tropical South Asia and Southeast Asia. Different species likely 
originated in different locations with S. barberi originating in India and S. edule and S. 
officinarum coming from New Guinea. 
•  5440 BCE: Wild Oryza rice appeared in the Belan and Ganges valley regions of 
northern India. Rice was cultivated in the Indus Valley civilization.  
• 4500 BCE: Irrigation was developed in the Indus Valley Civilization. The size and 
prosperity of the Indus civilization grew as a result of this innovation, which eventually 
led to more planned settlements making use of drainage.

• 3000 BCE: Sophisticated irrigation and water storage systems were developed by the 
Indus Valley civilization, including artificial reservoirs at Girnar. 
• 2600 BCE:  An early canal irrigation system from Circa. 
• 2500 BCE:  Archeological evidence of an animal-drawn plough in the Indus Valley 
civilization 
• 2000 BCE: Agricultural activity included rice cultivation in the Kashmir and 
Harrappan regions.  
2. Vedic period-Post Maha Janapadas period (1500 BCE–200 CE) 
• Gupta (2004) finds it likely that summer monsoons may have been longer and may 
have contained moisture in excess than required for normal food production. One effect 
of this excessive moisture would have been to aid the winter monsoon rainfall required 
for winter crops.  
• In India, both wheat and barley are held to be Rabi (winter) crops and—like other parts 
of the world—would have largely depended on winter monsoons before the irrigation 
became widespread. The growth of the Kharif crops would have probably suffered as a 
result of excessive moisture.  
• Jute was first cultivated in India, where it was used to make ropes and cordage.  
• Some animals—thought by the Indians as being vital to their survival—came to be 
worshiped.  
• Trees were also domesticated, worshiped, and venerated—Pipal and Banyan in 
particular.  
• Others came to be known for their medicinal uses and found mention in the holistic 
medical system Ayurveda.  
• 1000–500 BCE: There are repeated references to iron. Cultivation of a wide range of 
cereals, vegetables and fruits is described. Meat and milk products were part of the diet; 
animal husbandry was important. The soil was ploughed several times. Seeds were 
broadcasted. Fallowing and a certain sequence of cropping were recommended. Cow 
dung provided the manure. Irrigation was practiced.  
• 322–185 BCE: The Mauryan Empire categorized soils and made meteorological 
observations for agricultural use. Other Mauryan facilitation included construction and 
maintenance of dams, and provision of horse-drawn chariots—quicker than traditional 
bullock carts.  
• 300 BCE: The Greek diplomat Megasthenes, in his book Indika— provides a secular 
eyewitness account of Indian agriculture.  
3. Early Common Era – High middle ages (200–1200 CE) 
• The Tamil people cultivated a wide range of crops such as rice, sugarcane, millets, 
black pepper, various grains, coconuts, beans, cotton, plantain, tamarind and 
sandalwood. Jackfruit, coconut, palm, areca and plantain trees were also known.  
• Systematic ploughing, manuring, weeding, irrigation and crop protection was practiced 
for sustained agriculture. Water storage systems were designed during this period. 
•  Kallanai (1st-2nd century CE), a dam built on river Kaveri during this period, is 
considered the as one of the oldest water-regulation structures in the world still in use. 
• Spice trade involving spices native to India—including cinnamon and black pepper—
gained momentum as India starts shipping spices to the Mediterranean. 
• Roman trade with India followed as detailed by the archaeological record and the 
Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. 
• Chinese sericulture attracted Indian sailors during the early centuries of the Common 
Era.

Sutlej Valley from Rampur ca. 1857 
• 320-550 CE: Crystallized sugar was discovered by the time of the Guptas and the 
earliest reference of candied sugar come from India.  
• 647 CE: Chinese documents confirm at least two missions to India, initiated in, for 
obtaining technology for sugar-refining.  
• 875-1279 CE : Noboru Karashima's research of the agrarian society in South India 
during the Chola Empire reveals that during the Chola rule land was transferred and 
collective holding of land by a group of people slowly gave way to individual plots of 
land, each with their own irrigation system. 
• The growth of individual disposition of farming property may have led to a decrease in 
areas of dry cultivation. 
•  The Cholas also had bureaucrats which oversaw the distribution of water—-
particularly the distribution of water by tank-and-channel networks to the drier areas.  
4. Late middle ages – Early modern era (1200–1757 CE) 
• The construction of water works and aspects of water technology in India is described 
in Arabic and Persian works. The diffusion of Indian and Persian irrigation 
technologies gave rise to irrigation systems which bought about economic growth and 
growth of material culture. 
• Agricultural 'zones' were broadly divided into those producing rice, wheat or millets. 
•  Rice production continued to dominate Gujarat and wheat dominated north and central 
India. 
• The Encyclopædia Britannica details the many crops introduced to India during this 
period of extensive global discourse.  
• 1556-1605 CE: Land management was particularly strong during the regime of Akbar 
the Great under whom scholar-bureaucrat Todarmal formulated and implemented 
elaborated methods for agricultural management on a rational basis. 
•  Indian crops—such as cotton, sugar, and citric fruits—spread visibly throughout North 
Africa, Islamic Spain, and the Middle East. 
• Though they may have been in cultivation prior to the solidification of Islam in India, 
their production was further improved as a result of this recent wave, which led to far-
reaching economic outcomes for the regions involved.[9] 
5. Colonial British Era (1757–1947 CE) 
 
• A 
number 
of 
irrigation 
canals 
are located on the 
Sutlej river. 
• Few 
Indian 
commercial 
crops—such 
as 
Cotton, 
indigo, 
opium, and rice—
made it to the 
global 
market 
under the British 
Raj in India. 
•  The second half 
of the 19th century saw some increase in land under cultivation and agricultural 
production expanded at an average rate of about 1% per year by the later 19th century.

•  Due to extensive irrigation by canal networks Punjab, Narmada valley, and Andhra 
Pradesh became centers of agrarian reforms.  
•  The British regime in India did supply the irrigation works but rarely on the scale 
required. 
• Community effort and private investment soared as market for irrigation developed. 
• Agricultural prices of some commodities rose to about three times between 1870-1920. 
• A rich source of the state of Indian agriculture in the early British era is a report 
prepared by a British engineer, Thomas Barnard, and his Indian guide, Raja 
Chengalvaraya Mudaliar, around 1774. This report contains data of agricultural 
production in about 800 villages in the area around Chennai in the years 1762 to 1766. 
This report is available in Tamil in the form of palm leaf manuscripts at Thanjavur 
Tamil University, and in English in the Tamil Nadu State Archives.  
• 1871: Government of India created Department of Revenue, Agriculture and 
Commerce which formed as base for Initiation of Agriculture in India.

Kautilya’s Arthasasthra - Sangam literature - rainfall prediction – ITK -Tamil Almanac.  
 
Agriculture in Arthasasthra 
Kautilya (also known as Vishnu Gupta or Chanakya) (321-296 BC) was a great scholar of 
time. He wrote a treatise titled, Arthasasthra, which deals with the management of resources. 
During Kautilya’s time agriculture, cattle breeding and trade were grouped into a science 
called ‘Varta’. Kautilya gave great importance to agriculture and suggested a separate post of 
head of agriculture and named as ‘Sitadhakashya’. Agriculture today receives prime 
importance, by policy and administrative support from government officials. eg. i) Supply of 
good seeds and other inputs, ii) Provision of irrigation water, iii) prediction of rainfall by IMD, 
iv) Assistance in purchase of machineries, v) Marketing and safe storage. All the important 
aspects are mentioned by Kautilya in his book. He suggested many important aspects in 
agriculture which are highly relevant today.  
1. The superintendent of agriculture should be a person who is knowledgeable in agriculture 
and horticulture. There was a   provision to appoint a person who was not an expert but he 
was assisted by other knowledgeable person.  
2. Anticipation of labours by land owners before sowing. Slaves and   prisoners were 
organised to sow the seeds in time. He also   emphasized that ploughing provides good soil 
texture   required for a particular crop.  
3. Timely sowing is very important for high yield particularly for   rainfed sowing for which, 
all the implements and accessories have to be kept ready. Any delay in these arrangements 
received   punitive action.  
4. Kautilya suggested that for getting good yield of rainfed crop, a   rainfall of 16 dronas 
(One drona = 40 mm to 50 mm; so totally 600-800 mm) was essential and 40 dronas 
rainfall (1600-200 mm) is sufficient for rice. It is very   significant to note that rain gauge 
was used during Kautilya’s period. It was apparently a circular vessel (20 fingers width, 8 
fingers depth) and the unit to measure rain was   adhaka (1 adhaka=12 mm approx.)  
5. He also stressed the optimum distribution of rainfall during crop   growing season. One 
third of the required quantity of rainfall must fall both in the commencement (July/August) 
and closing months (October-December) of rainy season; and 2/3 of rainfall in the middle 
(August-October) is considered as  very even.  
6. The crops should be sown according to the the season.   E.g. Sali (transplant rice), Virlu 
(direct sown rice), Till (Sesame) and millets should be sown at the commencement of rain. 
Pulses to be sown in the middle of season. Safflower, linseed, mustard, barley and wheat to 
be sown later.  
7. He also stressed that rice crop require less labour expense, vegetables are intermediate and 
sugarcane is worst as it requires more attention and expenditure.  
8. The crops like cucurbits are well suited to banks of rivers, Long-peper, sugarcane and 
grapes do well where the soil profile is   well charged with water. Vegetable require 
frequent irrigation, borders of field suited for cultivation of medicinal plants.  
9. Some of the bio-control practices suggested by Kautilya has got relevance. They are:  
a) Practice of exposing seeds to mist and heat for seven nights.  These practices are followed 
even now in wheat to prevent smut diseases.  
b) Cut ends of sugarcane are plastered with the mixture of honey, ghee and cow-dung. 
Recently evidences proved that honey has widely an antimicrobial property. Ghee could 
seal off the cut ends prevent loss of moisture and cow-dung facilitated bio-control of 
potential pathogens.

10. He also suggested that harvesting should be done at proper time and nothing should be left 
in the field not even chaff. The harvested   produce should be properly processed and 
safely stored. The above ground crop residues were also removed from fields and   fed to 
cattle.  
 
Agriculture in the Sangam literature  
During the Sangam period (200 BC to 100 AD), the main profession of the population of the 
Tamil region (now Tamil Nadu) was agriculture. The region extended from Cape Comorin 
(Kanniyakumari) in the South to Tirupati (in Andhra Pradesh) in the North, parts of present Kerala 
and Karnataka in the West. The methods of cultivation practised during this ancient period were 
revealed by several proverbs, village songs and literature of the period which are available even 
today. It is rather surprising that the people had good knowledge about agriculture (seed varieties, 
seed selection, seed storage, ploughing, manuring, irrigation, weeding, crop protection, pests, and 
botanical pesticides).  
The Sangam period literature covers wide aspects of the people’s life, such as epics, ethics, 
social life and religion. Several poems composed during this period have been passed on from 
generation to generation through memorizing and chanting and later through manuscripts written 
on Palmyara leaves. With the advent of paper and printing machinary, Shri Swaminatha Iyer who 
is popularly called ‘Tamill grandfather’ painstakingly collected them and brought them out as 
printed books. Two peoms of the Sangam period, viz., Tholkappiyam and Thirukural, gives us a 
vivid picture of agricultural practices in that period.  
Tholkappiyam  
The poem Tholkapiyam was written by the poet Tholkappier during 200 BC. It gives 
descriptions of various agricultural aspects and these are enumerated below.  
Land classification  
Land was classified into five (but, cultivable land in to four) groups, viz., Mullai (forest), 
Kurinji (hills), Marudham (cultivable lands), and Neithal (coastal areas). Palai land was not 
brought under cultivation and left as fallow. 
Seasons  
Six seasons are mentioned: Early spring, late spring, cloudy, rainy, early winter, and late 
winter.  
Cultivated crops  
There are references to rice, millets, sugarcane, banana, cardamom, pepper, cotton, sesame, 
coconut and nut. Farmers were aware that rice could be grown as rainfed crops. Banana and 
sugarcane were ratooned. Plants were considered as living beings and endowed with sensitivity. 
Tholkappier also mentioned about monocots and dicots.  
Importance of agriculture  
Kings considered agricultural development as their primary duty. They felt that soil fertility 
and irrigation facilities should be the country’s assets. Increased agricultural production was 
considered a yardstick of prosperity of the country. The stability of a kingdom was ensured not by 
army but by agriculture and sufficient crop production. Failure of monsoon rains and reduction in 
grain yield were attributed to the king’s sins.  
Irrigation  
Kings dug-out tanks at locations where water flow from rains was plentiful. Semicircular 
bunds were raised adjacent to small hillocks and water reservoirs akin to present day dams were 
raised and constructed. It indicates awareness of water harvesting. The king ‘Karikal Cholan’ 
brought 1000 slaves from a conquered country and raised the bunds of river Cauvery. The stone

dam constructed across the river Cauvery centuries ago is considered a master piece of 
engineering even today. River water was diverted to tanks through canals. It is mentioned that 
irrigation should be given both in early morning or late evening, and not during hot mid-day.  
Agricultural implements  
Buffaloes were used for ploughing with a wooden plough. Deep ploughing was considered 
superior to shallow ploughing. A labour saving tool called Parambu was used for leveling paddy 
fields. Tools such as Amiry, Keilar, and Yettam were used to lift water from wells, tanks, and 
rivers. Tools called Thattai and Kavan were used for scaring birds in millet fields. Traps were 
used to catch wild boars in millet fields.  
Seeds  
Seed was selected from those earheads that first matured. The selected seed was stored for 
sowing only and never used as food grain. It was believed that such a diversion would destroy the 
family.  
Crop rotation  
Crop rotation was practised by raising black gram (urd) after rice. This indicates that farmers 
were aware of the benefits to the following rice crop which we now know is due to the nitrogen 
fixation in the root nodules of urd. They also practised mixed cropping; e.g., foxtail millet with 
lablab or cotton.  
Threshing  
A tool called Senyam was used for harvesting rice. Threshing of rice was done by hand with 
the help of a buffalo (and in large holdings by elephants). Hand winnowing was done to remove 
chaff. One sixth of the produce was paid as tax to the king. Farm labourers were paid in kind.  
The land was immediately ploughed after harvest or water was allowed to the field to 
facilitate rooting of stubbles. Operations requiring hard work such as ploughing were done by men 
while women attended to light work such as transplanting, weeding, bird scaring, harvesting and 
winnowing. In Kandapuranam, it is mentioned that Valli, daughter of a king, was sent for bird 
scaring in millet fields where Lord Muruga (son of Lord Shiva) courted her and married.  
Marketing  
Products were exchanged by weight. In Madurai (the headquarters of Sangam poets), there 
was a food grain bazaar where 18 kinds of cereals, millets and pulses were sold. Each shop had a 
banner hoisted high so that it could be seen from a distance indicating that the grains are sold here. 
Customs duty was collected on imports and exports.  
Thirukural  
The poem was composed by a gifted poet named Thiruvalluvar during 70 BC. It consists of 
1330 couplets (133 topics each having 10 couplets). It is the pride of Sangam Tamil literature and 
its greatness can be realized from the fact that it has been translated into English and several other 
languages. It devotes one topic (10 couplets) for agriculture under the chapter politics. This clearly 
reveals the recognition that the prime duty of a king is to ensure agricultural production.  
 Importance of agriculture  
‘World spins around many industries. All such industries spin around agriculture’  
‘Farmers alone live an independent life; others worship them and are second to them’  
‘If farmers stop cultivation, even rishis (sages) cannot survive’  
Ploughing  
‘If land is ploughed deep and soil allowed drying to one fourth weight, even manuring is not 
necessary’  
Manuring  
‘Manuring is more important than ploughing: crop protection is more important than

irrigation’. Green leaf manuring, farmyard manure, and sheep penning were in vogue though 
farmers were not aware that they supplied nitrogen to the crop. One is amazed at the depth of 
agricultural knowledge our ancestors possessed.  
Irrigation  
Bed method was followed as an efficient method of water management.  
Weeding  
‘Just like the farmer pulls out weeds with the root system, so the king should eliminate 
criminals from society’.  
Care of crops  
‘If the farmer does not regularly visit his field, the crop will not grow’  
The foregoing account of agriculture from ancient Tamil literature clearly indicates the 
agricultural knowledge of our forefathers. By following their footsteps, the present generation of 
agricultural scientists has used the advanced technologies and has tried to stabilize agricultural 
production in our country to meet our food requirements.  
                                             
Rainfall prediction 
• 
Large number of fireflies seen at night on the forest trees is a sign that the monsoon will 
start early (Farmers in Maharashtra). 
• 
If there is rain, accompanied with lightning and mild thunder on the second day of Jayastha 
month (May – June), there will be no rain for the next 72 days (Farmers Gujarat)  
 
Indigenous Technical Knowledge (ITK) 
ITK is defined as the sum total of knowledge and practices which are based on people's 
accumulated experience in dealing with situations and problems in various aspects of life and such 
knowledge and practices are special to a particular culture. 
When the farmers continuously practicing indigenous knowledge, it will be also relevant to 
enquire why they do so. In other words, what are the advantages of such practices as perceived by 
farmers? Understanding the rational of such practices from farmers’ point of view, may also help 
researchers to look into the valid factors while they research to farmers need and help extension 
workers to select appropriate technologies based on few criteria  
• Summer ploughing conserves moisture, eradicates weeds, consolidates soil erosion and 
minimizes the number of ploughings at the time of sowing.   
• Due to cowdung coating for cotton seeds, the easy dibbling of seeds to remove fuzz, good 
germination, no cost and pest-reduction were the advantages. 
• Soaking sorghum seeds in cow urine before sowing increase the drought tolerance and the 
seeds had germination with minimum rain and it was considered as no cost practice. 
• Soaking Bengal gram in water as found with the previous practice, farmers had resorted to 
the practice of soaking bengal gram in water before sowing because it considered as no 
cost and withstanding water stress. 
• Cotton seeds treated with red soils facilitate easy dibbling of seeds and it favours good 
germination. 
• Cattle penning practices improve the soil fertility owing to organic manure. 
• Sorghum mixed with lab-lab given additional yield owing to mixed cropping and it 
enhances nitrogen fixation by leguminous lab-lab. 
• Use of cow dung cake as burrow fumigant is economical in controlling rats.

• Raising castor as a border crop in cotton field is used as trap crop for the cotton pest and it 
also provided additional income. 
• Easy removal of pest, easy separation of kernels, longer shelf life and higher economics are 
advantages of coating red gram with red soil.  
• Mixing green gram with ash was one of the post harvest indigenous practice and it had 
certain advantages like pest reduction and cheaper method. 
 
Tamil Almanac (Panchangam)  
An annual publication including weather forecasts and other miscellaneous information 
arranged according to the calendar of a given year  
 
The Tamil Almanac is used in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry in India, and by the Tamil 
population in Malaysia, Singapore and Sri Lanka. It is used today for cultural, religious and 
agricultural events, with the Gregorian calendar having largely supplanted it for official use both 
within and outside India. It is based on the classical Hindu solar calendar also used in Assam, 
Bengal, Kerala, Manipur, Nepal, Orissa and the Punjab. 
 
There are several festivals based on the Tamil Hindu calendar. The Tamil New Year 
follows the Nirayanam vernal equinox and generally falls on April 13 or 14th of the Gregorian 
year. April 13 or 14th marks the first day of the traditional Tamil calendar and this remains a public 
holiday in both Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka. Tropical vernal equinox fall around 22 March, and 
adding 23 degrees of trepidation or oscillation to it, we get the Hindu sidereal or Nirayana Mesha 
Sankranti (Sun's transition into nirayana Aries).  
 
 
Hence, the Tamil calendar begins on the same date in April which is observed by most 
traditional calendars of the rest of India.  
Week 
 
The days of the Tamil calendar relate to the celestial bodies in the solar system: Sun, 
Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn, in that order. The week starts with Sunday.

Agronomy – definition – meaning and scope. Agro-climatic zones of India and Tamil Nadu – 
Agro ecological zones of India  
 
Agronomy is derived from a Greek word ‘agros’ meaning ‘field’ and ‘nomos’ meaning 
‘management’. Principles of agronomy deal with scientific facts in relations to environment in 
which crop are produced.  
Definition of Agronomy 
1. It is defined as an agricultural science deals with principles and practices of crop 
production and field management.  
2. Agronomy is branch of agricultural science, which deals with principles, & practices of 
soil, water & crop management. 
3. It is branch of agricultural science that deals with methods which provide favorable 
environment to the crop for higher productively, 
Boundaries and scale 
 
Crop management, and its scientific study agronomy, are part of a system that comprises 
the physical elements of the climate, soil and land, the biological constituents of the vegetation 
and soil, the economic opportunities and constraints of markets, sales and profit, and the social 
circumstances and preferences of those who work the land.

Scope of Agronomy 
 
Agronomy is a dynamic discipline with the advancement of knowledge and better 
understanding of planet, environment and agriculture. Agronomy science becomes imperative in 
Agriculture in the following areas. 
• Identification of proper season for cultivation of wide range of crops is needed which could 
be made possible only by Agronomy science. 
• Proper methods of cultivation are needed to reduce the cost of cultivation and maximize 
the yield and economic returns. 
• Availability and application of chemical fertilizers has necessitated the generation of 
knowledge to reduce the ill-effects due to excess application and yield losses due to the 
unscientific manner of application. 
• Availability of herbicides for control of weeds has led to development for a vast 
knowledge about selectivity, time & method of its application. 
• Water management practices play grater role in present day crisis of water demand and 
Agronomy science answer to the questions ‘how much to apply?’ and ‘when to apply?’. 
• Intensive cropping is the need of the day and proper time and space intensification not only 
increase the production but also reduces the environmental hazards. 
• New technology to overcome the effect of moisture stress under dry land condition is 
explored by Agronomy and future agriculture is depends on dry land agriculture. 
• Packages of practices to explore full potential of new varieties of crops are the most 
important aspects in crop production which could be made possible only by Agronomy 
science. 
• Keeping farm implements in good shape and utilizing efficient manner to nullify the 
present day labour crisis is further broadening the scope of agronomy. 
• Maintaining the ecological balance through efficient management of crops, livestock and 
their feedings in a rational manner is possible only by knowing agronomic principles. 
• Care and disposal of farm and animal products like milk and eggs and proper maintenance 
of accounts of all transactions concerning farm business is governing principles of 
agronomy.  
 
Relation of agronomy to other sciences 
Agronomy is a main branch of Agriculture. It is synthesis of several disciplines like soil 
science, Agricultural chemistry, crop physiology, plant ecology, biochemistry and economics.  
 The Soil Science helps the agronomist to thoroughly understand the soil physical, chemical 
and biological properties to effect modification of the soil environment. 
 The Agricultural Chemistry help the agronomist to understand the chemical composition 
and changes involved in the production, protection, and use of crops and livestock. 
 The crop physiology helps to understand the basic life process of crops to understand 
functioning of each parts of plant to determine their input requirement like nutrients etc. 
 The plant ecology helps us to understand the associated environment in which the crops 
grown like the influence of weather (Temperature, Rainfall etc). 
 The biochemistry shows the way in which biochemical process takes place in crops which 
helps to understand critical requirements to favourably activate this process. 
 The economics paves the way for profit and loss analysis in farming.

Role of Agronomist 
Agronomist is a scientist who is dealing with the study of problems of crop production and 
adopting/recommending practices of better field crop production and soil management to get high 
yield and income. 
• Agronomist aims at obtaining maximum production at minimum cost by exploiting the 
knowledge of the basic and applied sciences for higher crop production. 
• In a broader sense, agronomist is concerned with production of food and fibre to meet the 
needs of growing population.  
• He develops efficient and economic field preparation method for sowing crops in different 
season. (Flat bed, Ridges and furrows) 
• He is also involved to selection of suitable crop and varieties to suit or to match varied 
seasons and soils. Eg. Red soil - groundnut, Black soil - cotton, Sandy soil – tuberous 
crops, Saline soil – Finger millet (Ragi). In Kharif if water is sufficient go for rice and 
water is not sufficient go for maize, sorghum.  
• Evolves efficient method of cultivation (whether broadcasting, nursery and transplantation 
or dibbling, etc.) provides better crop establishment and maintain required population  
• He has to identify various types of nutrients required by crops including time and method 
of application (e.g. for long duration rice (150-60-60 kg NPK), short duration: 120:50:50 
kg NPK/ha Application P&K basal and N in three splits)  
• Agronomist must select a better weed management practice.  Either through mechanical or 
physical (by human work) or chemical (herbicides or weedicides, e.g. 2-4-D) or cultural 
(by having wide space it may increase weed growth by using inter space crops).  Weeds 
are controlled by integrated weed management method also 
• Selection of proper irrigation method, irrigation scheduling i.e. irrigation timing and 
quantity based on the crops to be irrigated, whether to irrigate continuously or stop in 
between and how much water to be supplied are computed by agronomy science so as to 
achieve maximum water use efficiency.  
• Crop planning (i.e.) suitable crop sequence are developed by agronomist (i.e.) what type of 
crop, cropping pattern, cropping sequence, etc. (Rice - Rice - Pulse) 
• Agronomists are also develops the method of harvesting, time for harvesting, etc.  
(Appropriate time of harvest essential to prevent yield loss)  
• Agronomist is responsible for every decision made in the farm management.  (What type 
of crop to be produced? How much area to be allotted for each crop? How and when to 
market?  How and When to take other management activities?) All the decisions should be 
taken at appropriate time to efficiently use resources available) 
 
Agro-climatic zones  
 
An agro-climatic zone is a land unit uniform in respect of climate and length of growing 
period (LGP) which is climatically suitable for a certain range of crops and cultivars (FAO, 1983).  
Classification by Planning Commission  
 
Planning Commission of India (1989) made an attempt to delineate the country into 
different agro climatic regions based on homogeneity in rainfall, temperature, topography, 
cropping and farming systems and water resources. India is divided into 15 agro-climatic regions.  
1. Western Himalayan zone 
 
This zone consists of three distinct sub-zones of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh 
and Uttar Pradesh hills. The region consists of skeletal soils of cold region, podsolic mountain

meadow soils and hilly brown soils. Lands of the region have steep slopes in undulating terrain. 
Soils are generally silty loams and these are prone to erosion hazards. 
2. Eastern Himalayan zone 
 
Sikkim and Darjeeling hills, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Tripura, 
Mizoram, Assam and Jalpaiguri and Coochibihar districts of West Bengal fall under this region, 
with high rainfall and high forest cover. Shifting cultivation is practiced in nearly one-third of the 
cultivated area and this has caused denudation and degradation of soils with the resultant heavy 
runoff, massive soil erosion and floods in lower reaches and basins. 
3. Lower Gangetic Plains zone 
 
This zone consists of West Bengal-lower Gangetic plain region. The soils are mostly 
alluvial and are prone to floods. 
4. Middle Gangetic Plains zone 
This zone consists of 12 districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh and 27 districts of Bihar plains. 
This zone has a geographical area of 16 million hectares and rainfall is high. About 39% of gross 
cropped area is irrigated and the cropping intensity is 142%. 
5. Upper Gangetic Plains zone 
 
This zone consists of 32 districts of Uttar Pradesh. Irrigation is through canals and tube 
wells. A good potential for exploitation of ground water exists. 
6. Trans-Gangetic Plains zone 
 
This zone consists of Punjab, Haryana, Union territories of Delhi and Chandigarh and 
Sriganganagar district of Rajasthan. The major characteristics of this area are: highest net sown 
area, highest irrigated area, high cropping intensity and high groundwater utilization. 
7. Eastern Plateau and Hills zone 
 
This zone consists of eastern part of Madhya Pradesh, southern part of West Bengal and 
most of inland Orissa. The soils are shallow and medium in depth and the topography is 
undulating with a slope of 1-10%. Irrigation is through tanks and tube wells. 
8. Central Plateau and Hills zone 
 
This zone comprises of 46 district of Madhya Pradesh, part of Uttar Pradesh and 
Rajasthan. The topography is highly variable nearly 1/3rd of the land is not available for 
cultivation. Irrigation and cropping intensity are low. 75% of the area is rainfed grown with low 
value cereal crops. There is an intensive need for alternate high value crops including horticultural 
crops. 
9. Western Plateau and Hills zone 
 
This zone comprises the major part of Maharastra, parts of Madhya Pradesh and one 
district of Rajasthan. The average rainfall of the zone is 904 mm. The net sown area is 65% and 
forests occupy 11%. The irrigated area is only 12.4% with canals being the main source. 
10. Southern Plateau and Hills zone 
 
This zone comprises 35 districts of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu which are 
typically semi-arid zones. Dryland farming is adopted in 81% of the area and the cropping 
intensity is 111 percent. 
11. East Coast Plains and Hills zone 
 
This zone comprises of east coast of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. Soils are 
mainly alluvial and coastal sands. Irrigation is through canals and tanks. 
12. West Coast Plains and Ghats zone 
 
This zone comprises west coast of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharastra and Goa 
with a variety of crop patterns, rainfall and soil types. 
13. Gujarat Plains and Hills zone 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 37 of 200.

 
This zone consists of 19 districts of Gujarat. This zone is arid with low rainfall in most 
parts and only 32.5% of the area is irrigated largely through wells and tube wells. 
14. Western Dry zone 
 
This zone comprises nine districts of Rajasthan and is characterized by hot sandy desert, 
erratic rainfall, high evaporation, scanty vegetation. The ground water is deep and often brackish. 
Famine and drought are common features of the region. 
15. Islands zone 
 
This zone covers the island territories of Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadeep which are 
typically equatorial with rainfall of 3000 mm spread over eight to nine months. It is largely a 
forest zone with undulated lands.

7. Hilly zone 
1. North Eastern zone 
 
This zone covers the districts of Thiruvallur, Vellore, Kanchipuram, Thiruvannamalai, 
Viluppuram, Cuddalore (excluding Chidambaram and Kattumannarkoil taluks), some parts of 
Perambalur including Ariyalur taluks and also Chennai. The mean annual rainfall of this region is 
1054 mm received in 53 rainy days and is benefited by both the monsoons. The mean monthly 
maximum temperature ranges between 28.2 to 38.9 °C and the minimum ranges from 19.5 to 
24.8°C.  
2. North Western zone 
 
This zone comprises of Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri district (excluding hilly areas), Salem, 
Namakkal district (excluding Tiruchengode taluk) and Perambalur taluk of Perambulur district. 
The climate prevailing in this region is dry and sub humid. This region has been identified as 
moderately drought prone area. The elevation varies from 330 to 1070 m above mean sea level. 
The mean annual rainfall of this region is appreciably lower than in North Eastern zone and is 825 
mm received in 47 rainy days. The region is benefited by both south-west and north-east monsoon 
rains but unlike the NEZ, the former contributed more to the total rainfall. The mean monthly 
maximum temperature ranges between 30 to 37°C with minimum temperature ranging between 19 
to 25.5°C. The annual PET of this region is 1727 mm compared to the annual precipitation of 825 
mm.

673.8mm during North East Monsoon. 
5. Southern zone 
 
This is the biggest among the seven zones of Tamil Nadu. It is typical zone surrounded by 
coastal areas on the East and mountains in the West. This zone comprises Sivagangai, 
Ramanathapuram, Virudunagar, Tuticorin and Tirunelveli districts and Natham and Dindigul 
taluks of Dindigul district, Melur, Tirumangalam, Madurai South and Madurai North taluks of 
Madurai district and Pudukkottai district excluding Aranthangi taluk. This zone lies on the 
Southern part of the State under rain shadow area. Because of this, the area is prone to drought 
very often. The climate is semi-arid tropics. The elevation varies from mean sea level to 300 m. 
The mean annual rainfall is 776 mm received in 43 rainy days. The monthly mean maximum 
temperature in this region ranges from 28.5°C in December to 38.5°C in June. The monthly mean 
minimum temperature varies from 21.0°C in January to 27.5°C in June. 
6. High rainfall zone 
 
This zone consists of Kanayakumari district. This district situated in the southern most part 
of the Peninsular India, with its high rainfall having a climate which is entirely different from the 
rest of the state. The climate is monsoon tropics and there is seasonal in shores flow of moist air. 
The elevation ranges from sea level to about 600 m. The mean annual rainfall of the district is 
1469 mm received in 64 rainy days. There is not much fluctuation in the mean monthly air 
temperature. The monthly mean maximum temperature varies from 28.0°C in December to 33.5°C 
in May. The monthly mean minimum temperature varies from 22°C in December to 26.5°C in 
May. 
7. High altitude and Hilly zone 
 
This zone comprises the hilly regions, namely the Nilgiris, Shevroys, Elagiri-Javvadhu, 
Kollimalai, Patchaimalai, Anamalais, Palanis and Podhigaimalais. The rainfall varies from 850 
mm in Kalrayan hills to about 4500 mm in Anamalai hills.  
 
Agro-ecological zones of India 
An ecological region is characterized by distinct ecological responses to macroclimate as 
expressed in vegetation and reflected in soils, fauna and aquatic systems. Therefore, an agro-
ecological region is the land unit on the earth’s surface carved out of agro-climatic region when 
superimposed on different landform and soil conditions that act as modifiers of climate and length 
of growing period (LGP). 
National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning (NBSS & LUP) of the ICAR has 
delineated 20 agro-ecological regions (AERs) in the country using the FAO 1978 concept of 
superimposition of length of growing periods and bio-climate maps on soil physiographic map.

lateritic soils. LGP 150-180 (210) days. 
13. Eastern plain, hot sub-humid (moist) eco-region, alluvial soils. LGP 180-210 days. 
14. Western Himalayas, warm sub-humid to humid eco-region with brown forest soils. LGP 
180-210+ days.  
Humid-Perhumid ecosystem 
15. Bengal and Assam plain hot sub-humid (moist) to humid eco-region, alluvial soils. LGP 
210+ days. 
16. Eastern Himalayas, warm per-humid eco-region, brown and red hill soils. LGP 210 + days. 
17. North eastern hills, warm per-humid eco-region, red and lateritic soils. LGP 210+ days.  
Coastal Ecosystem  
18. Eastern coastal plain, hot sub-humid to semiarid eco-region, coastal alluvium. LGP 90-210 
+days. 
19. Western Ghats and coastal plain, hot humid-per-humid eco-region, red, lateritic and 
alluvium derived soils. LGP 210+ days. 
Island Ecosystem  
20. Andaman Nicobar and Lakshadeep, hot humid to per-humid eco-region, real loamy and 
sandy soils. LGP 210+ days. 
The major advantage of LGP based criteria is that the LGP is the direct indicative of moisture 
availability of a given landform rather than the total rainfall. For example, both Ratnagiri in 
western Maharashtra and Nagpur in eastern Maharashtra have LGP 180-210 +  days but the total 
annual rainfall of Ratnagiri is more than 2000 mm where as that of Nagpur is only 1100 mm. 
Therefore, agro-ecosystems approach allows crop planning based on length of growing period 
rather than the  quantity of rainfall.

Crops and major soils - Classification – Economic and agricultural importance in India and 
Tamil Nadu 
CROPS 
In general, crop is an organism grown and / or harvested for obtaining yield. Agronomically, 
crop is a plant cultivated for economic purpose. 
Classification of crops 
Classification is done to generalize similar crop plants as a class for better understanding of 
them.  
Classification types used in crops 
1. Based on ontogeny (Life cycle) 
2. Based on economic use (Agronomic) 
3. Based on Botany (Scientific) 
4. Based on seasons 
5. Based on climate 
1. Based on Ontogeny (Life cycle) 
a) Annual crops:  
 
Crop plants that complete life cycle within a season or year. They produce seed and die 
within the season. Ex. Wheat, rice, maize, mustard etc.  
b) Biennial crops:  
 
Plants that have life span of two consecutive seasons or years. First years/ season, these 
plants have purely vegetative growth usually confined to rosette of leaves. The tap root is often 
fleshy and serves as a food storage organ. During the second year / season, they produce flower 
stocks from the crown and after producing seeds the plants die. Ex. Sugar beet, beet root, etc.  
c) Perennial crops:   
 
They live for three or more years. They may be seed bearing or non-seed bearing. Ex. 
Napier fodder grass, coconut, etc. 
2. Based economic use (Agronomic)  
a) Cereals: Cereal derived from word ‘Ceres’ which denotes as ‘Goddess’ who was believed as the 
giver of grains by Romans. Cereals are the cultivated grasses grown for their edible starchy grains. 
Larger grains used as staple food – Rice, wheat, maize, barley, oats etc.  
Cereal grain contains 60 to 70% of starch and is excellent energy rich foods for humans. In 
almost every country and region, cereals provide the staple food. In the world as a whole, only 5% 
of starchy staple food comes from root crops (mainly cassava, potato, and yams, depending on 
climate), whereas the rest is from cereal. Cereals are an excellent source of fat soluble vitamin E, 
which is an essential antioxidant. Whole cereal grains contain 20 to 30% of the daily requirements 
of the minerals such as selenium, calcium, zinc and copper. 
b) Millets:  
Millets are small grained cereals, staple food in drier regions of the developing countries are 
called ‘millets’. They are also annual grasses of the group cereals.  But’ they are grown in lesser 
area or less important area whose productivity and economics are also less important. These are also 
staple food for people of poor countries. In India, pearl millet is a staple food in Rajasthan. 
Millets are broadly classified in to two, 1)  Major millets and 2)  Minor millets. 
Major millets 
1. Sorghum /Jowar/Cholam  
-  Sorghum bicolor 
2. Pearl millet /Bajra/Cumbu 
-  Pennisetum glaucum 
3. Finger millet or Ragi 
 
-  Eleusine coracona 
Minor millets 
1. Foxtail millet / Thenai 
 
-  Setaria italica 
2. Little millet / Samai 
 
-  Panicum miliare

c) Pulses:  
Seeds of leguminous plants used as food (Dhal) rich in protein. Pod containing grain is the 
economic portion. Pulses are preferred for protein rich value & also economic important in cropping 
system. The wastes or stalk is called the ‘haulm’ or ‘stover’. Haulm is used as green manure and has 
high value cattle feed. Green pods used as vegetables, e.g. cowpea, lablab. Seed coat of pulses are 
nutritious cattle feed.

Groundnut: 
Pod is economic portion in groundnut and contains 50% of oil content. Oil is edible or 
cooking oil and haulm is a used as cattle feed and also has manure value. The shell has fuel value; it 
is used for soil amendment.  It is a bed material in the poultry forms. Oil cake is used as cattle feed 
and has manural value.  Oil is used for production of Vanaspathi and soap making. 
Sesame: 
Sesame oil is cooking oil and economic parts are generally seeds (in the pod). Gingelly cake 
is used as a cattle feed, whereas capsule and stalk are used for composting / burning purpose. 
Castor: 
Seed (kernal) of castor contains oil and used as medicinal and industrial oil. Mainly aviation 
industries use this for lubrication purpose. Castor cake is concentrated organic manure. The shell 
and stalk is used for fuel purpose. 
Mustard: 
Mustard oil is edible oil and seeds are the economic portion. Oil cake is a good cattle feed. 
Safflower and sunflower:

Oil is used for cooking purpose. Both of these oils contain more of unsaturated fatty acids 
and used for heart patients. Cake is used as cattle feed and also organic material and decorticated 
manure. 
Niger: 
Seed is the economic portion and used in soap making, paint, varnish & light lubricant. Crop is 
generally an industrial crop. 
Linseed: 
Oil extracted from seeds is used in preparation of paints and varnishes. 
e. Sugar crops 
Crops cultivated for sugar. Juice is extracted from stem of sugarcane used for jaggery or 
sugar. Number of by products like molasses, bagasse, pressmud etc. is obtained from sugar industry. 
Molasses used for alcohol and yeast formation and bagasse for paper making and fuel. Pressmud 
used for soil amendment; whereas, trash (green leaf + dry foliage) is used for cattle feed.  
Sugar beet is another sugar crop where tubers are mainly used for extraction of sugar. 
Tubers and tops are used as a fodder for cattle feed. 
 
1. Sugarcane -  Saccharum officinarum 
 
2. Sugar beet -  Beta vulgaris 
f) Fibre crops:  
Plants are grown for obtaining fibre. Different kinds of fibre are, i) seed fibre – cotton;              
ii) Stem/ bast fibre – Jute, mesta; iii) leaf fibre – Agave, pineapple. 
Cotton:  
Important fibre crop of the world, used for garment purpose.  Seed for cattle feed and oil is 
edible purpose. Epidermal hairs of seed coats is the economic portion. Lint (Kapas-seed) has 
industrial value (fibre) and stalk is of fuel nature. 
Jute, Sunnhemp, mesta: 
The fibre obtained from stems is used for gunny bags, ropes. Stem itself is used as fuel. 
Sunnhemp is used for both stem fibre and green manure crop. 
g) Fodder / Forage: It refers to vegetative matter, fresh or preserved, utilized as feed for animals. It 
includes hay, silage, pasturage and fodder. 
Ex. 1. Grasses - Bajra napier grass, guinea grass, fodder sorghum, fodder maize. 
       2. Legumes - Lucerne, Desmanthus, etc.                                                                                                             
h) Spices and condiments: Crop plants or their products used for flavour, taste and add colour to 
the fresh or preserved food. Ex.– Ginger, garlic, fenugreek, cumin, turmeric, chillies, onion, 
coriander, anise and asafetida. 
i) Medicinal plants: Crops used for preparation of medicines. Ex. Tobacco, mint. etc. 
j) Beverages: Products of crops used for preparation of mild, agreeable and simulating drinking. Ex.  
Tea, coffee, cocoa (Plantation crops). 
3. Scientific or botanical classification

4. Based on seasons 
Crops are grouped under the seasons in which their major field duration falls.  
a) Kharif crops: Crops grown during June-July to September–October which require a warm wet 
weather during their major period of growth and shorter day length for flowering. 
  
Ex. Rice, maize, castor, groundnut. 
b) Rabi crops: Crops grown during October–November to January-February, which require cold 
dry weather for their major growth period and longer day length for flowering.  
 
Ex. Wheat, mustard, barley, oats, potato, bengal gram, berseem, cabbage and cauliflower. 
c) Summer crops: Crops grown during February–March to May–June which require warm dry 
weather for growth and longer day length for flowering. Ex.Black gram, greengram, seasome, 
cowpea etc.  
This classification is not a universal one. It only indicates the period when a particular crop 
is raised. Ex. Kharif rice, kharif maize, rabi maize, summer pulse etc.  
5. Based on climatic condition 
1) Tropical crop 
: Coconut, sugarcane 
2) Sub-tropical crop : Rice, cotton 
3) Temperate crop 
: Wheat, barley 
4) Polar crop  
: All pines, pasture grasses 
SOILS 
Soil is defined as the thin layer of earth’s crust made up of disintegrated and decomposed 
rocks, complex mineral compound, organic matter, water/air and living organism like bacteria, 
fungi, insects and worms and serves as the natural medium of growth of plants. 
It provides nutrients, moisture, anchorage (support) and provides air to root system. There 
are different soil groups found in varied regions of India.  Each group differs from other in physical 
and chemical properties. The variation in behaviour is mainly due to the nature of the parent 
material from which the soils are formed. Parent materials are Igneous rocks, sedimentary rocks and 
metamorphic rocks. Physical properties like structure, texture, colour, water holding capacity, depth 
etc. are to be noted.  Chemical properties like the presence of various plant elements, pH, EC, CEC, 
acidic or alkaline, etc. are considered.

Major soils of India 
1. Alluvial soil (Entisols, Inceptisols and Alfisol) 
2. Black soil (Vertisol) 
3. Red soil (Alfisol) 
4. Laterite soil (Ultisol)  
5. Desert soil (Aridisol) 
6. Forest soil and hill soil, peat and marshy soils  
7. Problem soils (saline, alkali, acid) 
1. Alluvial soil or Indo-Gangetic Alluvium  
This is the most extensive soil found in India. Out of total area  of India, 48.0 m.ha comes 
under river alluvium. These soils include deltaic alluvium, calcareous alluvium and coastal

5
alluvium. Alluvial soils are formed by transportation in streams and rivers and are deposited in 
flood plains or along the coastal belts. Newly formed alluvium may not have distinct soil horizons 
while older alluvium may have soil horizons. They occur in the basins of Indus, Ganges, 
Brahmaputra, Godavari, Krishna, Cauvery and Tambiraparani deltas spread in U.P., Bihar, West 
Bengal, Gujarat, Punjab, Rajasthan, Andhra Predesh, Tamil Nadu.  
Newer alluvium is called as Khadar, is sandy, light colour and less Kankar nodules. Older 
alluvium is called as Bhangar, full of clay, dark colour and more Kankar nodules. Alluvial soils of 
high altitude are acidic in nature and plains are neutral to alkaline. Alluvial soils of plains are 
medium in phosphorous content and high in potassium content. Generally, alluvial soils are rich in 
nutrients and are fertile and they support good crop growth with plenty of water. Many crops 
including vegetable are cultivated in river alluvium. Crops like rice, wheat, cotton, maize, 
sugarcane, vegetables, jute, oil seeds, millets, pulses and fruits are cultivated in these soil. 
2. Black soil 
Dark-grey in colour due to clay-humus complex. Area around 32.0 m.ha is under this soil. 
This soil is also called black cotton soil, mixing of soil along the entire column with 
Montmorillonite clay. Cotton grows very well with water available in soil. Black soil holds more 
moisture and available for a long time.  Found in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, South Orissa, 
South and Coastal Andhra Pradesh, North Karnataka and parts of Tamil Nadu. Black soil contains 
high proportion of clay (30-40%), so, the water holding capacity is high. Typical characteristics of 
this black soil are swelling (during wet period) and shrinkage (dry period).  While dry, it forms very 
deep cracks of more than 30-45 cm.  In Kovilpatti (Tamil Nadu) areas the cracks may extend to 2 to 
3 m with a width of 1 to 6 cm. Field preparation takes longer time compared to other soil. Only after 
secondary tillage, the soil is suited for crop production. The soils are fine grained contain high 
proportion of Calcium and Magnesium carbonates. They are poor in N, medium in P and medium to 
high in K (Characteristic feature of typical Indian soil).  
In Tamil Nadu Black soils have high pH (8.5 to 9) and are rich in lime (5-7%), have low 
permeability. The soils are with more cation exchange capacity (40-60 m.e./100 g). Crops grown in 
this soil are cotton, bengal gram, mustard, millets, pulses, oil seeds (sunflower, safflower) are 
commonly grown in this soil. Most of the soils come under rainfed areas. 
3. Red soil  
 
Based on the colour (due to presence of ferric oxides) it is called as red soil. Around 30 m.ha 
are found in India. They are formed from granites and other metamorphic rocks. Mostly found in 
semi-arid areas and the colour varies from red to yellow. The soil is light textured, with Kaolinite 
type of clay. Well drained with moderate permeability. Low cation exchange capacity and low 
water holding capacity. Red soil is present in Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, 
North and East of Arunachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Parts of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. They are 
shallow in depth because they are degraded or drained soil. Lesser clay and more sandy than 
Vertisol. Red soil is always in acidic nature. Highly suitable for groundnut crop cultivation. Crops 
like millets, pulses, oil seeds (ground nut, gingelly, castor) and tuber crops like cassava are 
commonly cultivated. 
4. Laterites and Lateritic soil 
Laterite soils are formed due to the process of laterisation.  i.e., leaching of all cations 
leaving Fe and Al oxides. Mostly found in hills and foothill areas.  This soil is formed under high 
intensive down pour of rainfall. It is modified form of red soil, clay content is minimum. Rich in 
organic matter content and rich in fertility and medium water holding capacity. They become very 
hard when there is no water. The cohesive nature is high. Acid loving crops (Plantation crops) and 
fruits (pineapple, avacado) are more cultivated. Tea, rubber, pepper, spices are cultivated. At lower 
elevation places, rice is grown. 
5. Desert soil 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 47 of 200.

 
6
Found in desert regions of Rajasthan (Thar desert), parts of Haryana and Punjab of India. 
More sand is found  and sand dunes are common. Clay content is < 8%  only. Poor fertility, poor 
water holding capacity and susceptible to soil erosion. Presence of sodic salts (high Na content) 
leads to alkalinity. Crops like date palm, cucumber, millets  are cultivated (countries like Saudi 
Arabia,  UAE, Jordan, Sudan etc). 
6. Peaty and Organic soil 
 
These soils are very rich in organic matter. Found in Kerala, coastal regions of West Bengal, 
Orissa, South and East coast of Tamil Nadu. Deposition of organic matter by the elevated soil. 
Peaty and organic soil is not suitable for majority of crops.  Rice is mostly cultivated in coastal area 
in rainy season. 
7. Problem soil  
Saline soils: Contain excess amounts of neutral soluble salts dominated by chlorides and sulphates 
of Na, Ca and Mg affects plant growth. White encrustation of salts and hence called white alkali. 
These soils are characterized by, EC: 4dSm-1 at 25°C, ESP: < 15; pH; < 8.5. This soil needs 
leaching and drainage before cropping for amelioration.   
i) High salt tolerant: Sesbania, Rice, sugarcane, oats, berseem, lucerne, indian clover & barley. 
ii) Medium salt tolerant: Castor, cotton, sorghum, pearl millet, maize, mustard & wheat. 
iii) Low salt tolerant: Pulses, peas, Sunnhemp, gram, linseed and sesame. 
Sodic / Alkali soils: High content of carbonates and bicarbonates of Na. Hence, they are with high 
exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) with dark encrustation, hence called as black alkali. These 
soils are rich in NaHCO3 and characterized by pH: > 8.5; EC : < 4dSm-1; ESP : > 15. Use gypsum 
(CaSO4, 2H2O) as amendment for reclamation of sodic alkali soils. Iron pyrites (FeS2), bulky 
organic manures (especially green manure) and crop residues which produces weak organic acids.  
i) Tolerant crops: Karnal / rhodes / para/ bermuda grass, rice and sugar beet. 
ii) Semi–tolerant: Wheat, barley, oats, berseem and sugarcane. 
iii) Sensitive: Cowpea, gram, groundnut, lentil, peas and maize. 
Acid soils: These are low pH with high amounts of exchangeable H+ and Al3. Occur in regions with 
high rainfall. Significant amount of partly decomposed organic matter exist. Have low CEC and 
high base saturation. Liming and judicious use of fertilizers are the management measures 
suggested. Suitable crops: Acedophytes (like potato).

Factors affecting crop production – climatic – edaphic - biotic- physiographic and socio 
economic factors 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I. Internal factors 
Genetic factors  
 
The increase in crop yields and other desirable characters are related to Genetic make 
up of plants. 
• High yielding ability 
• Early maturity 
• Resistance to lodging  
• Drought flood and salinity tolerance  
• Tolerance to insect pests and diseases 
• Chemical composition of grains (oil content, protein content ) 
• Quality of grains (fineness, coarseness) 
• Quality of straw (sweetness, juiciness) 
The above characters are less influenced by environmental factors since they are governed 
by genetic make-up of crop. 
2. External factors  
A. Climatic 
B. Edaphic 
C. Biotic 
D. Phsiographic 
E. Socio-economic 
A. CLIMATIC FACTORS 
 
Nearly 50 % of yield is attributed to the influence of climatic factors.The following are 
the atmospheric weather variables which influences the crop production.  
1. Precipitation  
2. Temperature 
3. Atmospheric humidity 
4. Solar radiation 
5. Wind velocity 
6. Atmospheric gases 
1. Precipitation 
• Precipitation includes all water which falls from atmosphere such as rainfall, snow, 
hail, fog and dew. 
• Rainfall one of the most important factor influences the vegetation of a place. 
• Total precipitation in amount and distribution greatly affects the choice of a cultivated 
species in a place.

• In heavy and evenly distributed rainfall areas, crops like rice in plains and tea, coffee 
and rubber in Western Ghats are grown. 
• Low and uneven distribution of rainfall is common in dryland farming where drought 
resistance crops like pearl millet, sorghum and minor millets are grown. 
• In desert areas grasses and shrubs are common where hot desert climate exists 
• Though the rainfall has major influence on yield of crops, yields are not always directly 
proportional to the amount of Precipitation as excess above optimum reduces the yields 
• Distribution of rainfall is more important than total rainfall to have longer growing 
period especially in drylands 
2. Temperature  
• Temperature is a measure of intensity of heat energy. The range of temperature for 
maximum growth of most of the agricultural plants is between 15 and 40ºC. 
• The temperature of a place is largely determined by its distance from the equator 
(latitude) and altitude.  
• It influences distribution of crop plants and vegetation. 
• Germination, growth and development of crops are highly influenced by temperature. 
• Affects leaf production, expansion and flowering. 
• Physical and chemical processes within the plants are governed by air temperature. 
• Diffusion rates of gases and liquids changes with temperature. 
• Solubility of different substances in plant is dependent on temperature. 
• The minimum, maximum (above which crop growth ceases) and optimum temperature 
of individual’s plant is called as cardinal temperature. 
3. Atmospheric Humidity (Relative Humidity - RH) 
• Water is present in the atmosphere in the form of invisible water vapour, normally 
known as humidity. Relative humidity is ratio between the amount of moisture present 
in the air to the saturation capacity of the air at a particular temperature.   
• If relative humidity is 100% it means that the entire space is filled with water and  there 
is no soil evaporation and plant transpiration. 
• Relative humidity influences the water requirement of crops 
• Relative humidity of 40-60% is suitable for most of the crop plants.   
• Very few crops can perform well when relative humidity is 80% and above.  
• When relative humidity is high there is chance for the outbreak of pest and disease. 
 
4. Solar radiation (without which life will not exist) 
• From germination to harvest and even post harvest crops are affected by solar radiation. 
• Biomass production by photosynthetic processes requires light. 
• All physical process taking place in the soil, plant and environment are dependent on 
light  
• Solar radiation controls distribution of temperature and there by distribution of crops in 
a region.  
• Visible radiation is very important in photosynthetic mechanism of plants. 
Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR - 0.4 – 0.7µ) is essential for production of 
carbohydrates and ultimately biomass.

0.5 to 0.6 µ - Green –yellow – low active  
• Photoperiodism is a response of plant to day length 
Short day – Day length is <12 hours (Rice, Sunflower and cotton), long day – Day 
length is > 12 hours (Barley, oat, carrot and cabbage), day neutral – There is no or less 
influence on day length (Tomato and maize). 
• Phototropism –– Response of plants to light direction. Eg. Sunflower 
• Photosensitive – Season bound varieties depends on quantity of light received 
 
5. Wind velocity 
• The basic function of wind is to carry moisture (precipitation) and heat.   
• The moving wind not only supplies moisture and heat, also supplies fresh CO2 for the 
photosynthesis.  
• Wind movement for 4 – 6 km/hour is suitable for more crops.   
• When wind speed is enormous then there is mechanical damage of the crops (i.e.) it 
removes leaves and twigs and damages crops like banana, sugarcane 
• Wind dispersal of pollen and seeds is natural and necessary for certain crops. 
• Causes soil erosion. 
• Helps in cleaning produce to farmers. 
• Increases evaporation. 
• Spread of pest and diseases.  
6. Atmospheric gases on plant growth  
• CO2 – 0.03%,  O2 - 20.95%, N2 - 78.09%, Argon - 0.93%, Others - 0.02%. 
• CO2 is important for Photosynthesis, CO2 taken by the plants by diffusion process 
from leaves through stomata 
• CO2 is returned to atmosphere during decomposition of organic materials, all farm 
wastes and by respiration 
• O2 is important for respiration of both plants and animals while it is released by plants 
during Photosynthesis  
• Nitrogen is one of the important major plant nutrient, Atmospheric  N is fixed in the 
soil by lightning, rainfall and N fixing microbes in pulses crops and available to plants 
• Certain gases like SO2, CO, CH4, HF released to atmosphere are toxic to plants 
 
B. EDAPHIC FACTORS (soil) 
Plants grown in land completely depend on soil on which they grow. The soil factors that 
affect crop growth are 
1. Soil moisture 
2. Soil air  
3. Soil temperature 
4. Soil mineral matter 
5. Soil organic matter 
6. Soil organisms 
7. Soil reactions 
1. Soil moisture 
• Water is a principal constituent of growing plant which it extracts from soil 
• Water is essential for photosynthesis 
• The moisture range between field capacity and permanent wilting point is available to 
plants. 
• Available moisture will be more in clay soil than sandy soil 
• Soil water helps in chemical and biological activities of soil including mineralization 
• It influences the soil environment Eg. it moderates the soil temperature from extremes 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology

4 
• Nutrient availability and mobility increases with increase in soil moisture content. 
2. Soil air 
• Aeration of soil is absolutely essential for the absorption of water by roots 
• Germination is inhibited in the absence of oxygen 
• O2 is required for respiration of roots and micro organisms. 
• Soil air is essential for nutrient availability of the soil by breaking down insoluble 
mineral to soluble salts 
• For proper decomposition of organic matter 
• Potato, tobacco, cotton linseed, tea and legumes need higher O2 in soil air 
• Rice requires low level of O2 and can tolerate water logged (absence of O2) condition. 
3. Soil temperature 
• It affects the physical and chemical processes going on in the soil. 
• It influences the rate of absorption of water and solutes (nutrients) 
• It affects the germination of seeds and growth rate of underground portions of the crops 
like tapioca, sweet potato. 
• Soil temperature controls the microbial activity and processes involved in the nutrient 
availability 
• Cold soils are not conducive for rapid growth of most of agricultural crops 
4. Soil mineral matter 
• The mineral content of soil is derived from the weathering of rocks and minerals as 
particles of different sizes.  
• These are the sources of plant nutrients  
 
 
eg; Ca, Mg, S, Mn, Fe, K etc 
5. Soil Organic matter 
• It supplies all the major, minor and micro nutrients to crops 
• It improves the texture of the soil 
• It increases the water holding capacity of the soil, 
• It is a source of food for most microorganisms 
• Organic acids released during decomposition of organic matter enables mineralisation 
process thus releasing unavailable plant nutrients 
6. Soil organisms: 
• The raw organic matter in the soil is decomposed by different micro organisms which 
in turn releases the plant nutrients 
• Atmospheric nitrogen is fixed by microbes in the soil and is available to crop plants 
through symbiotic (Rhizobium) or non-symbiotic (Azospirillum) association 
7. Soil reaction (pH) 
• Soil reaction is the pH (hydrogen ion concentration) of the soil. 
• Soil pH affects crop growth and neutral soils with pH 7.0 are best for growth of most of 
the crops  
• Soils may be acidic (<7.0), neutral (=7.0), saline and alkaline (>7.0) 
• Soils with low pH is injurious to plants due high toxicity of Fe and Al.  
• Low pH also interferes with availability of other plant nutrients. 
 
C. BIOTIC FACTORS 
Beneficial and harmful effects caused by other biological organism (plants and animals) on the 
crop plants 
1. Plants 
• Competitive and complimentary nature among field crops when grown together 
• Competition between plants occurs when there is demand for nutrients, moisture and 
sunlight particularly when they are in short supply or when plants are closely spaced  
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 52 of 200.

 
 
5 
• When different crops of cereals and legumes are grown together, mutual benefit results 
in higher yield (synergistic effect) 
• Competition between weed and crop plants as parasites eg: Striga parasite weed on 
sugarcane crop 
2. Animals 
• Soil fauna like protozoa, nematode, snails, and insects help in organic matter 
decomposition, while using organic matter for their living 
• Insects and nematodes cause damage to crop yield and considered as harmful 
organisms. 
• Honey bees and wasps help in cross pollination and increases yield and considered as 
beneficial organisms  
• Burrowing earthworm facilitates aeration and drainage of the soil as ingestion of 
organic and mineral matter by earthworm results in constant mixing of these materials 
in the soils. 
• Large animals cause damage to crop plants by grazing (cattle, goats etc) 
D. Physiographic factors: 
• Topography is the nature of surface earth (leveled or sloppy) is known as topography. 
Topographic factors affect the crop growth indirectly. 
• Altitude – increase in altitude cause a decrease in temperature and increase in 
precipitation and wind velocity (hills and plains) 
• Steepness of slope: it results in run off of rain water and loss of nutrient rich top soil 
• Exposure to light and wind: a mountain slope exposed to low intensity of light and 
strong dry winds may results in poor crop yields (coastal areas and interior pockets) 
E. Socio-economic factors 
• Society inclination to farming and members available for cultivation 
• Appropriate choice of crops by human beings to satisfy the food and fodder 
requirement of farm household. 
• Breeding varieties by human invention for increased yield or pest & disease resistance 
• The economic condition of the farmers greatly decides the input/ resource mobilizing 
ability (marginal, small, medium and large farmers)

Tillage – Definition – objectives – types of tillage - modern concepts of tillage – main field 
preparation 
Tillage 
Tillage operations in various forms have been practiced from the very inception of growing 
plants. Primitive man used tools to disturb the soils for placing the seeds. The word tillage is 
derived from ‘Anglo-Saxon’ words Tilian and Teolian, meaning ‘to plough and prepare soil for seed 
to sow, to cultivate and to raise crops’. Jethrotull, who is considered as father of tillage suggested 
that thorough ploughing is necessary so as to make the soil into fine particles. 
Tillage is the mechanical manipulation of soil with tools and implements for obtaining conditions 
ideal for seed germination, seedling establishment and growth of crops. 
Tilth is the physical condition of soil obtained out of tillage (or) it is the result of tillage. The tilth 
may be a coarse tilth, fine tilth or moderate tilth. 
Objectives of tillage 
 
The main objectives of tillage are, 
• To prepare a good seed bed which helps the germination of seeds. 
• To create conditions in the soil suited for better growth of crops. 
• To control the weeds effectively. 
• To make the soil capable for absorbing more rain water. 
• To mix up the manure and fertilizers uniformly in the soil. 
• To aerate the soil. 
• To provide adequate seed-soil contact to permit water flow to seed and seedling roots. 
• To remove the hard pan and to increase the soil depth. 
 
To achieve these objectives, the soil is disturbed / opened up and turned over.  
Types of tillage: Tillage operations may be grouped into 
 
 
1. On season tillage  2. Off-season tillage 
1. On-season tillage 
Tillage operations that are done for raising crops in the same season or at the onset of the 
crop season are known as on-season tillage. They may be preparatory cultivation and after 
cultivation. 
A. Preparatory tillage: This refers to tillage operations that are done to prepare the field for raising 
crops.  It consists of deep opening and loosening of the soil to bring about a desirable tilth as well as 
to incorporate or uproot weeds and crop stubble when the soil is in a workable condition.  
Types of preparatory tillage 
a. 
Primary tillage  
b. 
Secondary tillage 
a. Primary tillage: The tillage operation that is done after the harvest of crop to bring the land under 
cultivation is known as primary tillage or ploughing.  Ploughing is the opening of compact soil with 
the help of different ploughs.  Country plough, mould board plough, bose plough, tractor and power 
tiller drawn implements are used for primary tillage. 
b. Secondary tillage: The tillage operations that are performed on the soil after primary tillage to 
bring a good soil tilth are known as secondary tillage. Secondary tillage consists of lighter or finer 
operation which is done to clean the soil, break the clods and incorporate the manure and fertilizers. 
Harrowing and planking is done to serve those purposes.  
Planking is done to crush the hard clods, level the soil surface and to compact the soil 
lightly.  Harrows, cultivators, Guntakas and spade are used for secondary tillage. 
c. Layout of seed bed: This is also one of the components of preparatory tillage. Leveling board, 
buck scrapers etc. are used for leveling and markers are used for layout of seedbed.

2 
B. After cultivation (Inter tillage):  The tillage operations that are carried out in the standing crop 
after the sowing or planting and prior to the harvesting of the crop plants are called after tillage.  
This is also called as inter cultivation or post seeding/ planting cultivation.  It includes harrowing, 
hoeing, weeding, earthing up, drilling or side dressing of fertilizers etc.  Spade, hoe, weeders etc. 
are used for inter cultivation. 
2. Off-season tillage: Tillage operations done for conditioning the soil suitably for the forthcoming 
main season crop are called off-season tillage.  Off season tillage may be, post harvest tillage, 
summer tillage, winter tillage and fallow tillage. 
Special purpose tillage: Tillage operations intended to serve special purposes are said to be special 
purpose tillage.  They are,  
a. Sub-soiling: To break the hard pan beneath the plough layer, special tillage operation (chiseling) 
is performed to reduce compaction. Sub-soiling is essential and once in four to five years where 
heavy machineries are used for field operations, seeding, harvesting and transporting. Advantages 
of sub-soiling are, greater volume of soil may be obtained for cultivation of crops, excess water may 
percolate downward to recharge the permanent water table, reduce runoff and soil erosion and roots 
of crop plants can penetrate deeper to extract moisture from the water table. 
b. Clean tillage:  It refers to working of the soil of the entire field in such a way no living plant is 
left undisturbed. It is practiced to control weeds, soil borne pathogen and pests. 
c. Blind tillage: It refers to tillage done after seeding or  planting the crop (in a sterile soil) either at 
the pre-emergence  stage of the crop plants or while they are in  the early stages of growth so that 
crop plants (sugarcane, potato etc.) do not get damaged, but, extra plants and broad leaved weeds 
are uprooted. 
d. Dry tillage: Dry tillage is practiced for crops that are sown or planted in dry land condition 
having sufficient moisture for germination of seeds. This is suitable for crops like broadcasted rice, 
jute, wheat, oilseed crops, pulses, potato and vegetable crops. Dry tillage is done in a soil having 
sufficient moisture (21-23%). The soil becomes more porous and soft due to dry tillage.  Besides, 
the water holding capacity of the soil and aeration are increased. These conditions are more 
favourable for soil micro-organisms. 
e. Wet tillage or puddling:  The tillage operation that is done in a land with standing water is 
called wet tillage or puddling. Puddling operation consists of ploughing repeatedly in standing 
water until the soil becomes soft and muddy. Puddling creates an impervious layer below the 
surface to reduce deep percolation losses of water and to provide soft seed bed for planting rice. 
Puddling is done in both the directions for the incorporation of green manures and weeds.  Wet 
tillage destroys the soil structure and the soil particles that are separated during puddling settle later. 
Wet tillage is the only means of land preparation for transplanting semi-aquatic crop plant such as 
rice. Planking after wet tillage makes the soil level and compact. Puddling hastens transplanting 
operation as well as establishment of seedlings. Wet land ploughs or worn out dry land ploughs are 
normally used for wet tillage. 
Depth of ploughing 
The desirable depth of ploughing is 12 to 20 cm for field crops. The ploughing depth varies 
with effective root zone of the crop. The depth of ploughing is 10-20 cm for shallow rooted crops 
and 15-30 cm for deep rooted crops. 
Number of ploughing 
Number of ploughing depends on soil conditions, time available for cultivation between two 
crops and type of cropping systems. Zero tillage is practiced in rice fallow pulses. Minimum 
number of ploughing is taken up at optimum moisture level to bring favourable tilth depending on 
need of the crop.

Time of ploughing  
The optimum soil moisture content for tillage is 60% of field capacity. 
Modern concepts in tillage: 
 
Conventional tillage involves primary tillage to break open and turn the soil followed by 
secondary tillage to obtain seed bed for sowing or planting.  With the introduction of herbicides in 
intensive farming systems, the concept of tillage has been changed. Continuous use of heavy 
ploughs create hard pan in the subsoil, results in poor infiltration. It is more susceptible to run-off 
and erosion.  It is capital intensive and increase soil degradation. To avoid these ill effects, modern 
concepts on tillage is in rule. 
1. Minimum tillage: It aims at reducing tillage operations to the minimum necessity for ensuring a 
good seed bed.  The advantages of minimum tillage over conventional tillage are, 
• The cost and time for field preparation is reduced by reducing the number of field 
operations. 
• Soil compaction is comparatively less. 
• Soil structure is not destroyed. 
• Water loss through runoff and erosion is minimum. 
• Water storage in the plough layer is increased. 
Tillage can be reduced in 2 ways 
1. By omitting operations which do not give much benefit when compared to the cost. 
2. By combining agricultural operations like seeding and fertilizer application. 
The minimum tillage systems can be grouped into the following categories, 
1. Row zone tillage  
 
Primary tillage is done with mould board plough in the entire area of the field; secondary 
tillage operations like discing and harrowing are reduced and done only in row zone. 
2. Plough plant tillage 
 
After the primary tillage, a special planter is used for sowing. In one run over the field, the 
row zone is pulverized and seeds are sown by the planter 
3. Wheel track tillage 
 
Primary ploughing is done as usual. Tractor is used for sowing; the wheels of the tractor 
pulverize the row zone in which planting is done. 
 
In all these systems, primary tillage is as usual.  However, secondary tillage is replaced by 
direct sowing in which sown seed is covered in the row zone with the equipment used for sowing. 
2. Zero tillage (No tillage): In this, new crop is planted in the residues of the previous crop without 
any prior soil tillage or seed bed preparation and it is possible when all the weeds are controlled by 
the use of herbicides. Zero tillage is applicable for soils with a coarse textured surface horizon, good 
internal drainage, high biological activity of soil fauna, favourable initial soil structure and an 
adequate quantity of crop residue as mulch.  These conditions are generally found in Alfisols, 
Oxisols and Ultisols in the humid and sub-humid tropics. 
Till planting  
 
Till planting is one method of practicing zero tillage. A wide sweep and trash bar clears a 
strip over the previous crop row and planter opens a narrow strip into which seeds are planted and 
covered. Here, herbicide functions are extended. Before sowing, the vegetation present has to be 
destroyed for which broad spectrum non selective herbicides like glyposate, paraquat and diquat are 
used. 
Advantages  
• Zero tilled soils are homogenous in structure with more number of earthworms. 
• Organic matter content increases due to less mineralization. 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 56 of 200.

 
4 
• Surface run-off is reduced due to presence of mulch. 
Disadvantages 
• Higher amount of nitrogen has to be applied for mineralization of organic matter in zero 
tillage. 
• Perennial weeds may be a problem. 
• High number of volunteer plants and buildup of pests.  
3. Stubble mulch tillage or stubble mulch farming  
 
Soil is protected at all times either by growing a crop or by leaving the crop residues on the 
surface during fallow periods. Sweeps or blades are generally used to cut the soil up to 12 to 15 cm 
depth in the first operation after harvest and depth of cut is reduced during subsequent operations. 
When large amount of residues are present, a disc type implement is used for the first operation to 
incorporate some of the residues into the soil. This hastens the decomposition but still keeps enough 
residues on top soil. 
Two methods for sowing crops in stubble mulch tillage are, 
1. Similar to zero tillage, a wide sweep and trash bars are used to clear a strip and a narrow 
planter shoe opens a narrow furrow into which seeds are placed. 
2. A narrow chisel of 5-10 cm width is worked through the soil at a depth of 15-30 cm leaving 
all plant residues on the surface. The chisel shatters the tillage pans and surface crusts. 
Planting is done with special planters. 
Disadvantages of stubble mulch farming  
• The residues left on the surface interfere with seed bed preparation and sowing operations. 
• The traditional tillage and sowing implements or equipments are not suitable under these 
conditions. 
4. Conservation tillage: The major objective is to conserve soil and soil moisture. It is a system of 
tillage in which organic residues are not inverted into the soil such that they remain on surface as 
protective cover against erosion and evaporation losses of soil moisture.  If stubble forms the 
protective cover on the surface, it is usually referred to as stubble mulch tillage. The residues left on 
soil surface interfere with seed bed preparation and sowing operations. It is a year round system of 
managing plant residue with implements that undercut residues, losses the soil and kills the weeds.   
Advantages 
• Energy conservation through reduced tillage operations. 
• Improve the soil physical properties. 
• Reduce the water runoff from fields. 
Main field preparation: 
Tillage operations are generally classified in to two, preparatory cultivation and after 
cultivation. The preparatory cultivation or tillage is operations that are done before the cultivation. 
This preparatory cultivation is generally called as main field preparation. The main field preparation 
involves three processes, viz., primary tillage, secondary tillage and lay-out for sowing. Some of the 
important primary tillage implements are country plough, mould board plough, disc plough, chisel 
plough etc. Cultivators and harrows are generally used for secondary tillage purpose. However, in 
practical means, the first two (primary and secondary tillages) may not have any key difference, 
since; both operations are mainly carried out with same implement. Country plough and cultivators 
are used for both the purposes. After thorough ploughing, the field modified in to suitable way for 
planting such as ridges and furrows or beds and channels or pit according to the need of the crops. 
Such field modifications are mandatory for better crop production.

geometry 
SEEDS 
Plant propagation is made in two ways, Sexual (by seeds) and asexual (by vegetative 
means). Biologically, seed is a ripe, fertilized ovule and a unit of reproduction of flowering plants.  
SEED RATE 
 
The required number of plants/unit area is decided by calculating the seed rate. The seed rate 
depends on spacing or plant population, test weight, germination percentage. The formula is as 
follows. 
 
                    Plant population (per ha) x No. of seeds/hill x Test weight (g) x 100 
Seed rate (kg/ha) = ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Broadcasting is otherwise called as random sowing.  Literally means ‘scattering the seeds’.  
Broadcasting is done for many crops. Broadcasting is mostly followed for small sized to medium 
sized crops. This is the largest method of sowing followed in India, since; it is the easiest and 
cheapest and requires minimum labours. To have optimum plant population in unit area certain 
rules should be followed. 
• Only a skilled person should broadcast the seeds for uniform scattering. 
• The ploughed field should be in a perfect condition to trigger germination. 
The seeds are broadcasted in a narrow strip and the sowing is completed strip by strip.  To 
ensure a good and uniform population, it is better to broadcast on either direction. This is called 
criss-cross sowing.  If the seed is too small, it is mixed with sand to make a bulky one and for easy 
handling. Ex. Seasame seeds are mixed with sand at 1:15 or 1:10 ratio and sown.  
In certain cases the person sowing will be beating the seeds against the basket for uniform 
scattering. Ex. Sorghum, pearl millet. 
After broadcasting, the seeds are covered gently either using a country plough with a very 
shallow ploughing or some wooden planks (boards / levelers) are used to cover the surface. In some 
cases, tree twigs or shrub branches are used.  If the seeds are large, levelers collect the seeds and 
leave in the other side. Comb harrow is the best used one. 
Disadvantages 
• All the seeds broadcasted do not have contact with the soil. 100% germination is not 
possible. 
• Enhanced seed rate is required. 
• Seeds cannot be placed in desired depth.  Desired depth ensures perfect anchorage.  Lodging 
(falling down) is common in broadcasting. 
2. Dibbling 
This is actually line sowing. Inserting a seed through a hole at a desired depth and covering 
the hole. Dibbling is practiced on plain surface and ridges and furrows or beds and channels. This 
type of sowing is practiced only under suitable soil condition.  Rice fallow cotton is dibbled on a

2
plain surface.  The seeds are dibbled at 2/3rd from top or 1/3rd at bottom of the ridge. Before sowing, 
furrows are opened and fertilizers are applied above which seeds are sown.  The seeds do not have 
contact with the fertilizers.  This is done for wider spaced crops and medium to large sized seeds. 
Ex. Sorghum, maize, sunflower, cotton are dibbled on ridges and furrows.  Both beds and channels; 
and ridges and furrows come under line sowing.  While earthing up, the plant occupies middle of 
the ridge.  Earthing up is essential for proper anchorage of the root system. 
Advantages of line sowing are, (i) uniform population, (ii) better germination, (iii) reduced 
seed rate.

Not possible 
5. 
Uniform utilization of resources (land, water, light, 
nutrient, etc.) 
Resource utilization is un-uniform 
3. Sowing behind the plough 
Sowing behind the plough is done by manual or mechanical means.  Seeds are dropped in 
the furrows opened by the plough and the same is closed or covered when the next furrow is 
opened.  The seeds are sown at uniform distance.  Manual method is a laborious and time 
consuming process.  Seeds like redgram, cowpea and groundnut are sown behind the country 
plough.  Major sown crop is ground out.  Seeds are sown by mechanical means by Gorus – seed 
drill.  A seed drill has a plough share and hopper.  Seeds are placed on hopper.  Different types of 
seed drill are available, e.g., simple Goru – Guntakas. 
Advantages: i) The seeds are placed at desired depth covered by iron planks, ii) except very small, 
very large seeds most of the seeds can be sown, e.g. maize, sorghum, millets, sunflower, etc. 
4. Drill sowing (or) Drilling 
 
Drilling is the practice of dropping seeds in a definite depth covered with soil and 
compacted. In this method, sowing implements are used for placing the seeds into the soil. Both 
animal drawn Gorus and power operated (seed drills) implements are available. Seeds are drilled 
continuously or at regular intervals in rows. In this method, depth of sowing can be maintained and 
fertilizer can also be applied simultaneously. It is possible to take up sowing of inter crops also. It 
requires more time, energy and cost, but maintains uniform population per unit area. Seeds are 
placed at uniform depth, covered and compacted. 
5. Transplanting 
This method of planting has two components, a. nursery and b. transplanting. In nursery, 
young seedlings are protected more effectively in a short period and in a smaller area.  Management 
is easy and economical. 
Advantages 
• Can ensure optimum plant population 
• Sowing of main field duration, i.e., management in the main field is reduced 
• Crop intensification is possible under transplanting 
Disadvantages 
• Nursery raising is expensive 
• Transplanting is another laborious and expensive method 
Age of seedlings is 1/4th of the total duration of the crop. If the total duration is 16 weeks, 
four week period (1 month) is under nursery beds. Nursery age is not very rigid, e.g., thumb rule – 3 
months crop – nursery duration 3 weeks, minimum 4 months – 4 weeks minimum period; 5 months

3
– 5 weeks. After the nursery period, seedlings are pulled out and transplanted. This is done on the 
main field after thorough field preparation or optimum tilth. The seedlings are dibbled in lines or in 
random. Closer spaced crops are mostly raised in random method even after nursery, Ex. rice and 
finger millet. For vegetables, desired spacing is required during transplanting.  Transplanting shock 
is a period after transplanting, the seedlings show no growth. This is mostly due to the change in the 
environment between root and the soil. The newly planted seedlings should adjust with new 
environment.  It is for a period of 5-7 days depending upon season, crop, variety, etc. At higher 
temperature, dehydration is possible and leaves dried out.  Area required for nursery normally is 
1/10th of the total area. 
GERMINATION 
• Germination is a protrusion of radicle or seedling emergence. 
•  Germination results in the rupture of the seed coat and emergence of seedling from 
embryonic axis. 
Factors affecting seed germination 
1. Soil: Soil type, texture, structure and microorganisms greatly influence the seed 
germination. 
2. Moisture: When the seeds do not get required moisture in the soil, the viability is lost.  
When the moisture is excess after germination, it will lead to rotting of the sprouts. 
3. Temperature: When it is above and below the optimum temperature, the germination rate 
will be affected. 
4. Light: The most effective wavelength for promoting germination is red (662 nm) and 730 
nm inhibits germination.  
5. Soil condition: a. Tilth is the most important soil factor influences on germination of seed. 
Small seeds require fine tilth whereas, moderate and larger seeds requires medium and 
coarse tilth soils, respectively.  
b. Depth of sowing: The seeds should be placed at optimum depth. When the seeds are 
placed at deeper layers they have to spend more energy for germination. When it is placed 
on soil surface, it will be taken away by birds/worked away. The thumb rule is to sow seeds 
to a depth of approximately 3 to 4 times diameter of the seed. The optimum depth of sowing 
for most of the field crops ranged between 3 and 5 cm depth. The seeds sown should be 
protected from rodents or birds before germination by employing labourers to scare the birds 
at least for three days after sowing. 
CROP STAND ESTABLISHMENT 
Good crop establishment is one of the most important features in better crop production. The 
better crop establishment is in turn expressed as optimum plant population in fields. Number of 
plants per unit area in the cropped field is called as plant population. 
Optimum plant population 
It is the number of plants required to produce maximum output or biomass per unit area.  
Any increase beyond this stage results in either no increase or reduction in biomass. 
Importance of plant population  
• Yield of any crop depends on final plant population.  
• The plant population depends on germination percentage and survival rate in the field.  
• Under rain fed conditions, high plant population will deplete the soil moisture before 
maturity, where as low plant population will leave the soil moisture unutilized. 
• When soil moisture and nutrients are not limited high plant population is necessary to utilize 
the other growth factors like solar radiation efficiently. 
• Under low plant population, individual plant yield will be more due to wide spacing. 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology

Page 60 of 200.

• Under high plant population, individual plant yield will be low due to narrow spacing 
leading to competition between plants. 
• Yield per plant decreases gradually as plant population per unit area is increased, but yield 
per unit area increases up to certain level of population. That level of plant population is 
called as optimum population. 
• So, to get maximum yield per unit area, optimum plant population is necessary. So the 
optimum plant population for each crop should be identified. 
Factors affecting plant population 
A. Genetic Factors 
1. Size of the plant 
• The volume occupied by the plant at the time of flowering decides the spacing of the crop. 
• Plants of red gram, cotton, sugarcane etc. occupy larger volume of space in the field 
compared to rice and wheat. 
• Even the varieties of the same crop differ in size of the plant.  
2. Elasticity of the plant 
• Variation in size of the plant between minimum size of the plant that can produce some 
economic yield to the maximum size of the plant that can reach under unlimited space and 
resources is the elasticity of the plant. 
• The optimum plant population range is high in indeterminate plants. Ex.  Redgram – 55,000 
to1,33,000 plants/ha. 
• The elasticity is due to tillering and branching habit of the plants. 
• For determinate plants like pearl millet, sorghum elasticity range is less. 
• For indeterminate plants like cotton and Redgram, more branches will be produced by the 
crop. 
 3. Foraging area or soil cover 
• Crop should cover the soil as early as possible so as to intercept maximum sunlight. 
• Higher the intercepted radiation more will be the dry matter produced. 
• Close spaced crops intercept more solar radiation than wide spaced crops. 
4. Dry matter partitioning 
• Dry matter production is related to amount of solar radiation intercepted by the canopy 
which depends on plant density. 
• As the plant density increases, the canopy expands more rapidly, more radiation is 
intercepted and more dry matter is produced. 
5. Crop and variety 
 
Depending on the crops and varieties, the plant population varies.  
 
Rice 
: 
Short duration  - 
6,66,666 plants/ha (15 cm x 10 cm) 
 
 
 
Medium 
 - 
5,00,000 plants/ha 
(20 cm x 10 cm) 
 
 
 
Long  
- 
3,33,000 plants/ha (20 cm x 15 cm) 
 
Cotton : 
Medium 
- 
55,555 plants/ha (60 cm x 30 cm) 
 
 
 
Long  
- 
44444 plants/ha (75 cm x 30 cm) 
 
 
 
Hybrids 
- 
18,518 plants/ha (120 cm x 45 cm) 
 
Maize : 
Varieties 
-  
83,333 plants/ha (60 x 20 cm) 
 
 
 
Hybrids           -           47,620 plants/ha (60 x 35 cm) 
B. Environmental factors 
1. Time of sowing  
• The crop is subjected to various weather conditions when sown at different periods. 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology

5
•  Among weather factors, day length and temperature influence much on the plant 
population. As low temperature retards growth, high plant population is required to cover 
the soil. 
2. Rainfall / irrigation 
1. Plant population has to be less under rainfed than irrigated condition. 
2. Under more plant densities, more water is lost through transpiration. 
3. Under adequate rainfall / irrigation, high plant population is recommended. 
3. Fertilizer application 
1. Higher plant population is necessary to fully utilize higher level of nutrients in the soil to 
realize higher yield. 
2. Nutrient uptake increases at optimum plant population. 
3. High population under low fertility soils leads to nutrient deficiency symptoms leading low 
yield. 
4. Seed rate 
• Quantity of seed sown/unit area, viability and establishment rate decides the plant 
population. Under broadcasting the seed rate is higher when compared with line 
sowing/transplanting, Ex. Rice. 
 
Direct sowing - 100 kg/ha; Line sowing - 60 kg/ha;  Transplanting - 40 kg/ha. 
PLANT GEOMETRY   
The arrangement of the plants in different rows and columns in an area to utilize the natural 
resources efficiently is called crop geometry. It is otherwise area occupied by a single plant Ex.. 
Rice – 20 cm x 15 cm.  This is very essential to utilize the resources like light, water, nutrient and 
space. Different geometries are available for crop production 
Different crop geometries are available for crop production 
1) Random plant geometry  
Random plant geometry results due to broadcasting method of sowing and no equal space is 
maintained. Resources are either under utilized or over exploited. 
2) Square plant geometry  
The plants are sown at equal distances on either side. Mostly perennial crops, tree crops 
follow square method of cultivation. Ex. Coconut – 7.5 x 7.5 m; banana – 1.8 x 1.8 m. But, due to 
scientific invention, the square geometry concept is expanded to close spaced field crops like rice 
too.  
Advantages  
Light is uniformly available, movement of wind is not blocked and mechanization can be 
possible. 
3) Rectangular method of sowing  
There are rows and columns, the row spacing are wider than the spacing between plants.  
 The different types exist in rectangular method are,  
a) Solid row: Each row will have no proper spacing between the plants.  This is followed only for 
annual crops which have tillering pattern. There is definite row arrangement but no column 
arrangement, Ex. Wheat. 
b) Paired row arrangement: It is also a rectangular arrangement.  It a crop requires 60 cm x 30 cm 
spacing and if paired row is to be adopted the spacing is altered to 90 cm instead of 60 cm in order 
to accommodate an intercrop.  The base population is kept constant. 
c) Skip row: A row of planting is skipped and hence there is a reduction in population. This 
reduction is compensated by planting an intercrop; practiced in rainfed or dryland agriculture. 
d) Triangular method of planting: It is recommended for wide spaced crops like coconut, mango, 
etc.  The number of plants per unit area is more in this system.

Role of manures and fertilizers in crop production – agronomic interventions 
for enhancing FUE - Inter cultivation - Thinning - Gap filling and other 
intercultural operations 
MANURES 
 
Manures are plant and animal wastes that are used as source of plant 
nutrients. They release nutrients after their decomposition. Manures can be grouped 
into bulky organic manures and concentrated organic manures. 
a. Bulky organic manures - Farm Yard Manure (FYM), compost from organic 
waste, night soil, sludge, sewage, green manures. 
b. Concentrated organic manures - oilcakes (edible, non-edible), blood meal, 
fishmeal and bone meal. 
FERTILIZERS  
 
Fertilizers are industrially manufactured chemical containing plant nutrients. 
Nutrient content is higher in fertilizers than organic manures and nutrients are 
released almost immediately. The fertilizers has three groups;  
Straight fertilizers – supplies single nutrient Ex: Urea, Muriate of Potash 
Complex fertilizers - supplies two or more nutrient Ex: 17:17:17 NPK complex 
Mixed fertilizers- supplies two or more nutrient Ex: Groundnut mixture  
ROLE OF MANURES AND FERTILIZERS  
1. Organic manures bind the sandy soil and improve its water holding capacity.  
2. Organic manures open the clayey soil and help in aeration for better root growth.  
3. Organic manures add plant nutrients in small percentage and also add 
micronutrients, which are essential for plant growth.  
4. Manures increases the microbial activity which helps in releasing plant nutrients 
to available form.  
5. Organic manures should be incorporated before the sowing or planting because 
of slow release of nutrients. 
6. Fertilizers play an important role in crop production as they supply large 
quantities of essential nutrient to crops 
7. Fertilizers are manufactured in forms that are readily utilized by plants directly or 
after rapid transformation.  
8. Fertilizers dose can be adjusted to suit the requirement as determined by soil 
testing.  
9. Balanced application of nutrient based on crop requirement is possible by 
appropriate mixing of fertilizers. 
10. Fertilizers applied as straight fertilizers (providing single nutrient) or complex and 
mixed fertilizers (supplies two or more nutrients) based on crop requirement. 
AGRONOMIC INTERVENTIONS FOR ENHANCING FUE 
 
The following are the agronomic measures to improve the Fertilizer use 
efficiency (FUE). 
1. Using best fertilizer source 
2. Using adequate rate & diagnostic techniques 
3. Usage of balanced fertilization 
4. Integrated nutrient management 
5. Utilization of residual nutrients 
1. Using best fertilizer source: 
Lecture 12
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 63 of 200.

Identification of best source of fertilizer is pre-requisite for better crop 
production. Source of fertilizer depends on crop and variety, climatic and soil 
condition, availability of fertilizer, etc.  
• Nitrogen: Ammoniacal or Nitrate 
• Phosphorus: Water soluble or Citrate soluble 
• Potassium: Muriate of potash 
• Sulphur: Sulphate or Elemental S 
• Multinutrient fertilizers: MAP, DAP, SSP, Nitrophosphates 
• Multi-nutrient mixtures: Several combinations of NPK 
• Fortified fertilizers: Neem-coated urea, Zincated urea, Boronated SSP, NPKS 
mix. 
 
2. Using adequate rate & diagnostic techniques:  
The fertilizer recommendation must be in adequate quantity so as to meet the 
demand of crop at any point of growth. The fertilizer supply is made by diagnosing 
its requirement by any of the following method.  
• State recommended generalized fertilizer dose or blanket recommendation 
• Soil-test based fertilizer recommendations  
• Soil-test crop response based recommendation  
• Plant analysis for diagnosing nutrient deficiencies 
• Chlorophyll meter and Leaf colour charts, etc.  
3. Balanced fertilization  
Balanced fertilization includes adequate supply of all essential nutrients, proper 
method of application, right time of application and nutrient interrelationships. 
a. Adequate supply of all essential nutrients: Due to more concentration and 
application on primary nutrients (NPK), soils developed deficiency symptoms for 
secondary and micro-nutrients. Hence, ignored elements must be added with the 
NPK (may be in minor quantity) to get higher yields in crops. Experimental results 
shown that about 20-25 kg of micro-nutrient application or two foliar sprays 
increases the yield of crops up to 20%. 
b. Proper method: N and K can be applied as broadcasting and band placement. 
Water soluble P fertilizers are preferred to apply as band placement in neutral & 
alkaline soils. Citrate soluble P fertilizers are applied as broadcast method in acidic 
soils. Sulphate forms of S fertilizers are applied as broadcasting or band placement, 
whereas, elemental S and pyrite are applied as broadcasting method. Micronutrients 
are applied in minor quantity as foliar sprays and water soluble fertilizers are applied 
in fertigation. 
c. Right time: (according to physiology of crop) 
• Upland crops - 2 splits (seeding, 3-5 weeks after first dose) 
• Flooded rice - 3 splits (Transplanting, 3 and 6 weeks after first dose)  
d. Nutrient interrelationships: 
 
Antagonistic nature of fertilizers is to be considered while applying into the 
soil. Some of the fertilizer application in excess, cause loss of yield and quality of 
crops. Ex. Application of excessive 120 kg P ha-1 created an imbalance and reduced 
the seed and oil yields in soybean compared to 80 kg P ha-1.  
4. Integrated nutrient management 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 64 of 200.

Organic manures, crop residues, green manures, bio-fertilizers etc. are to be 
blended in right manner along with inorganic fertilizers to meet the crop demand. All 
the possible and available organic sources are to be utilized efficiently to reduce the 
usage of inorganic fertilizers.   
5. Utilization of residual nutrients 
 
Some of the strategies to utilize the crop residues in efficient manner are,  
• Knowledge on climatic conditions & carry-over effects of residues.  
• Blending rightly on cereal-legume rotations 
• Mixing shallow-deep rooted crop rotations 
INTER CULTIVATION  
Cultivation practices taken up after sowing of crop is called inter-cultivation. It 
is otherwise called as after operation. There are three important after cultivation 
processes viz., Thinning and gap filling, weeding and hoeing and earthing up. 
 
1. Thinning and Gap filling 
The objective of thinning and gap filling process is to maintain optimum plant 
population. Thinning is the removal of excess plants leaving healthy seedlings. Gap 
filling is done to fill the gaps by sowing of seeds or transplanting of seedlings in gap 
where early sown seed had not germinated. It is a simultaneous process. Normally, 
these are practiced a week after sowing to a maximum of 15 days. In dryland 
agriculture, gap filling is done first. Seeds are dibbled after 7 days of sowing. 
Thinning is done after gap filling; in order to avoid drought. It is a management 
strategy to remove a portion of plant population to mitigate stress is referred to as 
mid season correction. 
2. Weeding and Hoeing 
Weeding is removal of unwanted plants. Weeding and hoeing is a 
simultaneous operation. Hoeing is disturbing the top soil by small hand tools and 
helps in aerating the soil. 
3. Earthing up 
  It is a dislocation of soil from one side of a ridge and to be placed nearer the 
cropped side. It is carried out in wide spaced and deep rooted crops. It is done 
around 6-8 weeks after sowing / planting in sugarcane, tapioca, banana, etc. 
4. Other inter cultivation practices 
Harrowing  
Stirring or scraping the surface soil in inter and intra row spacing of the crop 
using tools or implements. 
Roguing 
   
Removal of plants of a variety admixed with other variety of same crop.  Ex. 
In IR 50 rice field, the other rice varieties are rogue.  It is practiced in seed 
production to maintain purity. 
Topping 
Removal of terminal buds.  It is done to stimulate auxillary growth. Practiced 
in cotton and tobacco. 
Propping 
Provision of support to the crop is called propping. Practiced in sugarcane 
commonly.  It is done to prevent lodging of the crop.  Cane stalks from adjacent rows 
are brought together and tied with their own trash and old leaves. 
De-trashing

Removing of older leaves from the sugarcane crop. 
De-suckering 
Removal of axillary buds and branches which are considered non essential 
for crop production and which removes plant nutrients considerably are called 
suckers. Ex. Tobacco.

Irrigation - Time and methods - Modern techniques of irrigation - Drainage and its 
importance 
IRRIGATION 
Irrigation is defined as the artificial application of water to the soil for the purpose of crop 
production in supplement to rainfall and ground water contribution. 
Importance of water to plants 
1. Plants contain 90% water which gives turgidity and keeps them erect 
2. Water is an essential part of protoplasm 
3. It regulates the temperature of the plant system  
4. It is essential to meet the transpiration requirements 
5. It serves as a medium for dissolving the nutrients present in the soil 
6. It is an important ingredient in photosynthesis 
TIME OF IRRIGATION  
 
Crops draw water from the moisture stored in the soil. When the moisture present in the 
soil is low, then the plant requirements are not met with. When the soil is supplied with moisture 
in excess the supply of air is reduced that limits the plants growth. In between, there is a range of 
moisture content that is called as optimum soil moisture range for plant growth. 
 
The upper limit of the optimum soil moisture range is the field capacity (-0.01 to -0.03 
Mpa) and the lower limit is just above the wilting point (-1.5 Mpa). The objective of irrigation is 
to store the moisture in the soil between these limits. Immediately after irrigation, all the macro 
and micropores will be filled with water. All the water present in macropores will drain to subsoil 
within 48 hours and moisture in micropores will be available to plants. 
 
As the soil dries due to loss of water by evaporation and transpiration, the plant wilts 
during day time to conserve moisture and become normal at night. When the same condition 
continues, the plant will wilt without dieing. This condition is called as wilting coefficient. The 
irrigation is given whenever plants require water. This is decided by the crop and soil appearance. 
IRRIGATION METHODS 
1. Surface  
 
2. Sub-surface  
3. Pressurized irrigation 
Criteria for selection of irrigation method 
• Water supply source 
• Topography 
• Quantity of water to be applied 
• The crop  
• Method of cultivation 
Surface irrigation methods 
 
Oldest (4000 years back) and most common method. 90% of world’s total irrigated area is 
under this method. In USA also, 66% is by surface irrigation. This method is most suitable for low 
to moderate infiltration rates and leveled lands and having <2-3% slope. It is labour intensive. 
 
Surface is grouped as Border, check basin and furrow irrigations. Border is again classified 
in to two as straight and contour. Check basins may be of rectangular, contour or ring, furrow 
irrigation is classified as deep furrow and corrugated furrows. These may be again straight or 
contour according to direction and leveled and graded as per their elevation. 
1. Border irrigation 
 
The land is divided into number of long parallel strips called borders. These borders are 
separated by low ridges. The border strip has a uniform gentle slope in the direction of irrigation. 
Each strip is irrigated independently by turning the water in the upper end. The water spreads and 
flows down the strip in a sheet confined by the border ridges. 
Lecture 13
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology

Page 67 of 200.

 Suitability: Suitable to soils having moderately low to moderately high infiltration rates.  It is not 
used in coarse sandy soils that have very high infiltration rates and also in heavy soils having very 
low infiltration rate. Suitable to irrigate all close growing crops like wheat, barley, fodder crops 
and legumes and not suitable for rice 
Advantages 
a) Border ridges can be constructed with simple farm implements like bullock drawn “A” 
frame ridger or bund former. 
b) Labour requirement in irrigation is reduced as compared to conventional check basin 
method.  
c) Uniform distribution of water and high water application efficiencies are possible. 
d) Large irrigation streams can be efficiently used. 
e) Adequate surface drainage is provided if outlets are available. 
 
 
2. Check basin irrigation 
 
It is the most common surface irrigation method. Here, the field is divided into smaller unit 
areas so that each has a nearly level surface. Bunds or ridges are constructed around the area 
forming basins within which the irrigation water can be controlled. The water applied to a desired 
depth can be retained until it infiltrates into the soil. The size of the basin varies from 10 m2 to 25 
m2 depending upon soil type, topography, stream size and crop. 
Adaptability 
• Small gentle and uniform land slopes and soils having moderate to low infiltration rates.   
• Adapted to grain and fodder crops in heavy soils and suitable to permeable soils 
Advantages 
• Check basins are useful when leaching is required to remove salts from the soil profile. 
• Rainfall can be conserved and soil erosion is reduced by retaining large part of rain 
• High water application and distribution efficiency.

• The ridges interfere with the movement of implements. 
• More area occupied by ridges and field channels. 
• The method impedes surface drainage 
• Precise land grading and shaping are required 
• Labour requirement is higher. 
• Not suitable for crops which are sensitive to wet soil conditions around the stem 
3. Furrow irrigation 
 
It is used for row crops. The furrows are formed between crop rows. The dimension of 
furrows depend on the crop grown, equipment used and soil type. Water is applied by small 
running streams in furrows between the crop rows. Water infiltrates into soil and spreads laterally 
to wet the area between the furrows. In heavy soils, furrows can be used to dispose the excess 
water. 
Adaptability 
• Method used for wide spaced row crops including vegetables. 
• Suitable for maize, sorghum, sugarcane, cotton, tobacco, groundnut, potatoes  
• Suitable to most soils except sandy.  
Advantages 
• Water in furrows contacts only 1/2 to 1/5 of the land surface. 
• Labour requirement for land preparation and irrigation is reduced. 
• Compared to check basins, there is less wastage of land in field ditches 
 
There are three types of furrow irrigation, they are, all furrow irrigation, alternate furrow 
irrigation and skip furrow irrigation 
4. Surge irrigation 
• Surge irrigation is the application of water into the furrows intermittently in a series of 
relatively short ON and OFF times of irrigation cycle.  
• It has been found that intermittent application of water reduces the infiltration rate over 
surges thereby the water front advances quickly. Hence, reduced net irrigation water 
requirement.  
• This also results in more uniform soil moisture distribution and storage in the crop root 
zone compared to continuous flow.  
• The irrigation efficiency is in between 85 and 90%.  
II. SUB-SURFACE IRRIGATION 
 
In subsurface irrigation, water is applied beneath the ground by creating and maintaining 
an artificial water table at some depth, usually 30-75 cm below the ground surface. Moisture 
moves upwards towards the land surface through capillary action. Water is applied through 
underground field trenches laid 15-30 m apart. Open ditches are preferred because they are 
relatively cheaper and suitable to all types of soil.  The irrigation water should be of good quality 
to prevent soil salinity. 
Advantages 
• Minimum water requirement for raising crops 
• Minimum evaporation and deep percolation losses 
• No wastage of land 
• No interference to movement of farm machinery 
• Cultivation operations can be carried out without concern for the irrigation period. 
Disadvantages 
• Requires a special combination of natural conditions.

• There is danger of water logging 
• Possibility of choking of the pipes lay underground. 
• High cost. 
III. PRESSURIZED OR MODERN IRRIGATION SYSTEMS 
a. Drip irrigation system 
Or trickle irrigation is one of the latest and modern methods of irrigation. It is suitable for 
water scarcity and salt affected soils. Water is applied in the root zone of the crop. Standard water 
quality test needed for design and operation of drip irrigation system. 
Drip components 
• A drip irrigation system consists of a pump or overhead tank, main line, sub-mains, laterals 
and emitters. 
• The mainline delivers water to the sub-mains and the sub-mains into the laterals. 
• The emitters which are attached to the laterals distribute water for irrigation. 
• The mains, sub-mains are usually made of PVC (poly vinyl chloride) pipes and and laterals 
of LLDPE tubes.  The emitters are also made of PVC material. 
• The other components include pressure regulator, filters, valves, water meter, fertilizer 
application devices etc. 
Advantages of drip irrigation 
• High water use efficiency (~95%, compared to less than 50% in surface) 
•  Flexibility of wetted area 
•  Versatile selection of emitters: type, discharge rate, position 
•  Economy in weed control 
•  Low interference with cultivation 
•  Day and night irrigation 
•  Prevention of leaf wetting 
•  Energy saving 
•  Salinity control 
•  Irrigation at variable topographic conditions. 
Limitation of drip Irrigation 
• High investment 
•  High level of knowledge for optimal and economical operation 
•  Susceptibility to mechanical damage 
•  Large number of emitters 
•  Long application time 
•  High level of filtration and other controls 
•  Maintenance.  
b. Sprinkler irrigation system 
 
This is another important modern irrigation techniques followed all over the globe. 
Sprinkler irrigation is application simulating rainfall overhead so overhead sprinklers. The 
sprinkler (overhead or pressure) irrigation system conveys water to the field through pipes 
(aluminium or PVC) under pressure with a system of nozzles. This system is designed to distribute 
the required depth of water uniformly, which is not possible in surface irrigation.  Water is applied 
at a rate less than the infiltration rate of the soil hence the runoff from irrigation is avoided. 
Types of sprinkler system 
On the basis of arrangement for spraying irrigation water, they are classified as, rotating 
head (or) revolving sprinkler system and perforated pipe system 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 70 of 200.

Based on the portability, sprinkler systems are classified as, portable system, semi 
permanent system, solid set system and permanent system.  
Advantages of sprinkler 
• Suitable for undulating topography (sloppy lands) 
• Water saving (35-40%) compared to surface irrigation methods.  
• Fertilizers and other chemicals can be applied through irrigation water 
• Saving in fertilizers, even distribution and avoids wastage. 
• Reduces erosion 
• Suitable for coarse textured soils (sandy soils) 
• Frost control - protect crops against frost and high temperature 
• Drainage problems eliminated 
• Saving in land  
Limitations 
• High initial cost 
• Efficiency is affected by wind 
• Higher evaporation losses in spraying water 
• Not suitable for tall crops like sugarcane 
• Not suitable for heavy clay soils 
• Poor quality water can not be used (Sensitivity of crop to saline water and clogging of 
nozzles) 
Drainage 
 
Drainage is the artificial removal of water in excess of the quantity required for the crop.  
Drainage includes removal of excess water of both surface and subsurface in the root zone of 
crops. Irrigation and drainage go together and are not mutually exclusive.  Irrigation aims at 
supplying optimum quantities of water throughout the crop period, whereas, drainage aims at 
removing excess quantity of water in a short time. Often, both may be required together to assure 
sustained and high level production of crops.  
Role of drainage  
• 
Draining the land provides conditions favorable for crop production.  
• 
The greatest benefit of drainage relates to aeration. Good drainage facilitates the ready 
diffusion of oxygen to the root zone and escape of carbon dioxide from the root zone into the 
atmosphere. Several harmful gases also escape from the root zone into the atmosphere.  
• 
The activity of aerobic organisms which influence the availability of nutrients such as nitrogen 
and sulphur to plants depends on soil aeration and hence, drainage improves aerobic 
organisms.  
• 
Toxicity in acid soils due to excess iron and manganese is decreased by drainage (due to 
presence of oxygen in the root zone).  
• 
Drainage permits roots to grow deeper and spread wider thereby increasing the volume of soil 
from which nutrients can be extracted.  
• 
The removal of excess water helps in drying of the soil quickly and optimum soil temperature 
permits timeliness of field operations.  
• 
The provision of a good drainage system permits the removal of excess salts in the soil or 
irrigation water and prevents their build up in the upper soil layers.

PLANTING GEOMETRY AND ITS EFFECT ON GROWTH AND YIELD 
Methods of Sowing and Transplanting  
1. 
Broadcasting 
2. 
Dibbling 
3. 
Sowi ng behind the country plough (manual and mechanical drilling) 
4. 
Seed Drilling 
5. 
Nursery transplanting 
1) 
Broadcasting 
Literally means scattering the seeds.  Broadcasting is done for many crops.  
Broadcasting is mostly followed for small sized to medium sized crops.  This is the largest 
method of sowing followed in India since it is the easiest and cheapest and requires minimum 
labours.  To have optimum plant population in unit area certain rules should be followed. 
i) 
Only a skilled person should broadcast the seeds for uniform scattering 
ii) 
The ploughed field should be in a perfect condition to trigger germination 
The seeds are broadcasted in a narrow strip and the sowing is completed strip by strip.  
To ensure a good and uniform population, it is better to broadcast on either direction.  This is 
called criss-cross sowing.  If the seed is too small, it is mixed with sand to make a bulky one and 
for easy handling.  In certain cases the person sowing will be beating the seeds against the 
basket for uniform scattering.  After broadcasting the seeds are covered gently either using a 
country plough with a very shallow ploughing or some wooden planks (boards / levelers) are 
used to cover the surface.  In some cases tree twigs or shrub branches are used.  If the seeds 
are large, levelers collect the seeds and leave in the other side.  Comb harrow is the best used 
one. 
Disadvantages 
1) 
All the seeds broadcasted do not have contact with the soil.  100% germination is not 
possible. 
Lecture 14
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology

Page 72 of 200.

2) 
Seed rate is not sufficient.  Enhanced seed rate required 
3) 
Seeds cannot be placed in desired depth.  Desired depth ensures perfect anchorage.  
Lodging (falling down) is common in broadcasting 
2) 
Dibbling 
Line sowing:  Inserting a seed through a hole at a desired depth and covering the hole.  
Dibbling on plain surface and ridges and furrows or beds and channels.This types of sowing is 
practiced only under suitable soil condition.  Rice – fallow – cotton is dibbled on a plain surface.  
The seeds are dibbled at 2/3rd from top or 1/3rd at bottom.  Before sowing furrows are opened 
and fertilizers are applied above which seeds are sown.  The seeds do not have contact with the 
fertilizers.  This is done for wider spaced crops and medium to large sized seeds, e.g., sorghum, 
maize, sunflower, cotton are dibbled on ridges and furrows.  Both beds and channels and ridges 
and furrows come under line sowing.  While earthing up the plant occupies middle of the ridge.  
Earthing up is essential for proper anchorage of the root system. 
Advantages of ridges and furrows 
(i) 
 Uniform population 
(ii) 
 Better germination 
(iii) 
 Reduced seed rate. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3) 
Sowing behind the plough 
Sowing behind the plough (line sowing) is done manually or mechanical means.  Seeds 
are dropped in the furrows opened by the plough and the same is closed or covered when the 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology

Page 73 of 200.

next furrow is opened.  The seeds are sown at uniform distance.  Manual method is a laborious 
and time consuming process.  Seeds like redgram, cowpea and groundnut are sown behind the 
country plough.  Major sown crop is ground out.  Seeds are sown by mechanical means by 
‘Gorus’ – seed drill.  A seed drill has a plough share and hopper.  Seeds are placed on hopper.  
Different types of seed drill are available, e.g., simple Goru – Guntakas. 
Advantages – i) The seeds are placed at desired depth covered by iron planks, ii) 
except very small, very large seeds most of the seeds can be sown, e.g. maize, sorghum, 
millets, sunflower, etc.

4. Drill Sowing (or) Drilling 
 
Drilling is the practice of dropping seeds in a definite depth covered with soil and 
compacted. In this method, sowing implements are used for placing the seeds into the soil. Both 
animal drawn gorrus and power operated (seed drills) implements are available. Seeds are 
drilled continuously or at regular intervals in rows. In this method, depth of sowing can be 
maintained and fertilizer can also be applied simultaneously. It is possible to take up sowing of 
inter crops also. It requires more time, energy and cost, but maintains uniform population per 
unit area Seeds are placed at uniform depth, covered and compacted

5) Nursery Transplanting 
In nursery, young seedlings are protected more effectively in a short period and in a 
smaller area.  Management is essential. 
Advantages 
i) 
Can ensure optimum plant population 
ii) 
Sowing of main field duration, i.e., management in the main field is reduced 
iii) 
Crop intensification is possible under transplanting 
Disadvantages 
i) 
Nursery raising is expensive 
ii) 
Transplanting is another laborious and expensive method 
Age – 1/4th of the total duration is on the nursery beds.  If the total duration is 16 weeks, 
four week period (1 month) is under nursery beds.  Nursery age is not very rigid, e.g., thumb 
rule – 3 months crop – nursery duration 3 weeks, minimum 4 months – 4 weeks minimum 
period; 5 months – 5 weeks.  After the nursery period, seedlings are pulled out and 
transplanted.  This is done on the main field after thorough field preparation or optimum tilth.  
The seedlings are dibbled in lines or in random.  Closer spaced crops are mostly raised in 
random method even after nursery, e.g. rice, ragi.  For vegetables, desired spacing is required 
during transplanting.  Transplanting shock is a period after transplanting, the seedlings show no 
growth.  This is mostly due to the change in the environment between root and the soil.  The 
newly planted seedlings should adjust with new environment.  It is for a period of 5 – 7 days 
depending upon season, crop, variety, etc.  At higher temperature – dehydration – leaves dry 
out.  Area: normally 1/10th of the total area is required for nursery. 
Plant Population or Plant Density 
Number of plants per unit area in the cropped field is the plant population. 
Optimum plant population 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 75 of 200.

1. Optimum plant population – It is the number of plants required to produce maximum 
output or biomass per unit area.   
2. Any increase beyond this stage results in either no increase or reduction in biomass. 
Crop Geometry   
The arrangement of the plants in different rows and columns in an area to efficiently utilize the 
natural resources is called crop geometry.It is otherwise area occupied by a single plant e.g. 
rice – 20 cm x 15 cm.  This is very essential to utilize the resources like light, water, nutrient and 
space.Different geometries are available for crop production 
Importance of plant population / crop geometry   
1. Yield of any crop depends on final plant population  
2. The plant population depends on germination percentage and survival rate in the field  
3. Under rain fed conditions, high plant population will deplete the soil moisture before 
maturity, where as low plant population will leave the soil moisture unutilized 
4. When soil moisture and nutrients are not limited high plant population is necessary to utilize 
the other growth factors like solar radiation efficiently 
5. Under low plant population individual plant yield will be more due to wide spacing. 
6. Under high plant population individual plant yield will be low due to narrow spacing leading 
to competition between plants. 
7. Yield per plant decreases gradually as plant population per unit area is increased, but yield 
per unit area increases upto certain level of population 
8. That level of plant population is called as optimum population 
9. So to get maximum yield per unit area, optimum plant population is necessary. So the 
optimum plant population for each crop should be identified. 
Factors affecting plant population 
Genetic Factors 
1. Size of the plant  
2. Elasticity of the plant 
3.Foraging area or soil cover 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 76 of 200.

4. Dry matter partitioning  
Environmental factors 
1. Time of sowing  
2. Rainfall / Irrigation.  3.Fertilizer application 
4. Seed rate 
1. Size of the plant 
1. The volume occupied by the plant at the time of flowering decides the spacing of the 
crop 
2. Plants of red gram, cotton, sugarcane  etc occupy larger volume of space in the field 
compared to rice, wheat, ragi 
3. Even the varieties of the same crop differ in size of the plant  
2. Elasticity of the plant 
1. Variation in size of the plant between minimum size of the plant that can produce some 
economic yield to the maximum size of the plant that can reach under unlimited space 
and resources is the elasticity  of the plant. 
2. The optimum plant population range is high in indeterminate plants 
 
Eg :  Opt. population range for redgram is 55000-133, 000 plants/ha 
3. The elasticity is due to tillering and branching habit of the plants 
4. For determinate plants like bajra, sorghum elasticity range is less  
5. For indeterminate plants like cotton and redgram more branches will be produced the 
crop 
 3. Foraging area or soil cover 
1. should cover the soil as early as possible so as to intercept maximum sunlight 
2. Higher the intercepted radiation more will be the dry matter produced 
3. Close spaced crops intercept more Solar radiation than wide spaced crops 
4. Dry matter partitioning 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 77 of 200.

1. Dry matter production is related to amount of solar radiation intercepted by the canopy 
which depends on plant density 
2. As the plant density increases the canopy expands more rapidly, more radiation is 
intercepted and more dry matter is produced. 
5. Crop and variety 
 
Rice 
: 
Short duration - 
15 cm x 10 cm - 6,66,666 pl/ha 
 
 
 
Medium 
- 
20 cm x 10 cm -5,00,000 pl/ha 
 
 
 
 
Long  
- 
20 cm x 15 cm -3,33,000 pl/ha 
 
Cotton : 
Medium 
- 
60 cm x 30 cm 
 
 
 
Long  
- 
75 cm x 30 cm 
 
 
 
Hybrids 
- 
120 cm x 45 cm 
 
Maize : 
60 x 20 cm (varieties) 
 
 
 
60 x 35 cm (hybrids) 
Environmental factors 
1. Time of sowing  
1. The crop is subjected to various weather conditions when sown at different 
periods. 
2.  Among weather factors, day length and temperature influence the plant 
population. As low temperature retards growth, high plant population is required 
to cover the soil 
2. Rainfall / irrigation 
1. Plant population has to be less under rainfed than irrigated  condition 
2. Under more plant densities, more water is lost through transpiration 
3. Under adequate rainfall / irrigation, high plant population is recommended. 
3. Fertilizer application 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 78 of 200.

1. Higher plant population is necessary to fully utilize higher level of nutrients in the soil to 
realize higher yield. 
2. Nutrient uptake increases with in plant population 
3. High population under low fertility soil leads to nutrient deficiency symptoms leading low 
yield 
4. Seed rate 
1. Quantity of seed sown/unit area, viability and establishment rate decides the plant 
population  Under broadcasting the seed rate is higher when compared with line 
sowing/transplanting, e.g. for rice 
 
Direct sowing - 
100 kg/ha 
 
Line sowing 
- 
60 kg/ha 
 
Transplanting - 
40 kg/ha 
Different crop geometries are available for crop production 
1) Broadcasting  
 Results in random geometry, no equal space is maintained, resources are either under 
exploited or over exploited. 
2) Square method or square geometry  
The plants are sown at equal distances on either side.  Mostly perennial crops, tree crops follow 
square method of cultivation. 
Advantages  
i) 
Light is uniformly available, 
ii) 
Movement of wind is not blocked and  
iii) 
Mechanization can be possible.

3) Rectangular method of sowing  
 
There are rows and columns, the row spacing are wider than the spacing between 
plants.  The different types exist in rectangular method 
a) Solid row – Each row will have no proper spacing between the plants.  This is followed only 
for annual crops which have tillering pattern.  There is definite row arrangement but no column 
arrangement, e.g., wheat. 
b) Paired row arrangement – It is also a rectangular arrangement.  It a crop requires 60 cm x 
300 m spacing and if paired row is to be adopted the spacing is altered to 90 cm instead of 60 
cm in order to accommodate an intercrop.  The base population is kept constant. 
 
 
SPRING MAIZE INTER-CROP IN PAIRED 
ROW PLANTING 
 
 
 
 
c) Skip row – A row of planting is skipped and hence there is a reduction in population.  This 
reduction is compensated by planting an intercrop; practiced in rainfed or dryland agriculture.

Conventional planting on the left, compared with plant1 – skip1 on the right 
d) Triangular method of planting - It is recommended for wide spaced crops like coconut, 
mango, etc.  The number of plants per unit area is more in this system.

Cropping pattern and cropping system - Intensive cropping- Sustainable agriculture – IFS 
 
CROPPING PATTERN AND CROPPING SYSTEM 
 
Traditionally, increased food production has come from putting more land under 
cultivation.  However, in large areas of the world, especially in Asia, all the land that can be 
economically cultivated is already in use.  In future, most of the extra food needs must come from 
higher production from land already being farmed.  A major share of this increase is likely to 
come from increasing the number of crops produced per year on a given land using improved crop 
cultivars.  Such multiple cropping offers potential not only to increase food production but also 
land degradation. 
 
In India, the concept of cropping systems is as old as agriculture.  Farmers preferred mixed 
cropping, especially under dry land conditions, to minimise the risk of total crop failure.  Even in 
Vedas, there is a mention of first and second crops, indicating the existence of sequential cropping. 
A system is defined as a set of components that are interrelated and interact among 
themselves.  A cropping system refers to a set of crop systems, making up the cropping activities 
of a farm system.  Cropping system comprises all components required for the production of a 
particular crop and the interrelationships between them and environment (TAC, CGIAR, 1978).  
In other words, a cropping system usually refers to a combination of crops in time and space.  
Combination in time occurs when crops occupy different growing period and combinations in 
space occur when crops are inter planted.  When annual crops are considered, a cropping system 
usually means the combination of crops within a given year (Willey et al., 1989 
Cropping pattern 
 
The yearly sequence and spatial arrangement of crops or of crops and fallow on a given 
area. 
Cropping system 
 
The cropping patterns used on a farm and their interaction with farm resources, other farm 
enterprises, and available technology which determine their make up. 
INTENSIVE CROPPING 
Principles 
 
The turn around period between one crop and another is minimised through modified land 
preparation.  It is possible when the resources are available in plenty.  Ex. Garden land cultivation. 
Cropping intensity is higher in intensive cropping system. Crop intensification technique includes 
intercropping, relay cropping, sequential cropping, ratoon cropping, etc. All such systems come 
under the general term multiple cropping. 
Need for intensive cropping 
• Cropping systems has to be evolved based on climate, soil and water availability for 
efficient use of available natural resources. 
• The increase in population has put pressure on land to increase productivity per unit area, 
unit time and for unit resource used. 
• This cropping system should provide enough food for the family, fodder for cattle and 
generate sufficient cash income for domestic and cultivation expenses. 
Intensive cropping: Growing number of crops on the same piece of land during the given period 
of time. 
Cropping intensity: Number of crops cultivated in a piece of land per annum is cropping 
intensity. In Punjab and Tamil Nadu, the cropping intensity is more than 100% (i.e. around 140-
150%). In Rajasthan, the cropping intensity is less. 
Lecture 15
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 82 of 200.

Multiple cropping: The intensification of cropping in time and space dimensions.  Growing two 
or more crops on the same field in a year. 
Forms of multiple cropping 
Intercropping: Growing two or more crops simultaneously on the same field. Crop intensification 
is in both time and space dimensions. There is intercrop competition during all or part of crop 
growth. 
(a) Mixed intercropping: Growing two or more crops simultaneously with no distinct row 
arrangement.  Also referred to as mixed cropping. Ex: Sorghum, pearl millet and cowpea 
are mixed and broadcasted in rainfed conditions. 
(b) Row intercropping: Growing two or more crops simultaneously where one or more crops 
are planted in rows.  Often simply referred to as intercropping. Maize + greengram (1:1), 
Maize + blackgram (1:1), Groundnut + Rredgram (6:1) 
(c) Strip intercropping: Growing two or more crops simultaneously in strips wide enough to 
permit independent cultivation but narrow enough for the crops to interact agronomically. 
Ex. Groundnut + redgram (6:4) strip. 
(d) Relay intercropping: Growing two or more crops simultaneously during the part of the life 
cycle of each.  A second crop is planted after the first crop has reached its reproductive 
stage of growth, but, before it is ready for harvest.  Often simply referred to as relay 
cropping. Rice- rice fallow pulse. 
Advantages of intercropping 
• 
Better use of growth resources including light, nutrients and water 
• 
Suppression of weeds 
• 
Yield stability; even if one crop fails due to unforeseen situations, another crop will yield 
and gives income 
• 
Successful intercropping gives higher equivalent yields (yield of base crop + yield of 
intercrop), higher cropping intensity 
• 
Reduced pest and disease incidences  
• 
Improvement of soil health and agro-eco system 
Sequential cropping: Growing two or more crops in sequence on the same field in a farming 
year. The succeeding crop is planted after the preceding crop has been harvested. Crop 
intensification is only in time dimension. There is no intercrop competition. 
(a) Double, triple and quadruple cropping: Growing two, three and four crops, respectively, 
on the same land in a year in sequence. 
Ex. Double cropping: Rice: cotton; Triple cropping: Rice: rice: pulses; Quadruple cropping: 
Tomato: ridge gourd: Amaranthus greens: baby corn 
(b) Ratoon cropping: The cultivation of crop re-growth after harvest, although not necessarily 
for grain. Ex. Sugarcane: ratoon; Sorghum: ratoon (for fodder). 
 
The various terms defined above bring out essentially two underlying principles, that of 
growing crops simultaneously in mixture, i.e., intercropping; and of growing individual crops in 
sequence, i.e., sequential cropping.  The cropping system for a region or farm may comprise either 
or both of these two principles. 
SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE 
Definition:  
A farming systems that are "capable of maintaining their productivity and usefulness to 
society indefinitely and must be resource-conserving, socially supportive, commercially 
competitive, and environmentally sound."  
 
 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology

USDA (legal)  
Sustainable agriculture means, an integrated system of plant and animal production 
practices having a site-specific application that will, over the long term: 
 satisfy human food and fiber needs; 
 enhance environmental quality and the natural resource based upon which the agricultural 
economy depends; 
 make the most efficient use of nonrenewable resources and on-farm resources and 
integrate, where appropriate, natural biological cycles and controls; 
 sustain the economic viability of farm operations;  
 enhance the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole. 
Advantages 
 Production cost is low 
 Over all risk of the farmer is reduced 
 Pollution of water is avoided  
 Very little or no pesticide residue is ensured 
 Ensures both short and long term profitability  
Disadvantages 
 Since sustainable agriculture uses least quantum of inputs, naturally the output (yield) may 
also be less.  
 
Major components of sustainable agricultural system  
• Soil and water conservation to prevent degradation of soil productivity 
• Efficient use of limited irrigation water without leading to problems of soil salinity, 
alkalinity and high ground water table 
• Crop rotations that mitigate weed, disease and insect problems, increase soil 
productivity and minimise soil erosion 
• Integrated nutrient management that reduces the need for chemical fertilizers improves 
the soil health and minimise environmental pollution by conjunctive use of organics, 
in-organics and bio-fertilizers. 
• ‘Integrated pest management that reduces the need for agrochemicals by crop rotation, 
weather monitoring, use of resistant cultivar, planting time and biological pest control. 
• Management system to control weed by preventive measures, tillage, timely inter 
cultivation and crop rotation to improve plant health. 
INTEGRATED FARMING SYSTEM (IFS) 
Integration of two or more appropriate combination of enterprises like crop, dairy, piggery, 
fishery, poultry, bee keeping etc., for each farm according to the availability of resources to 
sustain and satisfy the necessities of the farmer 
 
Definition: A farming system is a collection of distinct functional units such as crop, livestock, 
processing, investments and marketing activities which interact because of the joint use of inputs 
they receive from the environment which have the common objective of satisfying the farmers’ 
(decision makers) aims.  The definition of the borders of the options depends on circumstances; 
often it includes not only the farm (economic enterprise) but also the household (farm – household 
system)”

Organic / eco-friendly agriculture - Dry farming - Concepts and principles 
 
Organic farming: Organic farming is a production system where all kinds of agricultural 
products are produced organically, including grains, meat, dairy, eggs, fibers such as cotton, 
flowers and processed food products. 
Organic farming avoids or largely excludes the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, 
growth regulators and livestock feed additives. 
 
Need & scope of organic farming 
 Increase in awareness and health consciousness 
 Global consumers are increasingly looking for organic food, which is considered safe, and 
hazard free. 
 The global prices of organic food are more lucrative and remunerative. 
 The potential of organic farming is signified by the fact that the farm sector has abundant 
organic nutrient resources like livestock, water, crop residue, aquatic weeds, forest litter, 
urban, rural solid wastes and agro industries, bio-products. 
 India offers tremendous scope for organic farming as it has local market potential for 
organic products

Dryland Agriculture 
 
Indian agriculture is predominantly a rainfed agriculture under which both dryfarming and 
dryland agriculture are included. Out of the 143 million ha of total cultivated area in the country, 
101 million ha (i.e. nearly 70%) area are rainfed. In dryland areas, variation in amount and 
distribution of rainfall influence the crop production as well as socio-economic conditions of 
farmers. The dryland areas of the country contribute about 42% of the total food grain production. 
Most of the coarse grains like sorghum, pearl millet, finger millet and other millets are grown in 
drylands only. The attention has been paid in the country towards the development of dryland 
farming. Efforts were made to improve crop yields in research projects at Manjari, Solapur, 
Bijapur, Raichur and Rohtak. An all India co-ordinated research project for Dryland Agriculture 
was launched by ICAR in 1970 in collaboration with Government of Canada and later Central 
Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA) was established at Hyderabad.

Characteristics of Dryland Agriculture 
Dry land areas may be characterized by the following features, 
1. Uncertain, ill-distributed and limited annual rainfall 
2. Occurrence of extensive climatic hazards like drought, flood etc. 
3. Undulating soil surface 
4. Occurrence of extensive and large holdings 
5. Practice of extensive agriculture, i.e., prevalence of monocropping etc. 
6. Relatively large size of fields 
7. Similarity in types of crops raised by almost all the farmers of a particular region 
8. Very low crop yield 
9. Poor economy of the farmers

Improved dryland technologies 
Following are the various improved techniques and practices recommended for achieving the 
objective of increased and stable crop production in dryland areas. 
• Crop planning: Crop varieties for dryland areas should be of short duration through resistant 
tolerant and high yielding which can be harvested within rainfall periods and have sufficient 
residual moisture in soil profile for post-monsoon cropping. 
• Planning for weather: Variation in yields and output of the dryland agriculture is due to the 
observation in weather conditions especially rainfall. An aberrant weather can be categorized 
in three types viz., 
a. 
Delayed onset of monsoon. 
b. 
Long gaps or breaks in rainfall and 
c. 
Early cessation of rains towards the end of monsoon season.  
Farmers should make some changes in normal cropping schedule for getting some 
production in place of total crop failure. 
• Crop substitution: Traditional crops/varieties which are inefficient utilizer of soil moisture, 
less responsive to production input and potentially low producers should be substituted by 
more efficient ones. 
• Cropping systems: Increasing the cropping intensities by using the practice of intercropping 
and multiple cropping is the way of more efficient utilization of resources. The cropping 
intensity would depend on the length of growing season, which in turn depends on rainfall 
pattern and the soil moisture storage capacity of the soil. 
• Fertilizer use: The availability of nutrients is limited in drylands due to the limiting soil 
moisture. Therefore, application of the fertilizers should be done in furrows below the seed. 
The use of fertilizers is not only helpful in providing nutrients to crop but also, helpful in 
efficient use of soil moisture. A proper mixture of organic and inorganic fertilizers improves 
moisture holding capacity of soil and increase during tolerance. 
• Rain water management: Efficient rain water management can increase agricultural 
production from dryland areas. Application of compost and farm yard manure and raising 
legumes add the organic matter to the soil and increase the water holding capacity. The 
water, which is not retained by the soil, flows out as surface runoff. This excess runoff water 
can be harvested in storing dugout ponds and recycled to donar areas in the server stress 
during rainy season or for raising crops during winter. 
• Watershed management: Watershed management is a approach to optimize the use of land, 
water and vegetation in a area and thus, to provide solution drought, moderate floods, 
prevent soil erosion, improve water availability and increase fuel, fodder and agricultural 
production on a sustained basis. 
• Alternate Land use: All drylands are not suitable for crop production. Same lands may be 
suitable for range/ pasture management and for tree farming and ley farming, dryland 
horticulture, agro-forestry systems including alley cropping. All these systems which are 
alternative to crop production are called as alternate land use systems. This system helps to 
generate off-season employment mono-cropped dryland and also, minimizes risk, utilizes 
off-season rains, prevents degradation of soils and restores balance in the ecosystem. The 
different alternate land use systems are alley cropping, agri-horticultural systems and silvi-
pastoral systems, which utilizes the resources in better way for increased and stabilized 
production from drylands.

AGRO METEOROLOGY  
Meteorology 
 
Greek word “Meteoro” means ‘above the earth’s surface’ (atmosphere) “logy” means 
‘indicating science’. Branch of science dealing with that of atmosphere is known as 
meteorology. Lower atmosphere extending up to 20km from earth’s surface is where frequent 
physical process takes place. 
 
Meteorology is a combination of both physics and geography Meteorology is a 
combination of both physics and geography. This science utilizes the principles of Physics to 
study the behaviour of air. It is concerned with the analysis of individual weather elements for a 
shorter period over a smaller area. In other words, the physical state of the atmosphere at a 
given place and time is referred to as “weather”. The study of weather is called ‘meteorology’. It 
is often quoted as the “physics of atmosphere”. 
Weather: Physical state of the atmosphere at a given place and given time. Eg. Cloudy day 
Climate: Long term regime of atmospheric variables of a given place or area. Eg. Cold season 
Agricultural meteorology 
1. A branch of applied meteorology which investigates the physical conditions of the 
environment of growing plants or animal organisms 
2. An applied science which deals with the relationship between weather/climatic conditions and 
agricultural production. 
3. A science concerned with the application of meteorology to the measurement and analysis of 
the physical environment in agricultural systems. The word ‘Agro meteorology’ is the 
abbreviated form of agricultural meteorology. 
4. To study the interaction between meteorological and hydrological factors on the one hand 
and agriculture in the widest sense, including horticulture, animal husbandry and forestry on the 
other (WMO).

Earth is elliptical in shape and has three spheres 
 
Hydrosphere - the water portion 
 
Lithosphere - the solid portion 
 
Atmosphere - the gaseous portion 
Atmosphere 
The atmosphere is the colourless, odourless and tasteless physical mixture of gasses which 
surrounds earth on all sides. It is mobile, compressible and expandable. It contains huge 
number of solid and liquid particles called aerosol. Some gases are permanent atmospheric 
constituents in fixed proportions to the total gas volume. Others very from place and time to 
time. The lower atmosphere where the chemical composition of gas is uniform is called 
homosphere. At higher levels the chemical composition of air changes considerably and known 
as heterosphere. 
Uses of atmosphere 
1. Provides oxygen which is useful for respiration in crops 
2. Provides carbon-dioxide to build biomass in photosynthesis. 
3. Provides nitrogen which is essential for plant growth. 
4. Acts as a medium for transportation of pollen. 
5. Protects crops plants on earth from harmful U.V.rays. 
6. Maintains warmth to plant life and 
7. Provides rain to field crops as it is a source of water vapour, cloud, etc. 
Composition of atmosphere 
The following all the different gases that are present in percentage by volume approximately. 
Nitrogen (N2) = 78.08  
Oxygen (O2) = 20.95

Vertical Layers of atmosphere based on temperature 
On the basis of vertical temperature variation the atmosphere is divided into different spheres 
or layers. 
A. Troposphere 
1. The word “Trop” means mixing or turbulence and “sphere” means region. 
2. The average height o this lower most layer of the atmosphere is about 14 km above the men 
sea level; at the equator it is 16 km and 7-8 km at the poles. 
3. Under normal conditions the height of the troposphere changes from place to place and 
season to season. 
4. Various types of clouds, thunderstorms, cyclone and anticyclones occur in this sphere 
because of the concentration of almost all the water vapour and aerosols in it. So, this layer is 
called as “seat of weather phenomena”. 
5. The wind velocities increase with height and attain the maximum at the top of this layer. 
6. Another striking feature of the troposphere is that there is a decrease of temperature with 
increasing elevation at a mean lapse rate of about 6.5°C per km. 
7. Most of the radiation received from the sun is absorbed by the earth’s surface. So, the 
troposphere is heated from below. 
8. In this layer, about 75 per cent of total gases and most of the moisture and dust particles 
present. 
9. A the top of the troposphere there is a shallow layer separating it from the stratosphere which 
is known as the “Tropopasue “. 
10. The tropospause layer is thin and its height changes according to the latitudes and it is a 
transitional zone and distinctly characterized by no major movement of air.

B). Stratosphere 
1). This layer exists above the tropopause (around 20 km onwards) and extends to altitudes of 
about 50-55 km. 
2). This layer is called as “Seat of photochemical reactions” 
3). The temperature remains practically constant at around 20 km and is characterized as 
isothermal because air is thin, clear, cold and dry near tropopause. 
4). The temperature of this layer increases with height and also depends upon the troposphere 
because the troposphere is higher at the equator than at the poles. 
5). In the upper parts of the stratosphere the temperatures are almost as high as those near the 
earth’s surface, which is due to the fact that the ultra-violet radiation from the sun is absorbed by 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 99 of 200.

ozone in this region. The air density is so much less that even limited absorption of solar 
radiation by the atmospheric constituents notably ozone produces a temperature increase. 
6). Less convection takes place in the stratosphere because it is warm at the top and cold at the 
bottom.  
7). There is also persistence of circulation patterns and high wind speeds. 
8). The upper boundary of the stratosphere is called the stratopause. 
C). Mesosphere/Ozonosphere 
1. There is a maximum concentration of ozone between 30 and 60 km above the surface 
of the earth and this layer is known at the ozonosphere. 
2. A property of the ozone is that it absorbs UV rays. Had there been no layer of the ozone in 
the atmosphere, the ultraviolet rays might have reached the surface of the earth and no life can 
exist. 
3. Temperature of the ozonosphere is high (warm) due to selective absorption of U.V radiation 
by ozone. 
4. Because of the preponderance of chemical process this sphere is called as the 
“chemosphere” 
5. In this layer the temperature increases with height at the rate of 5°C per km. 
6. According to some leading scientists the ionosphere is supposed to start at a height of 80 km 
above the earth’s surface. The layer between 50 and 80 km is called as “Mesosphere”. In this 
layer the temperature decreases with height. The upper boundary of this layer is called the 
“Mesospause”. 
7. Mesosphere is the coldest region in the atmosphere with temperature reaching the lowest 
value of nearly -95°C at the mesopause (80km) 
D). Thermosphere(Ionosphere) 
1) The thermosphere layer lies beyond the ozonosphere (mesosphere) at a height of about 80 
km above the earth’s surface and extends upto 400 km. 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 100 of 200.

2) The atmosphere in the ionosphere is partly ionised enriched ion zones exist in the form of 
distinct ionised layers. So, this layer is called as the ionosphere. 
3) Above the mesosphere the temperature increases again and is in the order of 1000°C.  
4) The ionosphere reflects the radio waves because of one or multiple reflections of shortwave 
radio beams from the inoised shells. So, long distance radio communication is possible due to 
this layer. 
E). Exosphere. 
1) The outer most layer of the earth’s atmosphere is named as the exosphere and this layer lies 
between 400 and 1000 km. 
2) At such a greater height the density of atoms in the atmosphere is extremely low. 
3) Hydrogen and Helium gases predominate in this outer most region. 
4) At an altitude of about 500 to 600 km the density of the atmosphere becomes so low that 
collisions between the natural particles become extremely rare. 
Lapse rate 
The decrease in air temperature with height is known as the normal / environmental lapse rate 
and it is 6.5°C/km. 
Adiabatic lapse rate 
The rate of change of temperature in an ascending or descending air mass through adiabatic 
process is called as adiabatic lapse rate. The thermodynamic transformation which occurs 
without exchange of heat between a system and its environment is known as adiabatic process. 
In adiabatic process, adiabatic cooling accompanies expansion, and adiabatic warming 
accompanies compression.

Monsoon Rainfall Variability 
 
Indian continent receives its annual rainfall by the peculiar phenomenon known as 
monsoon. It consists of series of cyclones that arise in India Ocean. These travel in northeast 
direction and enter the Peninsular India along its west coast. The most important of these 
cyclones usually occur from June to September resulting in summer monsoon or southwest 
monsoon. This is followed by a second rainy season from October to December. A third and 
fourth rainy seasons occur from January to February and from March to May respectively. Of 
the four rainy seasons, southwest monsoon is the most important as it contribute 80 – 95% of 
the total rainfall of the country. 
Two types of monsoon systems are a) South West Monsoon, b) North East Monsoon. 
(a) South West Monsoon 
 
Beginning of the year temperature of the Indian Peninsular rapidly rises under the 
increasing heat of the sun. A minimum barometric pressure is established in the interior parts of 
the Peninsular by the month of March. Westerly winds prevail on the west Kerala and south 
winds on the west of northern Circars, Orissa and Bengal. During April and May the region of 
high temperature is shifted to north viz., upper Sind, lower Punjab and Western Rajasthan. This 
area becomes the minimum barometric pressure area to which monsoon winds are directed. 
 
The western branch of South West monsoon touches North Karnataka, Southern 
Maharashtra and then it make its way to Gujarat. When the South West Monsoon is fully 
operating on the Western India, another branch of the same is acting in the Bay of Bengal. It 
carries rains to Burma, Northern portions of the east coast of India, Bengal, Assam and the 
whole of North India in general. 
b) North east Monsoon 
 
During September end, the South West Monsoon penetrates to North Western India but 
stays on for a full month in Bengal. On account of the increase in barometric pressure in 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology

Page 102 of 200.

Northern India, there is a shift of the barometric pressure to the South East and North Easterly 
winds begin to flow on the eastern coast. These changes bring on heavy and continuous rainfall 
to the Southern and South Eastern India. 
c) Winter Rainfall 
 
It is restricted more to Northern India and is received in the form of snow on the hills and 
as rains in the plains of Punjab, Rajasthan and central India. Western disturbance is a dominant 
factor for rainfall during these months in northwestern India. 
d) Summer Rainfall 
 
The summer Rainfall is received from March to May as local storms. It is mostly received 
in the South East of Peninsular and in Bengal. Western India does not generally receive these 
rains.

WEATHER AND CLIMATE, MICRO-CLIMATE 
Weather  
i) ‘A state or condition of the atmosphere at a given place and at a given instant of time’. 
ii) ‘The daily or short term variations of different conditions of lower air in terms of temperature, 
pressure, wind, rainfall, etc’. 
iii) State of atmosphere at a particular time as defined by the various meteorological elements. 
(WMO) 
 
The aspects involved in weather include small areas and duration, expressed in 
numerical values, etc. The different weather elements are solar radiation, temperature, 
pressure, wind, humidity, rainfall evaporation, etc. is highly variable. It changes constantly 
sometimes from hour to hour and at other times from day to day. 
Climate 
i) ‘The generalized weather or summation of weather conditions over a given region during 
comparatively longer period’. 
ii) ‘The sum of all statistical information of weather in a particular area during a specified 
interval of time, usually, a season or a year or even a decade’. 
iii) Synthesis of weather conditions in a given area, characterized by long-term statistics (mean 
values, variances, probabilities of extreme values, etc,) of the meteorological elements in 
that area. (WMO) 
 
The aspects involved are larger areas like a zone, a state, a country and is described by 
normal. The climatic normals are generally worked out for a period of 30 years.

5. Selection of crops suitable for a place is 
decided based on climate of the region. 
6. Under abnormal weather conditions planners 
can adopt a short-term contingent planning. 
6. Helps in long-term agricultural planning. 
 
Factors affecting climate 
i) Latitude 
 
The distance from the equator, either south or north, largely creates variations in the 
climate. Based on the latitude, the climate has been classified as  
 
i) Tropical  
 
ii) Sub-tropical  
iii) Temperate      & 
iv)  Polar. 
ii) Altitude (elevation) 
 
The height from the MSL creates variation in climate. Even in the tropical regions, the 
high mountains have temperate climate. The temperature decreases by 6.5 ºC/Km from the sea 
level. Generally, there is also a decrease in pressure and increase in precipitation and wind 
velocity. The above factors alter the kind of vegetation, soil types and the crop production. 
iii) Precipitation 
 
The quantity and distribution of rainfall decides the nature of vegetation and the nature of 
the cultivated crops. The crop regions are classified on the basis of average rainfall which is as 
follow.

iv) Soil type 
 
Soil is a product of climatic action on rocks as modified by landscape and vegetation 
over a long period of time. The colour of the soil surface affects the absorption, storage and re-
radiation of heat. White colour reflects while black absorbs more radiation. Due to differential 
absorption of heat energy, variations in temperature are created at different places. In black soil 
areas, the climate is hot while in red soil areas, it is comparatively cooler due to lesser heat 
absorption. 
v) Nearness to large water bodies 
 
The presence of large water bodies like lakes and sea including its current affect the 
climate of the surrounding areas, eg:  Islands and coastal areas. The movement of air from 
earth’s surface and from water bodies to earth modifies the climate. The extreme variation in 
temperature during summer and winter is minimized in coastal areas and island. 
vi) Topography 
 
The surface of landscape (leveled or uneven surface areas) produces marked change in 
the climate. This involves the altitude of the place, steepness of the slope and exposure of the 
slope to light and wind. 
vii) Vegetation 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 106 of 200.

 
Kinds of vegetation characterize the nature of climate. Thick vegetation is found in 
tropical regions where temperature and precipitation are high. General types of vegetations 
present in a region indicate the nature of the climate of that region. 
Scales of climate and their importance 
i) Microclimate 
 
Microclimate deals with the climatic features peculiar to small areas and with the 
physical processes that take place in the layer of air very near to the ground. Soil-ground 
conditions, character of vegetation cover, aspect of slopes, and state of the soil surface, relief 
forms – all these may create special local conditions of temperature, humidity, wind and 
radiation in the layer of air near the ground which differ sharply from general climatic conditions. 
One of the most important tasks of agricultural meteorology is to study the properties of air near 
the ground and surface layer of soil, which falls under the micro climate. 
ii) Meso climate 
 
The scale of meso climate falls between micro and macro climates. It is concerned with 
the study of climate over relatively smaller areas between 10 & 100 km across. 
iii) Macro climate 
 
Macro climate deals with the study of atmosphere over large areas of the earth and with 
the large scale atmospheric motions that cause weather. The scales of air motion in different 
climates are given in the Table below.

CLIMATES OF INDIA AND TAMILNADU AND THEIR CHARACTERIZATION 
Climate classification was tried by many scientists from beginning of 19th century using many 
parameters. Thornthwaite during 1931 and 1948 classified the climate using precipitation and 
evaporation /Potential evaporation and was subsequently modified by Mathur (1955) for the 
Moisture Index (Im) and is give below 
Im = 100 [(P-PE)/PE] 
Where P = Precipitation, PE = Potential evapo-transpiration 
Using the moisture Index (Im) the following classification was made

The tropic of cancer, which passes through the middle of the country, divides it into two distinct 
climates. The tropical climate in the South where all the 12 months of the year have mean daily 
temperature exceeding 20°C; and in the North where a sub-tropical climate prevails. In sub-
tropics during the winter months, it is cool to cold. Frosts occur sometime during the months of 
December and January. Some areas in the Northern India have a temperate climate. Here it 
snows during the winter months and freezing temperatures may extend to two months or more 
during the year. Three main climatic zones of India based on temperature are shown in the map 
below.

WEATHER ELEMENTS AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON DIFFERENT CROPS 
 
The weather elements are solar radiation, temperature, soil temperature and 
light, radiation. 
Solar radiation – Spectrum of radiation – Characteristics of different wave lengths 
and their effect on crop production. 
Sun 
 Sun is the prime source of energy 
 Sun is the nearest star to the planet earth 
 Diameter of the sun is 1.39 X 106 km 
 It rotates on its axis about once every four weeks(27 days near equator & 30 
days –polar) 
 Sun is on an average 1.5 X 108 km away from the earth (149.64 M km deviation 
is 2.41 Mkm) 
 Surface temperature of the sun is 5462° K 
 Every minute, the sun radiates approximately 56 X 1026 calories of energy. 
 The interior mass of the sun has a density of 80 to 100 times that of water. 
 Energy is due to the fusion, Hydrogen is transformed to helium. 
 99% of the energy to biosphere is only from the sun and the rest one percent is 
from stars,lightning discharge, sun’s radiation reflected from the moon, re-
radiation from the earth etc.

Insolation 
Electro magnetic energy radiated into the space by the sun 
Factors affecting insolation 
1. The solar constant which depends on 
a. Energy output of the sun 
b. Distance from earth to sun 
2. Transparency of the atmosphere 
3. Duration of daily sunlight period 
4. Angle at which sun’s noon rays strike the earth. 
Transfer of heat 
 
All mater, at a temperature above the absolute zero, imparts energy to the 
surrounding space. Three processes viz. conduction, convection and radiation are 
involved in heat flow or heat transfer. 
Conduction 
 
Heat transfer through matter without the actual movement of the substances or 
matter. Heat flows from the warmer to cooler part of the body so that the temperatures 
between them are equalized. Eg. The energy transmission through an iron rod which is 
made warmer at one end. 
Convection 
 
Processes of transmission of heat through actual movement of molecules of the 
medium. This is predominant form of energy transmission on the earth as all the weather 
related processes involve this process. Eg. Boiling of water in a beaker 
Radiation. 
Transfer of energy from one body to another without the aid of the material medium 
(solid, liquid or gas). Radiation is not heat, only when radiation is absorbed by surface of

a body heat is produced. Eg. The energy transmission through space from the sun to the 
earth. 
Solar radiation 
 
The flux of radiant energy from the sun is solar radiation. 
Heavenly bodies emit – short wave radiation 
Near surfaces including earth emit - long wave radiation 
Radiation flux 
 
The amount of radiant energy emitted, received, transmitted across a particular 
area is known as radiant flux. 
Radiant flux density 
 
The radiant flux divided by the area across which the radiation is transmitted is 
called radiant flux density. 
Emissive power 
 
The radiant flux density emitted by a source is called its emissive power.

Solar radiation and crop plants 
Crop production is exploitation of solar radiation 
Three broad spectra 
1. Shorter than visible range: Chemically very active 
 When plants are exposed to this radiation the effects are detrimental. 
 Atmosphere acts as regulator for this radiation and none of cosmic, Gamma and 
Xrays 
reaches to the earth. 
 The UV rays of this segment reaching to the earth are very low and it is normally 
tolerated by the plants. 
2. Higher than visible wavelength 
 Referred to IR radiation 
 It has thermal effect on plants 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology

Page 114 of 200.

 In the presence of water vapour, this radiation does not harm plants, rather it 
supplies the necessary thermal energy to the plant environment. 
3. Visible spectrum 
 Between UV & IR radiation and also referred as light 
 All plant parts are directly or indirectly influenced by the light 
 Intensity, quality and duration are important for normal plant growth 
 Poor light leads to plant abnormalities 
 Light is indispensable to photosynthesis 
 Light affect the production of tillers, the stability, strength and length of 
            Culms 
 It affects the yield, total weight of plant structures, size of the leaves and 
root development.

Radiation balance – Solar constant – albedo – Sensible heat – Heat energy – 
Latent heat 
 
A part of the incident radiation on the surface is absorbed, while a part is 
reflected and the remaining is transmitted. 
Absorptivity 
 
Absorptivity of a substance is defined as the ratio of the amount of radiant energy 
absorbed to the total amount incident upon that substance. The absorptivity of a 
blackbody is unity. Natural bodies like sun and earth are near perfect black bodies 
Reflectivity 
 
Reflectivity is defined as the ratio of the radiant energy reflected to the total 
incident radiation upon that surface. If it is expressed in percentage it becomes albedo. 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 116 of 200.

Transmittivity 
 
Transmittivity is defined as ratio of the transmitted radiation to the total incident 
radiation 
upon the surface. 
Emissivity 
 
Emissivity is defined as the ratio of the radiant energy emitted by a given surface 
to the total heat energy emitted by a black body. The emissivity of a black body is unity. 
Blackbody radiation 
 
A Blackbody is defined as a body, which completely absorbs all the heat 
radiations falling on it without reflecting and transmitting any of it. It means reflectivity 
and transmittivity become zero. When such a black body is heated it emits radiation of 
all wavelengths depending upon its temp. 
Radiation balance 
 
The difference between all incoming and outgoing radiation at the earth’s surface 
and top of the atmosphere is known as radiation balance at the earth’s surface.

Solar constant 
 
Solar constant is the energy received on a unit area at the outer most boundary 
of the earth (atmosphere) surface held perpendicular to the sun’s direction, at the mean 
distance between the sun and the earth. 
 
Solar constant is not a true constant. It fluctuates by as much as ± 3.5 % about 
its mean 
value depending upon the distance of the earth from the sun. 
 
Value is 2 cal / cm2 / min. (1.92 and 2.02) Recent measurements indicate value 
of 1.94 
cal / cm2 / min (133 wm-2) [1 Langley = 1cal] 
 
35% of the energy is contributed by U.V. and visible parts and 65% by Infra Red. 
Albedo 
 
It is the percentage of reflected radiation to the incident radiation. (Varies with 
colour and composition of the earth’s surface, season, angle of the sun rays). Value is 
Highest in winter and at sunrise and sunset. Pure water – 5-20%, Vegetation 10-40%, 
Soils 15-50%, Earth 34-43% and clouds 55%. High albedo indicates that much of the 
incident solar radiation is reflected rather than absorbed. 
Depends up on 
1. Angle of incidence of radiation. Albedo increase with decreasing elevation of sun with 
minimum during noon. 
2. Physical characteristics of surface 
3. Season 
4. Time of the day 
For plant community albedo depends upon 
1. Age of the crop 
2. Percentage of ground cover

3. Colour and reflectivity of the foliage 
Outgoing long wave radiation 
After being heated by solar radiation, the earth becomes source of radiation. 
Average temperature of the earth’s surface 285º k (12º C) 
99% of radiation is emitted in the farm of IR range (4 to 120 μ) 
About 90% of the outgoing radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere. 
 
Water vapour absorb in wavelengths of 5.3 to 7.7 μ and beyond 20μ. 
 
Ozone 9.4 to 9.8 μ. 
 
CO2 – 13.1 to 16.9 μ 
 
Clouds – in all wavelengths 
 
Long wave radiation escapes to the space between 8.5 and 11 μ and this is 
known as the atmospheric window. Atmosphere for this spectrum acts as transparent 
medium instead of absorbing. This spectral region is used in microwave remote sensing 
to monitor the features of the sky in case of overcast sky. 
 
 A large part of the radiation absorbed by the atmosphere is sent back to the 
earth’s surface as counter – radiation. This counter radiation prevents the earth’s surface 
from excessive cooling at night. 
Radiation laws 
 
The direct transfer of heat from the sun to the earth through the space and 
atmosphere indicates that radiation of heat from one place to other occurs in the form of 
electromagnetic waves in the same manner and with same speed of as light. The 
wavelength of electromagnetic radiation is given by the equation 
 
C 
λ = 
 
V 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 119 of 200.

Where λ = Wavelength (The shortest distance between consecutive crests in the wave 
trance) 
C = Velocity of light (3x1010 cm sec-1) 
V = Frequency means number of vibrations of cycles per second 
Plank’s law 
 
Plank introduced the ‘particle concept’. The electromagnetic radiation consists of 
a stream or flow of particles or quanta, each quantum having energy content E 
determined by of each quantum is proportional to the frequency given by the equation. 
 
E= h v where 
 
h= Plank’s constant (6.62x10-34 J sec-1 
 
V= Frequency 
The law states that greater the frequency (shorter wave length) greater is the energy of 
quantum. 
Kirchoff’s law 
 
A good absorber of radiation is a good emitter, in similar circumstances. This law 
states that the absorptivity ‘a’ of an object for radiation of a specific wavelength is equal 
to the emissivity ‘e’ for the same wavelength. The equation of the law is : 
 
 
 
 
a (λ) = e (λ) 
Stefan-Boltzmann’s law 
 
The intensity of radiation emitted (E) by a radiating body is directly proportional to 
the fourth power of the absolute temperature of that body. (Emissivity of black body = 1) 
E = σ T4 
Where, 
 
T= (273+°C) because temperature is in Kelvins 
 
= Stefan-Boltzmann’s constant which is equal to 5.673 x 10-8 W m-2 K-4 
Wein’s Displacement laws 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 120 of 200.

 
The wavelength of the maximum intensity of emission (λmax) from a radiating 
black body is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature 
 
 
 
λmax = 2897 T-1 μ = 2897/T μ Where T is in ºK 
 
If the temperature of a body is high, radiation maximum is displaced towards 
shorter wavelengths. For the sun’s surface temperature of 5793°K, the λmax is 0.5μ 
(2897/5793). The most intense solar radiation occurs in the blue-green range of visible 
light. The wavelength of maximum intensity of radiation for the earth’s actual surface 
temperature of 14°C or 287°K is about 10.0 (2897/287) microns, which is in the infrared 
band. 
Energy balance or heat balance 
 
The net radiation is the difference between total incoming and outgoing 
radiations and is a measure of the energy available at the ground surface. It is the 
energy available at the earth’s surface to drive the processes of evaporation, air and soil 
heat fluxes as well as other smaller energy consuming processes such as 
photosynthesis and respiration. The net radiation over crop is as follows. 
 
 
Rn = G + H + LE + PS + M 
Rn is net radiation, G is surface soil heat flux, H is sensible heat flux, LE is laten heat 
flux, PS and M are energy fixed in plants by photosynthesis and energy involved in 
respiration, respectively. The PS and M are assumed negligible due to their minor 
contribution (about 1-2% of Rn). The net radiation is the basic source of energy for 
evapotranspiration (LE), heating the air (H) and soil (S) and other miscellaneous M 
including photosynthesis. 
Temperature 
 
It is defined as the measure of the average speed of atoms and molecules 
Kinetic energy 
 
Energy of motion. 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology

Page 121 of 200.

Heat 
 
It is the aggregate internal energy of motion and molecules of a body. It is often 
defined as energy in the process of being transferred from one object to another 
because of the temperature between them. 
Sensible heat 
 
It is the heat that can be measured by a thermometer and thus sensed by 
humans. Normally measured in Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin. 
Latent heat 
 
It is the energy required to change a substance to a higher state of matter. This 
same energy is released on the reverse process. Change of state through Evaporation 
and condensation is known as latent heat of evaporation and latent heat of 
condensation. From water to water vapour takes 600 calories and water to ice takes 80 
calories. 
Blue colour of the sky 
 
If the circumference of the scattering particle is less than about 1/10 of the 
wavelength of the incident radiation, the scattering co-efficient is inversely proportional to 
the fourth power of the wavelength of the incident radiation. This is known as Rayleigh 
scattering. This is the primary cause of the blue colour of the sky. For larger particles 
with circumference >30 times of wavelength of the incident radiation, scattering is 
independent of the wavelength (i.e) white light is scattered. This is known as Mei 
scaring 
Red Colour of the sky at sunset & sunrise. 
 
It is because of increased path length in the atmosphere. % of solar energy in the 
visible part decreases. With in the visible part, the ratio of the blue to the red part 
decreases with increased path length. 
Disposition of Solar radiation 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology

Page 122 of 200.

a. 25% of solar radiation is reflected back to the space by clouds (more by middle and 
high latitudes and less in the sub tropics) 
b. 6% reflected back by air, dust and water vapour. 
c. 30% scatted downwards (more in the form of shorter wavelengths able) them that in 
longer wave length (red). 
d. 17% of solar radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere. (Mostly by Oxygen, O3, CO2 & 
H2O 
vapour). 
 
O2 – absorb the extreme UV wavelengths (0.12 to 0.6 μ) 
 
O3 – UV (0.2 to 0.32 μ) and Visible part of radiation (0.44 to 0.7 μ) 
 
H2O vapour – Near infra red (0.93, 1.13, 1.42 μ) 
 
CO2 - IR band 2.7 μ. 
e. About 50% of solar radiation reaches earth’s surface, after reflection, scattering and 
absorption.

Light 
 
Light is the visible portion of the solar spectrum with wavelength range is from 
0.39 to 0.76μ. Light is one of the important climatic factors for many vital functions of the 
plant. It is essential for the synthesis of the most important pigment ie. Chlorophyll, 
Chlorophyll absorbs the radiant energy and converts it into potential energy of 
carbohydrate. The carbohydrate thus formed is the connecting link between solar energy 
and living world. In addition, it regulates the important physiological functions. The 
characteristics of light viz. intensity, quality, duration and direction are important for 
crops.

Light intensity 
 The intensity of light is measured by comparing with a standard candle. The 
amount of light received at a distance of one metre from a standard candle is 
known as “Metre candle or Lux”. The light intensity at one foot from a standard 
candle is called ‘foot candle’ or 10.764 luxes and the instrument used is called as 
lux metre. 
 About one percent of the light energy is converted into biochemical energy. 
 Very low light intensity reduces the rate of photosynthesis resulting in reduced 
growth. 
 Similarly, very high intensity is detrimental to plant in many ways as below. 
 It increases the rate of respiration. 
 It also causes rapid loss of water (ie) increases the transpiration rate of water 
from the plants. 
 The most harmful effect of high intensity light is that it oxidises the cell contents 
which is termed as ‘Solarisation’. This oxidation is different from respiration and 
is called as photo-oxidation. 
 Under field conditions the light is not spread evenly over the crop canopy but 
commonly passed by reflection and transmission through several layers of 
leaves. 
 The intensity of light falls at exponential rate with path length through absorbing 
layers according to Beer’s law. ie the relative radiation intensity decreases 
exponentially with increasing leaf area. 
 At ground level the light intensity is below the light compensation point (The light 
intensity at which the gas exchange resulting from photosynthesis is equal to that 
resulting from respiration) 
Based on the response to light intensities the plants are classified as follows. 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 124 of 200.

(i) Sciophytes (shade loving plants): The plants grow better under partially shaded 
conditions. (eg) Betel vine, buck wheat etc. 
(ii) Hetrophytes (Sun loving): Many species of plants produce maximum dry matter 
under high light intensities when the moisture is available at the optimum level. (eg) 
Maize, sorghum, rice etc. 
Quality of Light 
 
When a beam of white light is passed through a prism, it is dispersed into 
wavelengths of different colours. This is called the visible part of the solar spectrum. The 
different colours and their wave length are as follows: 
Violet 400 – 435 m μ   
 
 
Blue 435 – 490 m μ 
Green 490 – 574 m μ   
 
 
Yellow 574 – 595 m μ 
Orange 595 – 626 m μ  
 
 
Red 626 – 750 m μ 
 
The principal wavelength absorbed and used in photosynthesis are in the violet – 
blue and the orange - red regions. Among this, short rays beyond violet such as X rays, 
gamma rays and larger rays beyond red such as infrared, are detrimental to plant 
growth. Red light is the most favourable light for growth followed by violet – blue. Ultra – 
violet and shorter wave lengths kill bacteria and many fungi. 
c) Duration of light 
 
The duration of light has greater influence than the intensity for canopy 
development and final yield. It has a considerable importance in the selection of crop 
varieties. The response of plants to the relative length of the day and night is known as 
phtoperiodism. The plants are classified based on the extent of response to day length 
which is as follows. 
(i) Long day plants 
 
The plants which develop and produce normally when the photoperiod is greater 
than the critical minimum (greater than 12 hours). eg. Potato, Sugarbeet, Wheat, Barley 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 125 of 200.

etc. 
(ii) Short day plants 
 
The plants which develop normally when the photoperiod is less than the critical 
maximum (less than 12 hours). Rice, Sorghum, cotton, Sunflower 
(iii) Day neutral plants / Indeterminate 
 
Those plants which are not affected by photoperiod. 
(eg) Tomato, Maize 
 
The photoperiodism influences the plant character such as floral initiation or 
development, bulb and rhizome production etc. In long day plant, during periods of short 
days, the growth of internodes are shortened and flowering is delayed till the long days 
come in the season. Similarly when short day plants are subjected to long day periods, 
there will be abnormal vegetative growth and there may not be any floral initiation. 
Direction of light 
 The direction of sunlight has a greater effect on the orientation of roots and 
leaves. 
 In temperate regions, the southern slopes plants produce better growth than the 
northern slopes due to higher contribution of sunlight in the southern side. 
 The change of position or orientation of organs of plants caused by light is 
usually called as phototropism ie the leaves are oriented at right angles to 
incidence of light to receive  maximum light radiation. 
Photomorphogenesis 
 
Change in the morphology of plants due to light. This is mainly due to U.V and 
violet ray of the sun. 
AIR TEMPERATURE 
 
Temperature is defined as, “The measure of speed per molecule of all the 
molecules of a body”. Where as heat is, “the energy arising from random motion of all 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 126 of 200.

the molecules of a body’. (Degree of molecular activity). It is the intensity aspect of heat 
energy. 
Conduction 
 
Heat transfer when two bodies of unequal temperatures come into contact. Heat 
passes from point to point by means of adjacent molecules. 
Convection 
 
Transfer through movement of particles (part of mass) in fluids and gasses. 
These ar able to circulate internally and distribute heated part of the mass. 
Radiation 
 
It is the process of transmission of energy by electromagnetic waves between 
two bodies without the necessary aid of an intervening material medium. 
Factors affecting air temperature 
i. Latitude 
ii. Altitude 
iii. Distribution of land and water 
iv. Ocean currents 
v. Prevailing winds 
vi. Cloudiness 
vii. Mountain barriers 
viii. Nature of surface 
ix. Relief 
x. Convection and turbulence etc. 
1. Latitude 
 
The time of occurrence of maximum monthly mean temperature and minimum 
monthly mean temperature also depends on latitude of a place. (eg.) The coldest month 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 127 of 200.

is January in northern regions of India while December in the south. Similarly, the 
warmest month is May in the south while June in the north across the country. 
2. Altitude 
 
The surface air temperature decreases with increasing altitude from the mean 
sea level as the density of air decreases. Since the density of air is less at higher 
altitudes, the absorbing capacity of air is relatively less with reference to earth’s 
longwave radiation. 
3. Distribution of land and water 
 
Land and water surfaces react differently to the insolation. Because of the great 
contrasts between land and water surfaces their capacity for heating the atmosphere 
varies. Variations in air temperature are much greater over the land than over the water. 
The differential heating process between land and sea surfaces are due to their 
properties. It is one of the reasons for Indian monsoon. 
4. Ocean currents 
 
The energy received over the ocean surface carried away by the ocean currents 
from the warm areas to cool areas. This results in temperature contrast between the 
equator and poles. The occurrence of El-Nino is due to change in sea surface 
temperature between two oceanic regions over the globe. 
5. Prevailing winds 
 
Winds can moderate the surface temperature of the continents and oceans. In 
the absence of winds, we feel warm in hot climates. At the same time, the weather is 
pleasant if wind blows. 
6. Cloudiness 
 
The amount of cloudiness affects the temperature of the earth’s surface and the 
atmosphere. A thick cloud reduces the amount of insolation received at a particular 
place and thus the day time temperature is low. At the same time, the lower layers in the 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 128 of 200.

atmosphere absorb earth’s radiation. This results in increasing atmospheric temperature 
during night. That is why, cloudy nights are warmer. This is common in the humid 
tropical climates. 
7. Mountain barriers 
 
Air at the top of the mountain makes little contact with the ground and is therefore 
cold while in the valley at the foothills makes a great deal of contact and is therefore 
warm. That is, the lower region of the earth’s atmosphere is relatively warmer when 
compared to hillocks. 
Diurnal and seasonal variation of air temperature 
 The minimum air temperature occurs at about sunrise, after which there is a 
constant 
rise till it reaches to maximum. 
 The maximum air temperature is recorded between 1300 hrs and 1400 hrs 
although the 
maximum solar radiation is reaches at the moon. 
 A steady fall in temperature till sunrise is noticed after is attains maximum. Thus 
the daily March displays one maximum and one minimum. The difference 
between the two is called the diurnal range of air temperature. 
 The diurnal range of air temperature is more on clear days while cloudy weather 
sharply reduces daily amplitudes. 
 The diurnal range of temperature is also influenced by soils and their coverage in 
addition to seasons. 
 Addition of daily maximum and minimum temperature divided by two is nothing 
but daily mean / average temperature. 
 In northern hemisphere winter minimum occurs in January and summer 
maximum in July. 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology

Horizontal air temperature distribution 
 The lines connecting points of equal temperature is called as isotherm 
 It is largely depends latitude. A general decrease in temperature from equator 
towards poles is one of the most fundamental factors of climatology. 
 Irregular distribution of land and water on earth’s surface breaks the latitudinal 
variation in temperature. 
 Land areas warm and cool rapidly than water bodies 
 Mountain barriers influence horizontal distribution of temperature by restricting 
movement of air masses. 
 On local scale topographic relief exerts an influence on temperature distribution. 
Vertical air temperature distribution 
Decrease in temperature with increase in height 
Temperature inversion 
 Occasionally at some altitude the temperature abruptly increases instead of 
decreasing. This condition in which this abrupt rise instead of fall in temperature 
occurs in the air is known as the temperature inversion. This may occurs under 
the following conditions. 
 When the air near the ground cools off faster than the overlying layer, because of 
heat loss during cooling nights. 
 When an actual warm layer passing over a lower cold layer 
 Cold air from hill tops and slopes tend to flow downward and replaced by warm 
air. 
Significance of Temperature inversion 
 Cloud formation, precipitation and atmospheric visibility are greatly influenced by 
inversion phenomenon 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 130 of 200.

 Fog formation may take place near the ground which may affect the visibility to 
both human beings and animals. Affects air navigation. 
 Diurnal temperature is affected by temperature inversions. 
 The incoming solar radiation and its conversion in to heat is affected. 
Heat Units 
 It is a measure of relative warmth of growing season of a given length. Normally 
it is indicated as Growing Degree Days (GDD). A heat unit is the departure from 
the mean daily temperature above the minimum threshold temperature. 
 The minimum threshold temperature is the temperature below which no growth 
takes place. 
 Usually ranges from 4.5 to 12.5 ºC for different crops (Most commonly used 
value is 6.0ºC) 
Degree Day 
 
A degree day is obtained by subtracting the threshold temperature from daily 
mean temperature. Summation of the daily values over the growth period gives degree 
days of the crops.

HEAR INJURIES 
 
‘Thermal death point” – the temperature at which the plant cell gets killed when 
the temperature ranges from 50-60°C. This varies with plant species. The aquatic and 
shade loving plants are killed at comparatively lower temperature (40°C). 
High temperature 
- results in desiccation of plants 
- disturbs the physiological activities like photosynthesis and respiration 
- increases respiration leading to rapid depletion of reserve food. 
Sun clad 
 
Injury caused on the barks of stem by high temperature during day time and low 
temperature during the night time. 
Stem griddle 
 
The stem at ground level scorches around due to high soil temperature. It causes 
death of plant by destroying conductive tissues. Eg. This type of injury is very common in 
young seedlings of cotton in sandy soil when soil temperature exceeds 60°C. 
COLD INJURY 
(i) Chilling injury 
 
Plants which are adapted to hot climate, if exposed to low temperature for 
sometime, are found to be killed or severely injured or development of chloratic condition 
(yellowing) (eg.) cholratic bands on the leaves of sugarcane, sorghum and maize in 
winter months when the night temperature is below 20°C. 
(ii) Freezing injury 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 132 of 200.

 
This type of injury is commonly observed in plants of temperate regions. When 
the plants are exposed to very low temperature, water freezes into ice crystals in the 
intercellular spaces of plants. The protoplasm of cell is dehydrated resulting in the death 
of cells. (eg.) Frost damage in potato, tea etc. 
(iii) Suffocation 
 
In temperature regions, usually during the winter season, the ice or snow forms a 
thick cover on the soil surface. As a result, the entry of oxygen is prevented and crop 
suffers for want of oxygen. Ice coming in contact with the root prevents the diffusion of 
CO2 outside the root zone. This prevents the respiratory activities of roots leading to 
accumulation of harmful substances. 
(iv) Heaving 
 
This is a kind of injury caused by lifting up of the plants along with soil from its 
normal position. This type of injury is commonly seen in temperate regions. The 
presence of ice crystals increases the volume of soil. This causes mechanical lifting of 
the soil. 
Role of temperature in crop production: 
1. Temperature influences distribution of crop plants and vegetation. 
2. The surface air temperature is one of the important variables, which influences all 
stages of crop during its growth development and reproductive phase. 
3. Air temperature affects leaf production, expansion and flowering. 
4. The diffusion rates of gases and liquid changes with temperature. 
5. Solubility of different substances is dependent on temperature. 
6. Biochemical reactions in crops (double or more with each 10°C rise) are influenced by 
air temperature. 
7. Equilibrium of various systems and compounds is a function of temperature. 
8. Temperature affects the stability of enzymatic systems in the plants. 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology

9. Most of the higher plants grow between 0°C – 60°C and crop plants are further 
restricted from 10 – 40°C, however, maximum dry matter is produced between 20 and 
30°C 
10. At high temperature and high humidity, most of the crop plants are affected by pests 
and diseases. 
11. High night temperature increases respiration and metabolism. 
12. A short duration crop becomes medium duration or long duration crop depending 
upon its environmental temperature under which it is grown. 
13. Most of the crops have upper and lower limits of temperature below or above which, 
they may not come up and an optimum temperature when the crop growth is maximum. 
These are known as cardinal temperatures and different crops have different 
temperatures.

Thermo periodic response 
 
Response of living organism to regular changes in temperature either day or 
night or seasonal is called thermoperiodism. 
Soil temperature 
 
The soil temperature is one of the most important factors that influence the crop 
growth. The sown seeds, plant roots and micro organisms live in the soil. The physio-
chemical as well as life processes are directly affected by the temperature of the soil. 
Under the low soil temperature conditions signification is inhibited and the intake of 
water by roof is reduced. In a similar way extreme soil temperatures injures plant and its 
growth is effected. 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 134 of 200.

Eg. On the sunny side, plants are likely to develop faster near a wall that stores and 
radiates heat. If shaded by the wall, however, the same variety may mature later. In such 
cases soil temperature is an important factor. 
Importance of soil temperature on crop plants: 
The soil temperature influences many process. 
1. Governs uptake of water, nutrients etc needed for photosynthesis. 
2. Controls soil microbial activities and the optimum range is 18-30°C. 
3. Influences the germination of seeds and development of roots. 
4. Plays a vital role in mineralization of organic forms of nitrogen.(inc with inc in temp) 
5. Influences the presence of organic matter in the soil.(more under low soil 
temperature) 
6. Affects the speed of reactions and consequently weathering of minerals. 
7. Influences the soil structure (types of clay formed, the exchangeable ions present, 
etc.) 
Factors affecting soil temperature: 
Heat at ground surface is propagated downward in the form of waves. The amplitude 
deceases with depth. Both meteorological and soil factors contribute in bringing about 
changes of soil temperature. 
I) Meteorological factors 
1. Solar radiation 
a) The amount of solar radiation available at any given location and point of time is 
directly proportional to soil temperature. 
b) Even though a part of total net radiation available is utilised in evapotranspiration 
and heating the air by radiation (latent and sensible heat fluxes) a relatively substantial 
amount of solar radiation is utilized in heating up of soil (ground heat flux) depending up 
on the nature of 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 135 of 200.

surface. 
c) Radiation from the sky contributes a large amount of heat to the soil in areas where 
the sun’s rays have to penetrate the earth’s atmosphere very obliquely. 
2. Wind 
Air convection or wind is necessary to heat up the soil by conduction from the 
atmosphere. 
(eg.) The mountain and valley winds influence the soil temperature. 
3. Evaporation and condensation 
a) The greater the rate of evaporation the more the soil is cooled. This is the reason for 
coolness of moist soil in windy conditions. 
b) On the other hand whenever water vapour from the atmosphere or from other soil 
depths condenses in the soil it heats up noticeably. Freezing of water generates heat. 
4. Rainfall (Precipitation) 
Depending on its temperature, precipitation can either cool or warm the soil. 
II. Soil factors 
1. Aspect and slope 
a) In the middle and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere, the southern slopes 
receive more insolation per unit area than the northern exposure. 
b) The south west slopes, are usually warmer than the south east slopes. The reason is 
that the direct beam of sunshine on the south east slope occur shortly after prolonged 
cooling at night, but the evaporation of dew in the morning also requires energy. 
2. Soil texture 
a) Because of lower heat capacity and poor thermal conductivity, sandy soils warm up 
more rapidly than clay soils. The energy received by it is concentrated mainly in a thin 
layer resulting in extraordinary rise in temperature. 
b) Radiational cooling at night is greater in light soils than in heavy soils. In the top layer, 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 136 of 200.

sand has the greatest temperature range, followed by loam and clay. 
c) The decrease of range with depth is more rapid in light soils than heavy soils when 
they are dry but slower when they are wet. 
d) A soil with rough surface absorbs more solar radiation than one with a smooth 
surface. 
3. Tillage and Tilth 
a) By loosening the top soil and creating a mulch, tillage reduces the heat flow between 
the surface and the sub soil. 
b) Since, the soil mulch has a greater exposure surface than the undisturbed soil and no 
capillary connection with moist layers below, the cultivated soil dries up quickly by 
evaporation, but the moisture in the sub-soil underneath the dry mulch is conserved. 
c) In general soil warms up faster than air. The diurnal temperature wave of the 
cultivated soil has a much larger amplitude than that of the uncultivated soil. 
d) The air 2-3 cm above the tilled soil is often hotter (10°C or above) than that over an 
untilled soil. 
e) At night loosened ground is colder and more liable to frost than the uncultivated soil. 
4. Organic matter: 
a) The addition of organic matter to a soil reduces the heat capacity and thermal 
conductivity. But, the water holding capacity increases. 
b) The absorbtivity of the soil increases because of the dark colour of the organic matter. 
c) At night, the rapid flow of heat from sub-soil by radiation is reduced with the addition 
of organic matter because of its low thermal conductivity. 
d) The darker the colour, the smaller the fraction of reflected radiation. 
e) The dark soils and moist soils reflect less than the light coloured and dry soils. 
5. Soil moisture 
a) Moisture has an effect on heat capacity and heat conductivity. 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 137 of 200.

b) Moisture at the soil surface cools the soil through evaporation. 
c) Therefore, a moist soil will not heat up as much as a dry one. 
d) Moist soil is more uniform in temperature throughout its depth as it is a better 
conductor of heat than the dry soil. 
Variations in soil temperature: 
 
There are two types of soil temperature variations; daily and seasonal variation of 
soil temperature 
1. Daily variations of soil temperature: 
a) These variations occur at the surface of the soil. 
b) At 5 cm depth the change exceeds 10°C. At 20 cm the change is less and at 80 cm 
diurnal changes are practically nil. 
c) On cooler days the changes are smaller due to increased heat capacity as the soils 
become wetter on these days. 
d) On a clear sunny day a bare soil surface is hotter than the air temperature. 
e) The time of the peak temperature of the soil reaches earlier than the air temperature 
due to the lag of the air temperature. 
f) At around 20 cm in the soil the temperature in the ground reaches peak after the 
surface reaches its maximum due to more time the heat takes to penetrate the soil. The 
rate of penetration of heat wave within the soil takes around 3 hours to reach 10 cm 
depth. 
g) The cooling period of the daily cycle of the soil surface temperature is almost double 
than the warming period. 
h) Undesirable daily temperature variations can be minimised by scheduling irrigation. 
2. Seasonal variations of soil temperature: 
a) Seasonal variations occur much deeper into the soil. 
b) When the plant canopy is fully developed the seasonal variations are smaller. 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 138 of 200.

c) In winter, the depth to which the soil freezes depends on the duration and severeness 
of the winter. 
d) In summer the soil temperature variations are much more than winter in tropics and 
sub tropics. 
HUMIDITY –ABSOLUTE HUMIDITY – SPECIFIC HUMIDITY –RELATIVE HUMIDITY – 
MIXING RATIO, DEW POINT TEMPERATURE – VAPOUR PRESSURE DEFICIT –
DIURNAL VARIATION IN RELATIVE HUMIDITY AND ITS EFFECT ON CROP 
PRODUCTION. 
 
Humidity 
The amount of water vapour that is present in atmosphere is known as 
atmospheric moisture or humidity. 
Absolute humidity 
The actual mass of water vapour present in a given volume of moist air. It is 
expressed as grams of water vapour per cubic meter or cubic feet. 
Specific humidity 
Weight of water vapour per unit weight of moist air. It is expressed as grams of 
water vapour per kilogram of air (g/kg). 
Mixing ratio 
The ratio of the mass of water vapour contained in a sample of moist air to the 
mass of dry air. It is expressed as gram of water vapour per kilogram dry air. 
Relative Humidity 
The ratio between the amount of water vapour present in a given volume of air 
and the amount of water vapour required for saturation under fixed temperature and 
pressure. There are no units and this is expressed as percentage. In other terms it is the 
ratio of the air’s water vapour content to its maximum water vapour capacity at a given 
temperature expressed in percentage. The relative humidity gives only the degree of 
saturation of air. The relative humidity of saturated air is 100 per cent. 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 139 of 200.

Dew Point temperature 
The temperature to which a given parcel of air must be cooled in order to 
become saturation at constant pressure and water vapour content. In this case, the 
invisible water vapour begins to condense into visible form like water droplets. 
Vapour Pressure deficit 
The difference between the saturated vapour pressure (SVP) and actual vapour 
pressure (AVP) at a given temperature. This is an another measure of moisture in the 
atmosphere which is useful in crop growth studies. When air contains all the moisture 
that it can hold to its maximum limit, it is called as saturated air, otherwise it is 
unsaturated air, at that temperature. The vapour pressure created at this temperature 
under saturated conditions is vapour pressure or saturated vapour pressure (SVP). 
Importance of Humidity on crop plants 
The humidity is not an independent factor. It is closely related to rainfall, wind 
and temperature. It plays a significant role in crop production. 
1. The humidity determines the crops grown in a given region. 
2. It affects the internal water potential of plants. 
3. It influences certain physiological phenomena in crop plants including transpiration 
4. The humidity is a major determinant of potential evapotranspiration. So, it determines 
the water requirement of crops. 
5. High humidity reduces irrigation water requirement of crops as the evapotranspiration 
losses from crops depends on atmospheric humidity. 
6. High humidity can prolong the survival of crops under moisture stress. However, very 
high or very low relative humidity is not conducive to higher yields of crops. 
7. There are harmful effects of high humidity. It enhances the growth of some 
saprophytic and parasitic fungi, bacteria and pests, the growth of which causes 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 140 of 200.

extensive damage to crop plants. Eg: a. Blight disease on potato. b. The damage 
caused by thrips and jassids on several crops. 
8. High humidity at grain filling reduces the crop yields. 
9. A very high relative humidity is beneficial to maize, sorghum, sugarcane etc, while it is 
harmful to crops like sunflower and tobacco. 
10. For almost all the crops, it is always safe to have a moderate relative humidity of 
above 40%. 
Variation in Humidity: 
1. Absolute humidity is highest at the equator and minimum at the poles. 
2. Absolute humidity is minimum at sunrise and maximum in afternoon from 2 to 3 p.m. 
The diurnal variations are small in desert regions. 
3. The relative humidity is maximum at about the sunrise and minimum between 2 to 3 
p.m. 
4. The behaviour of relative humidity differs a lot from absolute humidity. At the equator it 
is at a maximum of 80 per cent and around 85 per cent at the poles. But, near horse 
latitudes it is around 70 per cent.

MONSOON 
Atmospheric pressure 
 
The atmospheric pressure is the weight of the air, which lies vertically above a unit area 
centered at a point. The weight of the air presses down the earth with the pressure of 1.034 gm 
/ cm2. It is expressed in millibar (mb) equal to 100 N/m2 or 1000 dynes/cm2. Unequal heating of 
the earth and its atmosphere by the sun and rotation of the earth bring about differences in 
atmospheric pressure. 
Isobars 
 
The distribution of pressure is represented on maps by ‘isobars’. Isobars are defined as 
the imaginary lines drawn on a map to join places having the same atmospheric pressure. 
Diurnal and seasonal variation 
(a) Diurnal pressure variation 
a. There is a definite rhythm in the rise and fall of the pressure in a day. 
b. Radiational heating (air expansion) and radiational cooling (air contraction) are the main 
reasons for diurnal variation in the air pressure. 
c. Diurnal variation is more prominent near the equator than at the mid latitudes. 
d. The areas closer to sea level record relatively larger amount of variation than in land areas. 
e. Equatorial regions absorbs more heat than it loses while the polar region gives up more heat 
than they receive 
b) Seasonal pressure variation 
a. Due to the effect caused by annual variation in the amount of insolation, distinct seasonal 
pressure variations occur. 
b. These variations are larger in the tropical region than the mid latitude and polar regions. 
c. Usually, high pressures are recorded over the continents during the cold season and over the 
oceans during the warm season.

The shape of the earth is not uniform and subjected to uneven distribution of solar 
radiation, when it revolves around the sun. The uneven distribution of solar radiation over 
different regions of the globe leads to contrast in surface air temperature. This results in 
variations of surface atmospheric pressure systems, which are known as standard atmospheric 
pressure systems / belts. There are altogether seven alternating low and high pressure belts on 
the earth’s surface. They are as follows: 
i. Equatorial trough of low pressure (between 5°N and 5°S) 
ii. Subtropical high pressure belt (Northern hemisphere) (25° and 35°N) 
iii. Subtropical high pressure belt (Southern hemisphere) (25° and 35°S) 
iv. Subpolar low pressure belt (Northern hemisphere) (60° and 70°N) 
v. Subpolar low pressure belt (Southern hemisphere) (60° and 70°S) 
vi. Polar high (Northern hemisphere) 
vii. Polar high (Southern hemisphere) 
 
The equatorial region receives more solar radiation and thus the surface air temperature 
is high, which creates lighter air near the ground compared to higher latitudes. The above 
condition leads to low atmospheric pressure over the equatorial region while sub tropical high 
pressure belts develop in both the hemispheres between 25 and 35 degree latitudes due to 
relatively low surface air temperature. It is due to low solar radiation received due to inclined 
sun’s rays over the subtropical region when compared to the equatorial belt. Like wise alternate 
low and high atmospheric pressure belt systems are developed across the globe from the 
equator to the poles.

Causes of variation 
 
The atmospheric pressure changes continuously due to several factors. The most 
important factors are changes with temperature, altitude, water vapour content and rotation of 
earth. 
a) Temperature 
 
Hot air expands and exerts low pressure. Cold air contracts and exerts high pressure. 
So the equator has a low pressure due to prevalence of high temperature but poles have a high 
pressure. 
b) Altitude 
 
At sea level, the air column exerts its full pressure, but when we stand on a hill or when 
we go in the upper layers of atmosphere, we leave a portion of air which cannot exert its full 
pressure. At sea level, a coastal town enjoys high pressure but on high altitude one will register 
a low pressure. For every 10 m of ascend, the pressure get reduced by 1 hPa. 
c) Water vapour 
 
The water vapour content is lighter in cold area than in air which is dry with the result 
that moist air of a high temperature exerts a less pressure when compared to cold air.

d) Rotation of the earth 
 
On account of rotation of the earth, the pressure at 60-70°N and S becomes low. The 
rotation of the earth near sub-polar belts, makes the air to escape from these belts which move 
towards the horse latitude (30° - 35°N and 30 – 35°S). These latitudes absorb the air from sub 
polar belts making the pressure high. G.D.Coriolis (1844) a French Mathematician indicated that 
air is deflected towards right in the Northern Hemisphere and Left in the Southern hemisphere 
due to rotation of earth and this was termed after him as Coriolis force. Coriolis force is not 
actually a force but it is effect created by rotation of earth. 
Low / Depression 
 
When the isobars are circular or elliptical in shape, and the pressure is lowest at the 
centre, such a pressure system is called ‘Low’ or ‘Depression’ or ‘Cyclone’. The movement will 
be anti-clockwise in the Northern hemisphere while it is clockwise in the southern hemisphere. 
Wind spped hardly exceeds 40 km per hour. 
Anticyclone 
 
When isobars are circular, elliptical in shape and the pressure is highest at the 
centresuch a pressure system is called ‘High’ or ‘Anticyclone’. When the isobars are elliptical 
rather than circular the system is called as ‘Ridge’ or ‘Wedge’. The movement will be clockwise 
in the Northern hemisphere while it is anti-clockwise in the southern hemisphere. 
Storm 
 
Low pressure centre surrounded by winds having their velocities in the range of 40 to 
120 km/hour. A more favourable atmosphere condition for their occurrence exists during the 
summer season. The Bay of Bengal and Arabian sea offer ideal condition for origin and growth 
of the storms. These storms produce heavy precipitation and bring about a change in the 
existing weather. It occurs very rarely. It causes wide spread damage. 
Hurricane 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology

Page 145 of 200.

 
 A severe tropical cyclone with wind speed exceeding 120 km per hour. The name 
hurricane is given to the tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic and the eastern North Pacific 
Ocean. The tropical cyclones of Hurricane force in the western North pacific are known as 
typhoons. In Australia this type of storm is given the name willy-willy, whereas in the Indian 
Ocean they are called as Cyclones. Hurricanes are fueled by water vapour (i.e.) pushed up from 
the warm ocean surface, so they can last longer and sometimes move much further over water 
than over land. A combination of heat and moisture along with the right wind conditions can 
create a new hurricane. 
Thunderstorms 
 
Storms produced by cumulonimbus clouds and always accompanied by lightening and 
thunder. They are usually of short duration, seldom over 2 hours. They are also accompanied 
by strong wind gusts, heavy rain and sometimes hail. 
Tornadoes 
 
Defined as a violently rotating column of air attended by a funnel-shaped or tubular cloud 
extending downward from the base of cumulonimbus cloud. Tornadoes are the most violent 
storms of lower troposphere. They are very small in size and of short duration. They mostly 
occur during spring and early summer. They have been reported at widely scattered locations in 
the mid latitudes and tropics. Crop losses are heavy due to this event. Unknown in other parts of 
the world. 
Waterspouts 
 
It is column of violently rotating air over water having a similarity to a dust devil of 
tornado. In other words, tornadoes are weak visible vortices occurring over water are called 
waterspouts. They are formed over tropical and subtropical oceans. 
Wind 
 
Air in horizontal motion is known as wind. Vertical movement is noticed but negligibly 
small compared to horizontal movement as the height of the atmosphere is only for few

kilometers. However vertical movement or uplift of air only causes significant weather changes 
in cloud formation and rain. 
Wind systems of the world 
The wind belts found on earth’s surface in each hemisphere are: 
a. Doldrums 
b. Trade wind belt 
c. Prevailing westerlies 
d. Polar easterlies 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Doldrums 
 
Owing to continuous heating of the earth by insolation, pressures are low and winds 
converge and rise near the equator. This intertropical convergent zone is known as ‘Doldrums’. 
a) These are the equatorial belts of calms and variable winds. 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 147 of 200.

b) The location is 5°S and 5°N latitudes. 
c) Wind is light due to negligible pressure gradient. 
d) Mostly, there are vertical movements in the atmosphere. 
e) The atmosphere is hot and sticky. 
2. Trade winds (Tropical Easterlies) 
a) The regular high temperature at the equator results in a high pressure forming in the upper 
levels of the equator. 
b) Then, the air is transferred to the northward and southward directions until 35° North and 
South in both the hemisphere. 
c) Due to this reduction in surface pressure on the equator (doldrums) there is an increase in 
pressure at 35°N and 35°S which are known as horse latitude (sub-tropical high). 
d) As a result, the winds flow from the horse latitude to the equatorial region. 
e) While moving, these winds are deflected by Coriolis force to the right in northern hemisphere 
and to the left in southern hemisphere. 
f) These winds flow from 35°N to the equator in NE direction in the northern hemisphere and 
from 35°S to the equator in SE direction in the southern hemisphere. These are known as 
‘Trade winds’. These are known as ‘Tropical easterlies’. 
g) These are most constant winds in force and direction and flow over nearly half the globe. 
3. Anti-trade winds 
a) This is a supplementary wind system of the earth which is effective at higher levels. 
b) This system works in opposite direction to the surface winds. 
c) The anti-trade winds mostly flow from land to ocean and brings no rain. 
4. Prevailing Westerlies 
a) The winds that flow from sub-tropical high to the low-pressure area about 60-70° latitudes in 
both the hemispheres are known as ‘Prevailing westerlies’. 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 148 of 200.

b) In the northern hemisphere the direction of Prevailing westerlies is SW and in southern 
hemisphere NW. 
c) These winds are forceful and are irregular as compare to the trade winds in the tropical 
regions. 
d) High precipitation zone 
5. Polar Easterlies / Polar winds 
b) A permanent high pressure exists on the poles. 
c) From these high pressure polar regions, cold winds flow to areas at about 60-65° latitudes in 
both the hemispheres. 
d) The winds flow in NE direction in the northern hemisphere and in SE direction in the southern 
hemisphere. 
Mountain winds 
a) Blows from mountain up slope to base 
b) Occurs during night time 
c) Cooling of air close to slope takes place 
d) Adiabatic heating decreases this phenomenon 
e) Also known as ‘Katabalic winds’ 
Valley winds 
a) Blow from valley base to up slope. 
b) Occurs during day time 
c) Over heating of air adjacent to slope takes place 
d) Adiabatic cooling decreases this phenomenon 
e) Also known as ‘Anabatic winds’ 
Sea breeze 
 
During the daytime, more so in summer, land is heated more than the adjacent body of 
water. As a result warmed air over the land expands producing an area of low pressure. The

isobaric surfaces bend upward as a result of which the cooler air starts moving across the coast 
line from sea to land. This is the ‘Sea breeze; or ‘On shore breeze’. 
Land breeze 
 
At night because of nocturnal radiation land is colder than adjacent sea and the pressure 
gradient is directed from land to sea. There is a gentle flow of wind from land to sea. This ‘off-
share’ wind is called ‘Land breeze’.

Effect of wind on crop plants 
1) Transports heat in either sensible or latent heat form from lower to higher altitudes 
2) Wind affects the plant directly by increasing transpiration and the intake of CO2 and also 
causes several types of mechanical damage. 
3) Wind helps in pollination and dispersal of seeds. 
4) Light and gentle winds are helpful for cleaning the agricultural produce. 
5) Hot dry winds frequently do much damage to vegetation in the growing crops by promoting 
excessive water loss. 
6) Wind has powerful effect on humidity. 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology

7) Long, continued warm, dry winds injured blossoms by evaporating the secretion of the 
stigma. 
8) Provides moisture which is necessary for precipitation 
9) Wind prevents frost by disrupting atmospheric inversion 
10) Causes soil erosion 
Wind speed in different season 
 
Winds represent air in motion. The primary cause of all winds is regional differences in 
temperature, producing regional differences in pressure. When these pressure differences 
persist for several hours, the rotation of the earth modifies the direction of motion, till the winds 
blow along lines of equal pressure. Wind direction and speed are modified frequently due to 
seasonal variation in solar radiation and differential heating of the earth’s surface. 
Wind Speed 
 
The winds are generally measured over level, open terrain at 3 meters above ground. 
Yet, a general idea of the distribution of the mean daily wind speed, on an annual basis as well 
as on a monthly basis, would be useful. The mean daily wind speed is the value obtained by 
averaging the wind speed (irrespective of direction) for a whole day. This averaged for all the 
days of a month is the mean daily wind speed for that month. The daily values averaged for all 
the 365 days of the year is the annual mean daily wind speed. 
Wind Direction 
 
Winds are always named after the direction they come from. Thus, a wind from the 
south, blowing towards north is called south wind. The wind vane is an instrument used to find 
out the direction of the wind. Windward refers to the direction wind comes from, and leeward 
refers to the direction it blows to. When a wind blows more frequently from one direction than 
from any other, it is called a prevailing wind. 
South West Monsoon wind direction 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 151 of 200.

 
During South West Monsoon period of June to September, the westerly winds prevail on 
the west of Kerala and south winds on the west of northern Circars, Orissa and Bengal. During 
April and May the region of high temperature is shifted to north viz., upper Sind, lower Punjab 
and Western Rajasthan. This area becomes the minimum barometric pressure area to which 
monsoon winds are directed. 
North East Monsoon wind direction 
 
During North East Monsoon period of October to December, on account of the increase 
in barometric pressure in Northern India, there is a shift in the barometric pressure to the South 
East and North Easterly winds begin to flow on the eastern coast, by the end of September. 
These changes bring on heavy and continue rainfall to the Southern and South Eastern India. 
Winter Rainfall 
 
It is restricted more to Northern India and is received in the form of snow on the hills and 
as rains in the plains of Punjab, Rajasthan and central India. Western disturbance is a dominant 
factor for rainfall during these months in northwestern India. 
Summer Rainfall 
 
The summer Rainfall is received from March to May as local storms. It is mostly received 
in the South East of Peninsular and in Bengal. Western India does not generally receive these 
rains.

CLOUDS 
CLOUDS 
 
“An aggregation of minute drops of water suspended in the air at higher altitudes” is 
called as cloud. A cloud is a visible aggregate of tiny water droplets and/or ice crystals 
suspended in the atmosphere and can exist in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some clouds are 
accompanied by precipitation; rain, snow, hail, sleet, even freezing rain. Clouds can occur at 
any level of the atmosphere wherever there is sufficient moisture to allow condensation to take 
place. The layer of the atmosphere where almost all cloud exists is the troposphere, although 
the tops of some severe thunderstorms occasionally pierce the tropopause.  
 
A cloud can be defined as hydrometeor consisting of minute particles of liquid water or 
ice, or of both, suspended in the free air and usually not touching the ground. It may also 
include larger particles of liquid water or ice as well as non-aqueous or solid particles such as 
those present in fumes, smoke or dust. 
DEVELOPMENT OF CLOUDS 
 
Water is known to exist in three different states; as a solid, liquid or gas.  
 
 
 
 
 
Clouds, snow, and rain are all made of up of some form of water. A cloud is comprised 
of tiny water droplets and/or ice crystals, a snowflake is an aggregate of many ice crystals, and 
rain is just liquid water.

Water existing as a gas is called water vapor. When referring to the amount of moisture 
in the air, we are actually referring to the amount of water vapor. If the air is described as 
"moist", that means the air contains large amounts of water vapor. Moisture is a necessary 
ingredient for the production of clouds and precipitation 
 
All clouds are a form of water. Clouds are condensed atmospheric moisture in the form 
of minute water droplets or ice crystals. The creation of a cloud begins at ground level. The sun 
heats the earth's surface, the warm ground heats the air, which rises. The air contains variable 
amounts of water, as vapor, that has evaporated from bodies of water and plants. Air at ground 
level is denser than air higher up, and as the warm air rises, it expands and becomes less 
dense. 
Air rises for three main reasons 
• 
Sunshine – heat from the sun or warm ground warms the air and makes it lighter. It 
therefore rises into the sky.  
• 
The terrain – air may rise as it is forced upwards due to changes in the terrain 
(landscape). This often occurs when wind blows air either over mountains, or over cliffs 
onto land from the sea.  
• 
A front – air can also rise at a weather front. At cold fronts, cold air is pushed under 
warm air, forcing it upwards and at a warm front, warm moist air is forced up and over 
the cold air. 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 154 of 200.

 Expansion cools the air and as the air cools, the water vapor that is present in the air, 
condenses into tiny microscopic droplets. Cloud formation depends on how much water is in the 
atmosphere, the temperature, the air current, and topography. If there is no water, no clouds 
can form. If condensation occurs below the freezing point, the cloud is made of ice crystals. 
Warm and cold air fronts, as well as topography can control how air rises. Clouds that form 
during vigorous uplift of air have a tall, stacked appearance and clouds formed by gentle uplift of 
air currents have a flat or stratified appearance. One can make short-term forecasts by 
observing clouds, as any change in the way a cloud looks indicates a change in the weather. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After cloud droplets (or ice crystals) form, then what happens to them? One of two things. Either 
they collide with each other and grow by joining together to such a large size that they fall to the 
ground as rain or snow, or they evaporate and change back into water vapor. It is estimated 
that, on average, about one-half of all cloud material eventually falls to the Earth as 
precipitation, while the other half re-evaporates back into water vapor. 
DROP SIZE AND CLOUD APPEARANCE  
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 155 of 200.

 
The smaller the drops in a cloud the brighter the tops appear (and the darker the bases). 
Smaller droplets scatter more sunlight, while large drops allow more sunlight to pass through. 
This explains why the heavily raining part of a shower cloud or thunderstorm is usually brighter 
than just the cloudy part. The cloud droplets have combined into large raindrops, which allow 
more sunlight to pass through them. 
CLOUD CLASSIFICATION 
  
A) A scheme of distinguishing and grouping clouds according to their 
appearance, and, where possible, to their process of formation.  
 
The one in general use, based on a classification system introduced by Luke Howard in 
1803, is that adopted by the World Meteorological Organization and published in the 
International Cloud Atlas (1956). This classification is based on the determination:  
 
1) genera - the main characteristic forms of clouds 
  
2) species - the peculiarities in shape and differences in internal structure of clouds 
 
3) varieties - special characteristics of arrangement and transparency of clouds 
 
4) supplementary features and accessory clouds - appended and associated minor 
cloud forms and 
 
5) mother-clouds - the origin of clouds if formed from other clouds.  
 The ten cloud genera are cirrus, cirrocumulus, cirrostratus, altocumulus, altostratus, 
nimbostratus, stratocumulus, stratus, cumulus, and cumulonimbus. 
 The fourteen cloud species are fibratus, uncinus, spissatus, castellanus, floccus, 
stratiform, nebulosus, lenticularis, fractus, humilis, mediocris, congestus, calvus, and 
capillatus. 
 The nine cloud varieties are intortus, vertebratus, undulatus, radiatus, lacunosus, 
duplicatus, translucidus, perlucidus, and opacus. 
 The nine supplementary features and accessory clouds are incus, mamma, virga, 
praecipitatio, arcus, tuba, pileus, velum, and pannus. (Note: Although these are Latin 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology

Page 156 of 200.

words, it is proper convention to use only the singular endings, e.g., more than one 
cirrus cloud is cirrus, not cirri.)  
B). A scheme of classifying clouds according to their usual altitudes.  
 
Three classes are distinguished: high, middle, and low. High clouds include cirrus, 
cirrocumulus, cirrostratus, occasionally altostratus, and the tops of cumulonimbus. The middle 
clouds are altocumulus, altostratus, nimbostratus and portions of cumulus and cumulonimbus. 
The low clouds are stratocumulus, stratus and most cumulus and cumulonimbus bases, and 
sometimes nimbostratus. 
C) A scheme of classifying clouds according to their particulate composition, namely, 
water clouds, ice-crystal clouds, and mixed clouds.  
 
The first are composed entirely of water droplets (ordinary and/or supercooled), the 
second entirely of ice crystals, and the third a combination of the first two. Of the cloud genera, 
only cirrostratus and cirrus are always ice-crystal clouds; cirrocumulus can also be mixed; and 
only cumulonimbus is always mixed. Altostratus is nearly always mixed, but can occasionally be 
water. All the rest of the genera are usually water clouds, occasionally mixed; altocumulus, 
cumulus, nimbostratus, and stratocumulus.  
WMO cloud classification 
 
The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) classified the clouds according to their 
height and appearance into 10 categories. From the height, clouds are grouped into 4 
categories (viz., family A, B, C and D) as stated below and there are sub- categories in each of 
these main categories. 
The 4 clouds families, which are in different heights of the troposphere are 
High level clouds (altitudes of 5-13 km) 
Medium level clouds (2-7 km) 
Low level clouds (0-2 km) and  
Clouds with large vertical extending (0-13 km) 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology

Page 157 of 200.

Family A 
 
The clouds in this category are high. The mean lower level is 7 kilometers and the mean 
upper level is 12 kilometers in tropics and sub-tropics. In this family there are three sub-
categories. 
1. Cirrus (Ci) 
 In these clouds ice crystals are present. 
 Looks like wispy and feathery. Delicate, desist, white fibrous, and silky appearance. 
 Sun rays pass through these clouds and sunshine without shadow. 
 Does not produce precipitation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Cirrocumulus (Cc) 
 Like cirrus clouds ice crystals are present in these clouds also. 
 Looks like rippled sand or waves of the sea shore. 
 White globular masses, transparent with no shading effect. 
 Meckerel sky.

3. Cirrostratus (Cs) 
 Like the above two clouds ice crystals are present in these clouds also. 
 Looks like whitish veil and covers the entire sky with milky white appearance. 
 Produces “Halo”. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CIRRUS AND CIRROSTRATUS  
 
Cirrus clouds are higher level clouds that develop in filaments or patches. They are 
virtually brilliant white attributed to their ice crystal composition. However, they lack in contrast 
between the top and base. They occur in flat sheets with a low height to base ratio and are 
usually isolated with large breaks of sky. Cirrus also vary dramatically in 'shape' or patterns they 
portray but these represent the fluctuating wind flow at that level both in the horizontal and 
vertical direction.  
 
Cirrostratus represent clouds that are more widespread than cirrus but containing some 
similar features. Like cirrus, they are brilliant white and lack in contrast. Sunlight can pass 
through cirrostratus but this again depends on the varying thickness of the clouds.  
 
Both cirrus and cirrostratus clouds vary in thickness. The sun can easily be observed 
through both types of clouds although the intensity of light that is observed depends on the 
thickness of their layers. In their thickest form, cirrus and cirrostratus will allow a similar intensity 
of light to pass through to that of thin altostratus. They do not only develop in one complete 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 159 of 200.

layer. It may be difficult to observe because of the lack of contrast but these clouds can consist 
of several thin layers.  
 
Cirrus and cirrostratus tend to move in the direction of the wind at that level which differ 
to that at the surface. The most common direction of motion of these clouds are from a westerly 
direction. This varies with factors such as the latitude, weather conditions and time of the year. 
Their apparent velocities are relatively slow as compared to lower clouds.  
 
Both cirrus and cirrostratus can occur in conjunction with any of the other cloud types. 
Obviously, all the lower and middle level clouds will obscure the view of the higher level clouds, 
appear to move faster and appear less defined. They can only be observed above other clouds 
when breaks in the clouds occur. Any type of higher level clouds can develop simultaneously.  
 
Cirrus clouds tend to develop on days with fine weather and lighter winds at the surface. 
cirrostratus can develop on days with light winds but normally increasing in strength. Although 
both cirrus and cirrostratus tend to develop in fine weather conditions, they also acts as a sign 
of approaching changes in the weather conditions. Such changes could include any of the 
various types of cold front situations, thunderstorms or developing and advancing troughs of low 
pressure, normally with preceding cloud masses.  
 
Except in the latter case, cirrus and cirrostratus will typically precede any other types of 
clouds as part of a cloud band. In fact cirrus normally precedes cirrostratus. Nevertheless, the 
higher level clouds will persist until the actual change in the weather occurs. The higher clouds 
can develop from a few hours up to a few days before an actual change in the weather 
conditions occurs. They may develop during one afternoon and dissipate but redevelop the next 
day and so on until the actual change occurs. If the amount of moisture in the lower layers of the 
atmosphere increases, other lower clouds may also develop changing the appearance of the 
cirrus or the cirrostratus clouds as well as partially or totally hiding them from view. The same 
situation occurs in the case where cirrus develop ahead of thunderstorms. Cirrus normally 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 160 of 200.

precede cirrostratus which are then followed by the anvil of the approaching thunderstorm. In 
fact, cirrus and cirrostratus in this case are the remnants downwind of the weakening anvil.  
 
Both cirrus and cirrostratus can develop and persist after a change has passed through 
a certain location. In this situation, cloud will decrease within a few hours up to a few days 
following the change. If it persists for longer periods, a jet stream cloud mass may be involved.  
 
Another situation where cirrus and cirrostratus can be observed is when lower cloud 
breaks or clears during days with showers or rain. This case is far less common but can indicate 
a few situations. The higher clouds may be the remnants of the cloud mass that produced the 
actual wet weather. They can also be developing ahead of other cloud masses associated with 
another system, leading to the situation already discussed above. It all depends on the weather 
situation at that time but the observation of the movement of the higher level clouds can be 
critical in determining what weather may follow.  
 
Cirrus generally does not produce precipitation except when it results from dissipating 
thunderstorms. Precipitation from such cirrus usually consists of larger droplets and the cloud 
normally dissipates and vanishes completely. cirrostratus does not produce precipitation.  
 
Cirrus and cirrostratus can develop and persist at any time of the day despite the 
perception that it tends to occur during the day. This perception arises because it is much easier 
to observe cirrus during the day as compared to night time. The background darkness and the 
fact that the stars can easily be observed through cirrus and cirrostratus as thin layers allows 
them to camouflage from the view of the observer.  
Cirrocumulus  
 
Cirrocumulus is a higher level cloud that is brilliant white but with a spotty appearance 
created by the many small turrets. The turrets indicate vertical turbulence within the cloud. 
Despite this spotty appearance, cirrocumulus contains many features associated with 
cirrostratus discussed above. It moves in directions similar to that of the other higher clouds. 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 161 of 200.

 
This cloud can develop in conjunction with any other clouds as well as with cirrostratus 
clouds. In Sydney, cirrocumulus is not as common as the other high clouds and mainly develops 
during the winter times with west to south westerly air streams. The development of 
cirrocumulus sometimes occurs in conditions similar to those associated with the development 
lenticular altocumulus. cirrocumulus clouds do not produce precipitation and are normally 
associated with fine weather. 
Family B 
 
The clouds in this category are middle clouds. Middle level clouds are those clouds that 
develop in the middle layers of the atmosphere. These clouds are brighter and less fragmented 
in appearance due to their distance from the ground and the higher composition of ice crystals. 
Middle level clouds vary in thickness from relatively flat sheets of cloud to a more cumuliform 
appearance. In fact, the sun (and moon) can be observed through some thin middle level 
clouds. The mean lower level is 2.5 kilometers and the mean upper level is 7 kilometers in 
tropics and sub-tropics.  
 
Middle level clouds tend to have apparent speeds slower than the lower level clouds. 
They move in the direction of the wind at that level which does not necessarily be the same of 
that at the surface.  
In this family there are 2 sub-categories as details below: 
1. Altocumulus (Ac) 
 In these clouds ice water is present. 
 Greyish or bluish globular masses. 
 Looks like sheep back and also known as flock clouds or wool packed clouds.

2. Alto-stratus (As) 
 
In these clouds water and ice are present separately. 
 
Looks like fibrous veil or sheet and grey or bluish in colour. 
 
Produces coronos and cast shadow. 
 
Rain occurs in middle and high latitudes. 
 
 
 
 
 
Altocumulus  
 
Altocumulus refers to the middle level cloud that exhibit to some extent the features 
normally associated with cumulus. This includes cumuliform tops and bases that are usually 
relatively darker than the tops. This cloud type can be widespread or patchy depending on the 
conditions. It can vary in appearance from broken to smooth, and vary in thickness. 
 
Altocumulus can vary in its apparent movement (speed) depending on the wind and 
direction at that level. However, since altocumulus (like most other cloud types) represents an 
ever changing system, an observer must be careful in determining cloud motion. On some days, 
altocumulus continuously develop as it moves in the direction of the wind. Upstream, more

actual speed. This process can occasionally create an illusion in terms of direction. Considering 
an example of altocumulus observed moving to the south east, because of development on the 
north and north-eastern side of the cloud band, the apparent direction may be more to the east.  
Altocumulus can develop in more than one layer and also in conjunction with other cloud types. 
The lower layer will obscure part or all of the higher altocumulus cloud layer. This situation also 
applies to higher level clouds. Higher level clouds will be obscured by the altocumulus. Lower 
level clouds, however, will obscure part or all of the altocumulus cloud layer. 
ALTOSTRATUS 
 
Altostratus refers to middle level cloud that appears as a flat, smooth dark grey sheet. 
These clouds are most often observed as large sheets rather than isolated areas. However, in 
the process of development, altostratus may develop in smaller filaments and rapidly develop to 
larger sheets. These types of clouds in certain conditions normally indicate an approaching 
cloud mass associated with a cold front, a trough system or a jet stream. 
 
Altostratus can develop into a thick or thin layer. As a thin layer, the sun can be 
observed through the cloud. In its thinner form, the developing altostratus can sometimes be 
confused with approaching cirrostratus. In its thicker form, the sun can only occasionally be 
observed through the thinner sections if not at all. Obviously, the thicker the altostratus, the 
darker it becomes. When observed closely, it becomes apparent that altostratus is not just one 
complete layer but a composition of several thin layers. 
 
Altostratus can produce precipitation. It will normally develop and then thicken. The 
precipitation is observed as relatively thick dark sections since precipitation cascades are very 
difficult to observe with the same colour in the background. In this situation, rain will develop as 
a light shower and gradually increase to showers, light rain or moderate rain. 
Family C 
 
The clouds in this category are lower clouds. The height of these clouds extends from 
ground to upper level of 2.5 kilometers in tropics and sub-tropics. Lower level clouds consist of 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 164 of 200.

those clouds in the lower layers of the atmosphere. Because of the relatively low temperatures 
at this level of the atmosphere, lower level clouds usually reflect lower amounts of light and 
therefore usually exhibit low contrast. The clouds at this level also appear not as well defined. 
When observed closely, it is easy to observe the turbulent motions and hence the ever-
changing structure.  
 
Being closer to the ground, lower level clouds appear to move or progress faster than 
other clouds. The clouds generally move in the direction of the wind very similar to the direction 
of the wind on the ground.  
 
The most efficient method used to recognise lower clouds is when observed in 
conjunction with other clouds. The lower clouds will obscure part or all the view of the upper 
level clouds if they pass in between the observer's line of sight. In other words, all the observer 
can see is the lower clouds as well as parts of the higher level clouds through breaks of the 
lower clouds. In this family, like high clouds, there are 3 sub-categorises. 
1. Strato cumulus (Sc) 
 
These clouds are composed of water. 
 
Looks soft and grey, large globular masses and darker than altocumuls. 
 
Long parallel rolls pushed together or broken masses. 
 
The air is smooth above these clouds but strong updrafts occur below.

2. Stratus (St) 
 
These clouds are also composed of water. 
 
Looks like for as these clouds resemble grayish white sheet covering the entire portion 
of the sky (cloud near the ground). 
 
Mainly seen in winter season and occasional drizzle occurs. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. Nimbostratus (Ns) 
 
These clouds are composed of water or ice crystals. 
 
Looks thick dark, grey and uniform layer which reduces the day light effectively. 
 
Gives steady precipitation. 
 
Sometimes looks like irregular, broken and shapeless sheet like.

Stratocumulus  
 
Stratocumulus are low clouds that generally move faster than cumulus and are not as 
well defined in appearance (recall the techniques of observing clouds). They tend to spread 
more horizontally rather than vertically.  
 
Depending on the weather conditions, stratocumulus can appear like cumulus since 
stratocumulus can develop from cumulus. They may also appear as large flat areas of low, grey 
cloud. Sometimes stratocumulus appear in the form of rolling patches of cloud aligned parallel 
to each other. Stratocumulus can also appear in the form of broken clouds or globules. The sun, 
moon and generally the sky can be observed through the breaks in broken stratocumulus 
clouds. Of course, this depends on how large the breaks are, how high the clouds rise and the 
angle of elevation of the breaks with respect to the observer. This generally applies to all clouds 
but is more notable with clouds in broken form.  
 
Stratocumulus mostly develop in wind streams moving in the direction of the wind similar 
to the direction of the wind at the surface. The friction created by the earth causes turbulence in 
the form of eddies. With sufficient moisture, condensation will occur in the lower layers of the 
atmosphere visible as clouds. The amount of stratocumulus covering the sky depends on the 
amount of moisture concentrated at that level of the atmosphere. The speed that the cloud 
moves varies according to the wind  
Stratus 
 
Stratus is defined as low cloud that appears fragmented and thin. It can also occur in the 
form of a layer or sheet. The sun, moon and generally the sky can usually be observed through 
stratus clouds, especially at a steep angle of elevation. Stratus lacks the vertical growth of 
cumulus and stratocumulus, and therefore lacks the contrast. This is more evident when 
observed as one layer as compared to patchy stratus. Being closest to the ground, stratus 
clouds normally move fairly rapidly in the direction of the wind depending of course on the wind 
speed.  
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 167 of 200.

 
Like stratocumulus, stratus develops under several conditions or weather situations. 
Stratus mostly develop under the influence of wind streams where moisture condenses in the 
lower layers of the atmosphere. Wind changes during the summer months often lead to the 
development of stratus as the wind evaporates moisture from the ocean and condensing as 
turbulence mixes the surface air with the cooler air above. In these conditions, stratus develop 
in patches and gradually may become widespread forming into stratocumulus.  
Family D 
 
These clouds form due to vertical development i.e., due to convection. The mean low 
level is 0.5 and means upper level goes up to 16 kilometers. 
In this family two sub-categories are present. 
1. Cumulus (Cu) 
 
These clouds are composed of water with white majestic appearance with flat base. 
 
Irregular dome shaped and looks like cauliflower with wool pack and dark appearance 
below due to shadow. 
 
These clouds usually develop into cumuolo-nimbus clouds with flat base. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Cumulonimbus (Cb) 
 
The upper levels of these clouds possess ice and water is present at the lower levels. 
 
These clouds have thunder head with towering envil top and develop vertically. 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology

Page 168 of 200.

 
These clouds produce violent winds, thunder storms, hails and lightening, during 
summer. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cumulus  
 
Cumulus are cauliflower-shaped low level clouds with dark bases and bright tops. When 
observing cumulus, you are actually observing the condensation process of rising thermals or 
air bubbles at a certain level in the atmosphere known as the condensation level.  
 
The air rising above this level condenses and cloud is observed. Since the height of this 
level is fairly constant at any particular time, then the bases of cumulus are usually flat. 
PRECIPITATION 
 
When cloud particles become too heavy to remain suspended in the air, they fall to the 
earth as precipitation. Precipitation occurs in a variety of forms; hail, rain, freezing rain, sleet or 
snow. 
Rain 
 
Rain develops when growing cloud droplets become too heavy to remain in the cloud 
and as a result, fall toward the surface as rain. Rain can also begin as ice crystals that collect 
each other to form large snowflakes. As the falling snow passes through the freezing level into 
warmer air, the flakes melt and collapse into rain drops. Rain  is precipitation of liquid water 
particles either in the form of drops having diameter greater than 0.5 mm or in the form of 
smaller widely scattered drops. When the precipitation process is very active, the lower air is 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 169 of 200.

moist and the clouds are very deep, rainfall is in the form of heavy downpour. On occasions, 
falling raindrops completely evaporate before reaching the ground. 
Drizzle: It is fairly uniform precipitation composed of fine drops of water having diameter less 
than 0.5 mm small and uniform size and seems to be floated in the air, it is referred as drizzle. If 
the drops in a drizzle completely evaporates before reaching the ground, the condition is 
referred to as ‘mist’. 
Hail 
 
Hail is a large frozen raindrop produced by intense thunderstorms, where snow and rain 
can coexist in the central updraft. As the snowflakes fall, liquid water freezes onto them forming 
ice pellets that will continue to grow as more and more droplets are accumulated. Upon 
reaching the bottom of the cloud, some of the ice pellets are carried by the updraft back up to 
the top of the storm.  
 
As the ice pellets once again fall through the cloud, another layer of ice is added and the 
hail stone grows even larger. Typically the stronger the updraft, the more times a hail stone 
repeats this cycle and consequently, the larger it grows. Once the hail stone becomes too heavy 
to be supported by the updraft, it falls out of the cloud toward the surface. The hail stone 
reaches the ground as ice since it is not in the warm air below the thunderstorm long enough to 
melt before reaching the ground.  
Freezing rain 
Supercooled droplets freezing on impact  
 
Ice storms can be the most devastating of winter weather phenomena and are often the 
cause of automobile accidents, power outages and personal injury. Ice storms result from the 
accumulation of freezing rain, which is rain that becomes supercooled and freezes upon impact 
with cold surfaces. Freezing rain is most commonly found in a narrow band on the cold side of a 
warm front, where surface temperatures are at or just below freezing.  
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 170 of 200.

 
The diagram below shows a typical temperature profile for freezing rain with the red line 
indicating the atmosphere's temperature at any given altitude. The vertical line in the center of 
the diagram is the freezing line. Temperatures to the left of this line are below freezing, while 
temperatures to the right are above freezing.  
 
 
Freezing rain develops as falling snow encounters a layer of warm air deep enough for 
the snow to completely melt and become rain. As the rain continues to fall, it passes through a 
thin layer of cold air just above the surface and cools to a temperature below freezing. However, 
the drops themselves do not freeze, a phenomena called supercooling (or forming "supercooled 
drops"). When the supercooled drops strike the frozen ground (power lines, or tree branches), 
they instantly freeze, forming a thin film of ice, hence freezing rain.  
Snow 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 171 of 200.

 
It is the precipitation of white and opaque grains of ice. Snow is the precipitation of solid 
water mainly in the form of branched hexagonal crystals of stars. In winter, when temperatures 
are below freezing in the whole atmosphere, the ice crystals falling from the Altostratus do not 
melt and reach the ground as snow. 
 
Sleet  - frozen raindrops that bounce on impact with the ground  
 
Progressing further ahead of the warm front, surface temperatures continue to decrease 
and the freezing rain eventually changes over to sleet. Areas of sleet are located on the colder 
side (typically north) of the freezing rain band.  
 
 
It refers to precipitation in the form of a mixture of rain and snow. It consists of small 
pellets of transparent ice, 5 mm or less in diameter. It refers to a frozen rain that forms when 
rain falling to the earth passing through a layer of cold air and freezes. This happens when 
temperature is very low. It is not commonly seen in India expect high ranges, that too in winter, 
in extreme north and northeast India. 
 
Sleet is less prevalent than freezing rain and is defined as frozen raindrops that bounce 
on impact with the ground or other objects. The diagram below shows a typical temperature 
profile for sleet with the red line indicating the atmosphere's temperature at any given altitude. 
The vertical line in the center of the diagram is the freezing line. Temperatures to the left of this 
line are below freezing, while temperatures to the right are above freezing.  
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology

Sleet is more difficult to forecast than freezing rain because it develops under more specialized 
atmospheric conditions. It is very similar to freezing rain in that it causes surfaces to become 
very slick, but is different because its easily visible.  
 
Snow - an aggregate of ice crystals  
 
Progressing even further away from the warm front, surface temperatures continue to 
decrease and the sleet changes over to snow.  
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology

Page 173 of 200.

 
 
Snowflakes are simply aggregates of ice crystals that collect to each other as they fall 
toward the surface. The diagram below shows a typical temperature profile for snow with the red 
line indicating the atmosphere's temperature at any given altitude. The vertical line in the center 
of the diagram is the freezing line. Temperatures to the left of this line are below freezing, while 
temperatures to the right are above freezing.  
 
 
Since the snowflakes do not pass through a layer of air warm enough to cause them to 
melt, they remain intact and reach the ground as snow.  
Hail 
 
Precipitation of small pieces of ice with diameter ranging from 5 to 50 mm or something 
more is known as hail. Hailstorms are frequent in tropics. In India, the period from March to May

offers the ideal condition for hailstorms. It is the most dreaded and destructive form of 
precipitation produced in thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds. 
Isohyets 
 
Isohyets are the lines connecting various locations, having an equal amount of 
precipitation.

WEATHER ABERRATIONS 
DROUGHT 
 The term drought can be defined by several ways. 
1. The condition under which crops fail to mature because of insufficient supply of water 
through rains. 
2. The situation in which the amount of water required for transpiration and evaporation 
by crop plants in a defined area exceeds the amount of available moisture in the soil. 
3. A situation of no precipitation in a rainy season for more than 15 days continuously. 
Such length of non-rainy days can also be called as dry spells. 
Classification of Drought 
Droughts are broadly divided into 3 categories based on the nature of impact and 
spatial extent. 
i. Meteorological Drought 
If annual rainfall is significantly short of certain level (75 per cent) of the 
climatologically expected normal rainfall over a wide area, then the situation is called 
meteorological drought. In every state each region receives certain amount of normal 
rainfall. This is the basis for planning the cropping pattern of that region or area. 
ii. Hydrological drought 
This is a situation in which the hydrological resources like streams, rivers, 
reservoirs, lakes, wells etc dry up because of marked depletion of surface water. The 
ground water table also depletes. The industry, power generation and other income 
generating major sources are affected. If Meteorological drought is significantly 
prolonged, the hydrological drought sets in. 
iii. Agricultural Drought 
This is a situation, which is a result of inadequate rainfall and followed by soil moisture 
deficit. As a result, the soil moisture falls short to meet the demands of the crops during 
Lecture 23

its growth. Since, the soil moisture available to a crops insufficient, it affects growth and 
finally results in the reduction of yield. This is further classified as early season drought, 
mid season drought and late season drought.  
Flood 
Years in which actual rainfall is ‘above’ the normal by twice the mean 
deviation or more is defined as years of floods or excessive rainfall. Like droughts, the 
definition of floods also varies one situation to another and form one region to other. 
Some of the flood years characterized based on the spatial damage due to high and 
intense rainfall in India are as follows. 
India: 1878,1872,1917,1933,1942,1956,1959,1961,1970,1975,1983,1988.

WEATHER FORECASTING 
Climatic normals 
 
The climatic normals are the average value of 30 years of a particular weather 
element. The period may be week, month and year. The crop distribution, production 
and productivity depend on the climatic normals of a place. If the crops are selected for 
cultivation based on the optimum climatic requirements it is likely that the crop 
production can be maximized. 
 
Weather forecast 
The prediction of weather for the next few days to follow. The Figure below 
depicts different weather forecasting services normally practiced in a country. 
NEED / IMPORTANCE OF FORECAST

• 
The planning for moisture conservation under weak monsoon condition and for 
flood relief under strong monsoon condition is important in a region. 
• 
A reliable weather forecasting when disseminated appropriately will pave way for 
the effective sustainability.

This means that in good monsoon years when prices fall, the government may 
step in and buy and in bad years when price tend to rise, it may unload a part of 
what it had purchased.

Synoptic charts 
 
An enormous volume of meteorological data is being collected from all over the 
world continuously round the clock through various telecommunication channels. To 
assess, assimilate and analyse the vast data, they have to be suitably presented. For 
this purpose, the observations are plotted on maps instandard weather codes. These 
maps are called ‘Synoptic maps or charts’. Synoptic charts display the weather 
conditions at a specified time over a large geographical area. The surface synoptic 
charts plotted for different synoptic hours (00, 03, 06, 09, 12, 15, 18, 21 UTC) depict the 
distribution of pressure, temperature, dew point, clouds, winds, present and past 
weather. In place of GMT, UTC (Universal Time Co-ordinate) is used. The upper air 
charts are also prepared at the standard pressure levels of the atmosphere (different 
heights) of the atmosphere wherein the pressure, wind and temperature are plotted. The 
surface charts together with the upper air charts provide a composite three-dimensional 
weather picture pertaining to a given time. Thus it gives a birds eye view of the state of 
atmosphere at a time over a large area and is a important tool used by operational 
meteorologists and scientists. The surface synoptic charts are the most used charts. It 
contains the maximum number of observations with the largest number of parameters 
plotted and often forms the base on which the pressure level charts are built up. The 
pattern of the pressure distribution is brought out by drawing isobars, troughs, ridges, 
lows, highs, depressions, cyclones, cols, fronts and discontinuities. These systems are 
clearly marked and labeled using appropriate symbols and colours. In synoptic charts 
different weather phenomena and atmospheric characters are marked with different 
symbols as mentioned below.

Weather calendar 
In order to provide the farmers with an efficient weather service, it is essential 
that the weather forecaster should be familiar with the crops that are grown in a 
particular agroclimatic zone. The type of forewarnings to be given depend on the stages 
of the crop. In case of farmers, they should become familiar with weather bulletins and 
learn how to interpret. To meet the above requirement, the detailed information collected

from the agricultural departments has been condensed by the IMD and presented in a 
pictorial form known as crop weather calendar. This calendar has three parts as follows. 
a) Bottom part 
b) Middle part 
c) Top part 
a) Bottom part provides the activities related to crop or information related to 
phenological stages of the crop and the months. 
b) Middle part gives information regarding normal weather condition required for active 
crop growth. It is divided into different sections according to rainfall, rainy days, minimum 
temperature, maximum temperature, pan evaporation and sunshine hours. 
c) Top part gives information related to the weather abnormalities or to take 
precautionary measures. Top part is divided into different sections according to dry spell 
length, high wind, heavy rainfall and cloudy weather.

WEATHER MODIFICATION – ARTIFICIAL RAIN MAKING AND CLOUD SEEDING 
 
Weather modification refers to willful manipulation of the climate or local weather. 
Research done in this field goes back to as far as the early 1940s when the US military 
experimented with cloud seeding to stimulate rain. Today, private corporations have 
joined the weather modification research effort to protect people, cities and assets from 
the damage extreme weather brings. 
Principles of rainmaking 
Clouds are classified into warm and cold clouds based on cloud top temperature. 
If the cloud temperature is positive these clouds are called warm clouds and if it is 
negative they are called as cold clouds. The nucleus needed for precipitation differs with 
type of clouds. Hygroscopic materials are necessary as nucleus for warm clouds 
History of Cloud Seeding 
 
Cloud seeding experiments started with the work of a scientist from General 
Electric named Vincent Schaefer who discovered that ice crystals can induce 
precipitation. Since ice crystals are difficult to transport and spread over an area, silver 
iodide, a compound with similar properties, was used as a substitute. The experiments 
continued until the 1970's when the program was shelved because of lack of usable 
results. 
Cloud seeding 
Cloud seeding is one of the tools to mitigate the effects of drought. It is defined 
as a process in which the precipitation is encouraged by injecting artificial condensation 
nuclei through aircrafts or suitable mechanism to induce rain from rain bearing cloud. 
The raindrops are several times heavier than cloud droplets. These mechanisms are 
different for cold and warm clouds. 
Lecture 25
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology

Page 185 of 200.

How it Works 
 
Cloud seeding involves the use of water-absorbent materials to encourage the 
formation of clouds and rain so that there could be increased crop production in areas 
where there's little water. This practice has already been implemented in some areas like 
Texas and Utah, though not without its share of controversies. The effectiveness of 
cloud seeding cannot be proven and some worry that it may actually cause harm. 
Cloud seeding useful in the following applications 
Increasing Precipitation 
 
The most common application of cloud seeding is to increase precipitation, 
possible with both warm and cold clouds. There are two primary methods employed to 
stimulate precipitation. One, hygroscopic seeding, affects warm cloud processes. The 
other, glaciogenic seeding initiates cold cloud processes. 
 
Though occasionally both techniques may be helpful, in most cases one can be 
utilized more effectively than the other. In addition, either technology can be applied from 
the surface (ground-based) or from an aircraft. Weather Modification, Inc. can help you 
decide which method will be most effective. 
Augmenting Snowfall 
 
Glaciogenic seeding can also be used to increase precipitation from stratiform 
and orographic clouds. In such cases, seeding may be accomplished through either 
ground-based or airborne modes. By increasing snowpack and resultant spring runoff, 
subsequent water supplies for hydropower are increased. In addition to alleviating the 
need for alternative costly power supplies, cloud seeding increases the water availability 
for municipal, recreational, and environmental interests. 
Enhancing Rainfall 
 
Efforts to increase rainfall during the warm seasons are typically aimed at 
convective clouds. While it is theoretically possible to seed such clouds using ground-
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 186 of 200.

based equipment, targeting from aircraft is much more efficient and accurate. It is 
usually possible to affect the cloud through releases of a seeding agent in sub-cloud 
updrafts, or by dropping the seeding agents directly into the upper regions of the clouds. 
Warm season glaciogenic seeding is typically applied to treat supercooled cumulus 
congestus clouds, either by releasing the ice-forming (nucleating) seeding agent in the 
updraft beneath the actively-growing cumulus, or by dropping the nucleating agent 
directly into the supercooled cloud top. The seeding agents can produce ice at 
significantly warmer temperatures than the natural process. This is how glaciogenic 
seeding gives the treated cloud a head start in producing precipitation.  
 
When clouds do not grow tall and cold enough to produce precipitation through 
the Bergeron process, it may be possible to stimulate precipitation growth by seeding 
these warm clouds with hygroscopic seeding agents. This approach can be quite 
successful through stimulation of the warm cloud precipitation processes. Hygroscopic 
seeding is normally done from aircraft flying in the sub-cloud updrafts, in order to affect 
the initial cloud droplet development which occurs in this zone. 
Mitigating Hail Damage 
 
Cloud seeding can be used as a tool to help mitigate hail damage and protect 
crop yields, homes and other property, thus reducing the economic harm from disastrous 
storm damage. Since hail is itself ice that is produced only by vigorous convective 
clouds, it is certain that such clouds are cold enough to be amenable to glaciogenic 
seeding techniques. Hail develops when excess supercooled liquid water develops 
within strong updrafts. However, if the excess might be induced to freeze into large 
numbers of small particles rather than much smaller numbers of large particles, the ice 
that does precipitate may melt during its transit through the warm sub-cloud layer, or if it 
doesn't it will reach the surface as much smaller, less-damaging, ice. 
Dispersing Fog 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology
www.AgriMoon.Com
Page 187 of 200.

 
Another useful application for cloud seeding is the treatment of ground-based 
clouds, also known as fog. Supercooled fogs, comprised of water droplets at 
temperatures cold enough to permit ice development, can easily be cleared by 
glaciogenic seeding. This can be done either from the ground or from airborne 
application. Your choice between the two will depend on characteristics such as local 
infrastructure, topography, and wind. 
Seeding of cold clouds 
 
This can be achieved by two ways (1. Dry ice seeding and 2. Silver Iodide 
seeding). 
1. Dry ice seeding 
• 
Dry ice (solid carbon-dioxide) has certain specific features. It remains as it is at   
–80oC and evaporates, but does not melt. Dry ice is heavy and falls rapidly from 
top of cloud and has no persistent effects due to cloud seeding. 
• 
Aircrafts are commonly used for cloud seeding with dry ice. 
• 
Aircraft flies across the top of a cloud and 0.5 – 1.0 cm dry ice pellets are 
released in a steady stream. 
• 
While falling through the cloud a sheet of ice crystals is formed. 
• 
From these ice crystals rain occurs. 
• 
This method is not economical as 250 kg of dry ice is required for seeding one 
cloud. To carry the heavy dry ice over the top of clouds special aircrafts are 
required, which is an expensive process. 
2. Silver Iodide seeding 
Minute crystals of silver iodide produced in the form of smoke acts as efficient 
ice-farming nuclei at temperatures below –5ｰC. When these nuclei are produced from 
the ground generators, these particles are fine enough to diffuse with air currents. Silver

iodide is the most effective nucleating substance because; its atomic arrangement is 
similar to that of ice. The time for silver iodide smoke released from ground generator to 
reach the super cooled clouds was offer some hours, during which it would draft a long 
way and decay under the sun light. The appropriate procedure for seeding cold clouds 
would be to release silver iodide smoke into super cooled cloud from an aircraft. In 
seeding cold clouds silver iodide technique is more useful than dry ice techniques, 
because, very much less of silver iodide is required per cloud. There is no necessity to 
fly to the top of the cloud, if area to be covered is large. 
Seeding of warm clouds 
1) Water drop Technique 
Coalescence process is mainly responsible for growth of rain drops in warm 
cloud. The basic assumption is that the presence of comparatively large water droplets 
is necessary to initiate the coalescence process. So, water droplets or large hygroscopic 
nuclei are introduced in to the cloud. Water drops of 25 mm are sprayed from aircraft at 
the rate of 30 gallons per seeding on warm clouds. 
2) Common salt technique 
Common salt is a suitable seeding material for seeding warm clouds. It is used 
either in the form of 10 per cent solution or solid. A mixture of salt and soap avoid 
practical problems. The spraying is done by power sprayers and air compressors or 
even from ground generators. The balloon burst technique is also beneficial. In this case 
gunpowder and sodium chloride are arranged to explode near cloud base dispersing salt 
particles.

REMOTE SENSING 
Remote sensing is defined as the art and science of gathering information about objects 
or areas from a distance without having physical contact with objects area being 
investigated. 
Uses: Remote sensing techniques are used in agricultural and allied fields. 
1. Collection of basic data for monitoring of crop growth 
2. Estimating the cropped area 
3. Forecasting the crop production 
4. Mapping of wastelands 
5. Drought monitoring and its assessment 
6. Flood mapping and damage assessment 
7. Land use/cover mapping and area under forest coverage 
8. Soil mapping 
9. Assessing soil moisture condition, irrigation, drainage 
10. Assessing outbreak of pest and disease 
11. Ground water exploration 
Remote Sensing platforms: 
Three platforms are generally used for remote sensing techniques. They are 
ground based, air based and satellite based. Infrared thermometer, Spectral radiometer, 
Pilot-Balloons and Radars are some of the ground based remote sensing tools while 
aircrafts air based remote sensing tools. Since the ground based and air based 
platforms are very costly and have limited use, space based satellite technology has 
become handy for wider application of remote sensing techniques. The digital image 
processing, using powerful computers, is the key tool for analyzing and interpretation of 
remotely sensed data. The advantages of satellite remote sensing are:

Synoptic view – Wide area can be covered by a single image/photo (One scene of Indian 
Remote Sensing Satellite IRS series cover about 148 x 178 sq.km area). 
Receptivity – Can get the data of any area repeatedly (IRS series cover the same area 
every 16- 22 days). 
Coverage – Inaccessible areas like mountains, swampy areas and thick forests are 
easily covered. Space based remote sensing is the process of obtaining information 
about the earth from the instruments mounted on the Earth Observation Satellites. The 
satellites are subdivided into two classes and the types of satellite are as follows: 
Polar orbiting satellites 
These satellites operate at an altitude between 550 and 1,600 km along an 
inclined circular plane over the poles. These satellites are used for remote sensing 
purposes. LANDSAT (USA), SPOT (FRANCE), and IRS (INDIA) are some of the 
Remote Sensing Satellites. 
Geostationary satellite 
These have orbits around the equator at an altitude of 36,000 km and move with 
the same speed as the earth so as to view the same area on the earth continuously. 
They are used for telecommunication and weather forecasting purposes. INSAT series 
are launched from India for the above purposes. All these satellites have sensors on 
board operating in the visible and near infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
INSAT-3A was launched on 10th April, 2003. 
Role of Remote Sensing in agriculture 
Agricultural resources are important renewable dynamic natural resources. In 
India, agriculture sector alone sustains the livelihood of around 70 percent of the 
population and contributes nearly 35 percent of the net national product. Increasing 
agricultural productivity has been the main concern since scope for increasing area

under agriculture is rather limited. This demands judicious and optimal management of 
both land and water resources. Hence, comprehensive and reliable information on land 
use/cover, forest area, soils, geological information, extent of wastelands, agricultural 
crops, water resources both surface and underground and hazards/natural calamities 
like drought and floods is required. Season-wise information on crops, their acreage, 
vigour and production enables the country to adopt suitable measures to meet 
shortages, if any, and implement proper support and procurement policies. Remote 
Sensing systems, having capability of providing regular, synoptic, multi-temporal and 
multi-spectral coverage of the country, are playing an important role in providing such 
information. A large number of experiments have been carried out in developing 
techniques for extracting agriculture related information from ground borne, air borne 
and space borne data. 
Indian Remote Sensing programme: 
India, with the experience gained from its experimental remote sensing satellite 
missions BHASKARA-I and II, has now established satellite based operational remote 
sensing system in the country with the launch of Indian Remote Sensing Satellite IRS-IA 
in 1988, followed by IRS-IB (1992), IRS-IC (1995) and IRS-ID (1997). The Department of 
Space (DOS) / Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) as the nodal agency for 
establishing an operation remote sensing system in the country initiated efforts in the 
early 1970s for assessing the potentials of remotely sensed data through several means. 
In order to meet the user requirement of remote sensing data analysis and interpretation, 
ISRO/DOS has set up a system to launch remote sensing satellites once in three or four 
years to maintain the continuity in data collection. The remote sensing and some of its 
related institutes are depicted.

Crop weather modeling 
Crop model 
It is a representation of a crop through mathematical equations explaining the 
crops interaction with both above ground and below ground environment. The increase 
in dry matter of the crop is referred to as growth. The rate of growth of a healthy crop 
depends on the rate at which radiation is intercepted by foliage and / or on the rate at 
which water and nutrients are captured by root systems and therefore on the distribution 
of water and nutrients in the soil profile. The crop development is described in terms of 
various phenophases through which the crop completes its lifecycle. That is the progress 
of the crop from seeding or primordial initiation to maturity. Finally the yield of crop stand 
is expresses as a product of three components, viz., the period over which dry matter is 
accumulated (the length of the growing period), the mean rate at which dry matter is 
accumulated and the fraction of dry matter treated as yield when the crop is harvested. It 
is understood that the crop growth, development and yield depend upon the mean daily 
temperature (DTT), the length of the day and the amount of solar radiation (PAR) 
received by the crop. 
DTT = Max daily temperature + Min daily temperature  
- base temperature

Where, DTT = Daily thermal time accumulation. 
The time needed for the crop to reach a development stage depends upon temperature 
measured above a base value (DTT) and for photo periodically sensitive phases such as 
flowering, the day length above a fixed base. In the absence of stress, the harvest index 
does not vary much from year to year for a specified cultivar / variety. Therefore, crop 
weather modeling is based on the principles that govern the development of crop and its 
growing period based on temperature and / or day length. They are used to quantify the 
rate of crop growth in terms of radiation interception, water use and nutrient supply 
which moderate harvest index when the crops experience stress condition. The basic 
information required to be generated for crop weather modeling includes. 
a) Crop phonology in relation to the temperature and day length 
b) Water use by the crop during different phenophases of crop growth 
c) The relationship between radiation interception, crop water use and total dry matter 
production 
d) Partitioning of dry matter into various plant components as influenced by water and 
nutrient availability, and 
e) The effect of weather parameters on biotic interference to crop growth. 
Types of models 
a) Statistical models 
These models express the relationship between the yield or yield components 
and the weather parameters. The relationships are measured in a system using 
statistical techniques. Simple regression techniques explaining weather crop 
relationships are also considered as models. 
b) Mechanistic model 
These models explain not only the relationships between the weather parameters 
and the yield, but explain the relationship of influencing dependent variables. 
Principles of Agronomy & Agricultural Meteorology

Page 194 of 200.

c) Deterministic models 
These models estimate the exact value of the yield or dependent variable. These 
models also have defined co-efficient. 
d) Stochastic models 
A probability element is attached to each output. For each set of inputs different 
outputs are given along with probabilities. These models define the yield or state of 
dependent variable at a given rate. 
e) Dynamic models 
Time is included as a variable. Both dependent and independent variables are 
having values which remain constant over a given period of time. Over a period of time 
these variables are changing due to change in rate of increment. 
f) Static models 
Time is not included as a variable. The dependent and independent variables 
having values remain constant over a given period of time. 
g) Simulation models 
Computer models in general, are a mathematical representation of a real world 
system. One of the main goals of crop simulation models is to estimate agricultural 
production as a function of weather and soil conditions as well as crop management. 
These models use one or more sets of differential equations over time, normally from 
planting until harvest maturity or final harvest. 
h) Descriptive models 
A descriptive model defines the behaviour of a system in a simple manner. The 
model reflects little or none of the mechanisms that are the causes of phenomena but 
consists of one or more mathematical equations. An example of such an equation is the 
one derived from successively measured weights quickly the weight of the crop where 
no observation was made.

i) Explanatory models 
This model consists of quantitative description of the mechanisms and process 
that cause the behaviour of the system. To create this model, a system is analyzed and 
its process and mechanisms are quantified separately. The model is built by integrating 
these descriptions for the entire system. It contains descriptions of distinct processes 
such as leaf area expansion, tiller production etc. Crop growth is a consequence of 
these processes. 
Climate change and variability 
Climate change 
Any permanent change in weather phenomena from the normals of a long period 
average is referred as climate change. Eg. The global temperature has increased by 2.0 
to 3.0 C and increase in CO2 from 180ppm to 350ppm. 
Climate variability 
The temporal changes in weather phenomena which is part of general circulation 
of atmosphere and occurs on a yearly basis on a global scale. Climate change and 
climate variability are the concern of human kind in recent decades all over the world. 
The recurrent drought and desertification seriously threaten the livelihood of over 1-2 
billion people who depend on the land for most of their needs. The weather related 
disasters viz. drought and floods, ice storms, dust storms, land slides, thunder clouds 
associated with lightening and forest fires are uncommon over one or other region of the 
world. The year 1998 was one of the recent weather related disaster years, which 
caused hurricane house in Central America and floods in China, India and Bangladesh. 
Canada and New England in the U.S. suffered heavily due to ice storm in January while 
Turkey, Argentina and Paraguay with floods in June 1998. Vast fires in Siberia burned 
over three million acres of forests. Human and crop losses are the worst phenomena in 
such weather disasters, affecting global economy to a considerable extent. The 1997-

’98 El-Nino events, the strongest of the last century is estimated to have affected 110 
million people and cost the global economy nearly US $ 100 billion. Statistics compiled 
from insurance companies for the period 1950-1999. Show that major natural 
catastrophes which are mainly weather and climate related caused estimated economic 
losses of US $ 960 billion. Most of the losses were recorded in recent decades. Increase 
in aerosols due to emission of green house gases including black carbon and 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCS), ozone depletion, UV-B filtered radiation, cold and heat 
waves, global cooling and warming and “human hand” in the form of deforestation 
and loss of wetlands in the process of imbalanced development for betterment of human 
kind may be caused factors for climate variability and climate change. 
Causes of climatic variability 
A. External causes 
i) Solar output: An increase in solar output by 0.3%when compared to 1650 -1700AD 
data. 
ii) Orbital variation:  
1. Earth orbit varies form almost a complete circle to marked ellipse (Eccentricity). 
2. Wobble of earth’s axis (Precession of equinox) 3. Tilt of the earth’s axis of 
rotation relative to the plane of the orbit varies between 21.8o and 24.4 o. 
B. Internal causes 
i) Changes in the atmospheric composition. Change in the green house gases especially 
CO2 
ii) Land surface changes particularly the afforestation and deforestation 
iii) The internal dynamics of southern oscillation – changes in the sea surface 
temperature in western tropical Pacific (El-Nino/La-Nina) coupled with Southern

Oscillation Index, the Tahiti minus Darwin normalized pressure index leading to the 
ENSO phenomena 
iv) Anthropogenic causes of climate variation in green house gases and aerosols. 
Effects of climate change 
1. The increase concentration of CO2 and other green house gases are expected to 
increase the temperature of the earth. 
2. Crop production is weather dependant and any change will have major effects on crop 
production and productivity. 
3. Elevated CO2 and temperature affects the biological process like respiration, 
photosynthesis, plant growth, reproduction, water use etc. Depending on the latitude the 
CO2 may either offer beneficial effect or may behave otherwise also. 
El-Nino and La-Nina 
El-Nino is a Spanish word meaning “the boy child” (‘Child Christ’) because 
El-Nino occurs around Christmas time each year when the waters off the Peruvian coast 
warm slightly. In every three to six years, the waters become unusually warm. 'El Ni' is 
now used more widely to refer to this abnormal warming of the ocean and the resulting 
effects on weather. 'El Nino' is often coupled with 'Southern Oscillation' as the acronym 
ENSO. 'La Nino' is used popularly to signify the opposite of El Nino occurring when the 
waters of the eastern Pacific are abnormally cold. La Nino episodes are associated with 
more rainfall over eastern Australia, and continuing drought in Peru. Peruvian 
meteorologists have objected to term La Nino-the Girl Child-because Christ is not known 
to have had a sister, and the term anti-ENSO is sometimes preferred. The El-Nino event 
is due to decrease in atmospheric pressure over the South East Pacific Ocean. At the 
same time, the atmospheric pressure over Indonesia and North Australia increases. 
Once the El-Nino event is over, the atmospheric pressure over the above regions swings

back. This sea-saw pattern of atmospheric pressure is called Southern Oscillation. Since 
El-Nino and Southern Oscillation are linked they often termed as ENSO. It is most 
important one, which represents a tendency for high atmospheric pressure over the 
Pacific Ocean, represents to be associated with low pressure over the Indian Ocean and 
vice-versa. A measure of the monsoon low pressure is the Southern Oscillation Index 
(SOI) represented by the difference in sea level pressure over Tahiti, an Island in South 
central pacific and Darwin in North Australia, which represents the northern part of the 
Indian Ocean. The positive SOI denotes high pressure over the central pacific and low 
over Indonesia, North Australia and Northern Indian Ocean. Above average rainfall is 
expected over India, India and Indonesia and North Australia if the SOI is positive. 
Drought or deficit rainfall is expected in the above countries if the SOI is negative, 
indicating high atmospheric pressure over Indonesia and low in the central pacific.
